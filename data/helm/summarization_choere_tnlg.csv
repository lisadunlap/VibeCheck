"More than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation . Royal Mail has stepped up the amount of junk mail it stuffs through our doors since it was sold off by the Government, new figures show. More than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation – sparking fears that it risks becoming a ‘leaflet distributor’. In the 12 months after privatisation, postmen pushed almost 50,000 more leaflets and advertising letters through our doors every single day, compared to the previous year. It means almost 3.2bn items of ‘unaddressed’ junk mail were delivered in just one year – almost double the 1.7bn delivered annually five years ago. These figures do not even include the vast quantities of ‘addressed’ junk mail also delivered, which have the names of occupants on the envelope. The rise in unsolicited mail has proved lucrative for Royal Mail, which is struggling from increased competition in the parcels market and a fall in the number of ordinary letters being posted. Revenue from ‘marketing mail’ – addressed and unaddressed – has soared to £1.1bn a year, earning them £3million a day. Critics last night called for Royal Mail to reduce the amount of ‘nuisance’ junk mail it delivers or risk becoming a ‘leaflet distributor’. Royal Mail admitted junk Mail had become an ‘important component’ of its business, and insisted many households found advertising flyers ‘useful’. But much of unwanted junk mail is never opened and ends up being thrown straight into the bin – causing an environmental headache. While some households recycle takeaway menus and pamphlets, many tonnes of junk mail end up in landfill – costing councils tens of millions of pounds to dispose of. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘Junk mail is a blight on the nation’s doormats. ‘Not only is it a nuisance to pick up and throw away, it adds thousands of tonnes to the waste councils have to pick up creating additional costs for tax payers. ‘Royal Mail and its direct marketing clients have to do far more to reduce the torrent of junk mail.’ Robert Rijkhoff, of the Stop Junk Mail campaign, said marketing mail was ‘the worst form of advertising’ because it was foisted upon households without their consent. He said: ‘Royal Mail needs to make money but, if they deliver more and more junk mail as a source of income, in the long term I am not sure it is a sustainable business. ‘Royal Mail is delivering less and less letters. They are risking that, in time, they will become a leaflet distributor.’ Critics claim that some junk mail contain scams sent by fraudsters from overseas. Critics said the company was running the risk of being labelled a 'leaflet distributor' with fewer letters being posted every year . In 2011, the National Fraud Authority claimed the Royal Mail logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy, making the scammers appear more trustworthy. At the time, Mike Haley, director of the National Fraud Authority, Royal Mail

"The Director of Public Prosecutions was under growing pressure to stand down last night over her failure to put Lord Janner on trial for serious child abuse offences. Alison Saunders’s position as the country’s top prosecutor looked bleak as she faced unprecedented criticism from the Home Secretary, police chiefs, crime tsars, prominent MPs – and even one of her predecessors. Mrs Saunders said her job as head of the Crown Prosecution Service was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases, not the most popular ones. But she was accused of ignoring the rights of victims and of perpetrating Establishment cover-ups by deciding that Labour peer Lord Janner should not be charged – despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims dating back to the 1960s. Birthday visit: Lord Janner, right with cake, took Michael Jackson - who was repeatedly accused of child abuse but cleared in court - on tour of Parliament in 2002, together with their mutual friend of Uri Gellar and US magician David Blaine (centre, left). It was the birthday of Labour MP Paul Boateng, alongside Janner . Theresa May became the first Cabinet Minister to question the DPP’s judgment in ruling that the 86-year-old should not be prosecuted on the grounds that his dementia is now too advanced for him to have a fair trial. The Home Secretary told the BBC: ‘I was very concerned when I heard about this decision. I have been very clear in everything I have said so far about the child sexual abuse issue… I expect to see justice done.’ Former DPP Lord Macdonald of River Glaven said it would have been better if Lord Janner had undergone a procedure whereby a jury can decide on the facts of a case without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed, if a suspect is unfit to plead. There have been a number of recent court cases in which defendants with dementia have been jailed, and Lord Janner himself has previously called for Nazi war criminals to be put on trial regardless of their age or frailty. Lord Macdonald added: ‘It might have been wiser for the Crown Prosecution Service to say, ‘‘We’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the DPP.’’ ’ Adam Simmonds, Police and Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire, said the decision not to charge Lord Janner on Thursday made it a ‘dark day for our justice system’. He added: ‘A substantial number of victims of child abuse, who have carried the weight of such heinous crimes with them for the best part of two decades, have been terribly let down in the worst possible way.’ He said the DPP’s ruling went against her previously stated commitment to seek justice for victims, no matter how old the allegations. Alison Saunders, right, said her job as head of the Crown Prosecution Service was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases, not the most popular ones, Lord Janner, left .

"He has been embroiled in a well-documented feud with Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana after the former called babies born through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) 'synthetic'. But Sir Elton John - whose two sons Zachary, four, and Elijah, two, were conceived with the help of a surrogate and artificial insemination - appeared to offer an olive branch when he declared his love for the fashion duo in Las Vegas on Wednesday night. Speaking on stage at his concert at the Colosseum, Elton included the pair in a list of inspirational people who have changed the world, such as Nelson Mandela and Lady Diana, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . 'I love Dolce & Gabbana!' Elton John (pictured on March 11) spoke from the stage on Wednesday night where he declared his love for D&G despite a recent feud . Famous fans! Elton's show was watched by newly single Bradley Cooper, Miles Tellar, Jonah Hill and British comedian Jimmy Carr on Wednesday . While his praise for the designers was greeted with laughter by the audience, Elton went on to add: 'Listen, the band have been wearing Dolce & Gabbana, I love Dolce & Gabbana clothes.' Sir Elton announced last week that he would boycott the brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised IVF, saying: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that. That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies.' Elton, who is married to David Furnish, responded furiously, writing on Sunday: 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as ""synthetic"". Controversy: Designer Domenico Dolce (right) has defended his controversial remarks and said he 'respects all the world'. He is pictured with business partner Stefano Gabbana (left) 'And shame on you for wagging your judgmental little fingers at IVF – a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children. 'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.' His outburst prompted a mass social media campaign, as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand. Boycott: Sir Elton John (pictured with his husband David Furnish and their children), spoke out against Dolce and Gabbana and claimed that he will never wear any of their clothes ever again after their comments . Equality campaigners and celebrities also weighed in on the dispute - gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has organised a protest outside D&G's London store on Thurday to show the public's opposition to the inflammatory comments. Victoria Beckham, a former Dolce and Gabbana ambassador who is close friends with Sir Elton, offered her support with the message: 'Sending love to Elton David Zachary Elijah & all the beautiful IVF babies x vb.'

"It was all's well that ends well for this young elephant after it fell into a mud pit in Kenya. After wallowing in the dank ditch for up to 12 hours, these images and video capture the dramatic moment a digger saved the large mammal from a trunkful of trouble in a heroic rescue mission. The heart-rending rescue took place near Makindu in southern Kenya, where local farmers were shocked to find the distressed male elephant desperately trying to escape from a deep mud pit. Scroll down for video . The digger gets to work to save the stricken elephant after he got stuck in the well in Chyulu Hills National Park, southern Kenya . The young mammal was stuck wallowing in the dank ditch for up to 12 hours before he was able to make its way out of the muddy water . This is the moment the elephant made its break for safety, after the digger was able to create a gentle slope out of the heavy clay . Unable to help the large mammal climb the steep clay sides, wildlife conservationists enlisted the aid of a heroic construction company, who used their digger to plough the elephant to safety. Conservation scientist and wildlife photographer Jeremy Goss, 30, was on the scene to capture these dramatic photos and video footage of the courageous rescue on farmland bordering Chyulu Hills National Park. He said: 'It was heartbreaking to see the elephant in the well, particularly because the community had not been very keen or able to help it out. 'Elephants raid their crops and are generally not welcome, but it was a shocking sight for them nonetheless.' It is believed the young African elephant, which can weigh up to seven tonnes, the same weight as a London double decker bus, had been trapped in the murky sludge for up to 12 hours after it fell in the well while taking a drink.

"Sacked: But Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the incident which got him sacked from Top Gear . Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the attack on a Top Gear producer which led to him being sacked from the hit BBC show. Police had opened an investigation into the incident, which took place at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire last month after Clarkson had been filming Top Gear in the area. However, after the victim Oisin Tymon said that he did not want to press charges, officers have now decided to drop the probe without taking action against Clarkson. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘North Yorkshire Police has now completed its routine enquiries following the incident at Hawes involving Mr Jeremy Clarkson, and we will not be pursuing this matter any further. ‘North Yorkshire Police takes a thorough and victim-led approach to all investigations. ‘Last week, the person at the centre of the incident, Mr Tymon, said that he did not wish the police to take action on his behalf. ‘However, at that point we still needed to speak to some members of the public who were present at the time of the incident, who had been affected by the event, and whose views also needed to be considered. ‘Now that all the interviews are complete, we have properly established that there is no need for further police action.’ The incident, described as a 'fracas' by BBC officials, occurred when Clarkson discovered that the hotel where he was staying could not serve him a hot meal following a day's filming. An official report found that the 54-year-old presenter punched Mr Tymon in the mouth before being dragged away by a witness, causing the producer to go to A&E for emergency treatment. He also verbally abused him for 20 minutes, blaming Mr Tymon for failing to ensure that he could get a steak at the hotel. Victim: Oisin Tymon told police he did not wish to press charges against Mr Clarkson . Mr Clarkson was suspended as Top Gear presenter as soon as news of the fight came to light, and after the report was released the BBC announced that it would not renew his contract. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately, and the producer told North Yorkshire Police he did not want to see Mr Clarkson prosecuted. Despite his sacking, Mr Clarkson is set to take part in a series of Top Gear Live shows alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, although the performances will be rebranded. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to continue in some form, but Mr Hammond and Mr May are not expected to return. The star initially received widespread public support - including from his friend, Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the incident, while one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him. Trio: Mr Clarkson is still set to appear in Top Gear live shows alongside Richard Hammond and James May . But director-general

"Arsene Wenger has revealed that he was spat at whilst playing football in France - but that in those days he extracted his own revenge on the pitch. The Arsenal manager says that United defender Jonny Evans - who will be banned for the FA Cup quarter final against Arsenal on Monday - cannot expect any mercy in the modern age of global TV scrutiny. However, Wenger says the practice was more prevalent in former days when he played for RC Strasbourg in France, but that the lack of TV coverage meant it used to be less of an issue. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger reveals he was spat at while playing football in the French leagues . Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . Wenger said: 'Today the television makes it worse. I've been subject personally to spitting. Maybe my tackle was not good enough. At the time nobody spoke about it. 'When I played in France, it happened before but you didn't see it on television. When you see it on television it of course makes it worse. I was angry (when it happened) but I could control myself.' Asked whether spitting deserved a six-game ban, Wenger said: 'I applied the sentence myself. I don't know the rules well enough. It is rules. We have to respect the rules. They have to apply the rules. Evans and Papiss Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Manchester United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident . Cisse already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton’s Seamus Coleman in December. As a result, the Newcastle striker gets an additional one-match suspension after admitting his guilt, while Evans gets six. But Wenger insisted that the likes of Evans and Papiss Cisse have to accept that their actions will incur punishments now that all games are scrutinised by millions of viewers worldwide. 'We have to pay a price for that. We are popular. We are watched all over the world. It gives us some responsibility as well. When you do not live up to it, you have to pay for it. How much it (the punishment) is, I do not care but you cannot say: 'Ok, it's nothing' when you see in on television. When little boys are watching the game, if your boy says to you: 'Is that right?' You cannot say: 'Yes.' 'We have to accept that. There are cameras everywhere, that means we are spied on always basically, from morning until night, and that's a little bit less freedom to go over the line sometimes. 'It's good, it's good. You know it's like now the doping story that is coming out in cycling now. Even if it's 10 years later, 15 years later, people will be less inclined to do it today because they think: 'Oh, for the rest of my life that could come out, so I won't do it.'

"Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp is confident his side can overturn a 2-1 Champions League first leg deficit against Juventus on Wednesday due to their watertight defence. The improving Germans, who have recovered after a dismal first half to the domestic season that saw them anchored in last place as recently as last month in the Bundesliga, have kept a clean sheet in their last three league games, including a 0-0 draw against Cologne on the weekend. With Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels back fit in central defence, along with full backs Marcel Schmelzer and Lukasz Piszczek, Dortmund's defence has been as solid as it has been all season. Jurgen Klopp talks to his Dortmund players during a training session ahead of the second leg with Juventus .

The Dortmund squad are put through their paces in training ahead of the crucial game against Juventus . Aubameyang (left) talks with Reus (right) as the Dortmund pair limber up in training with some leg stretches . '(Against Cologne) we played another game without letting in a goal and that is something we can build on,' Klopp told reporters. 'We want to advance to the quarter-finals and we can do this.' Dortmund boast a fine record at home in Europe having won 11 of their last 14 Champions League games at the Westfalenstadion. But in order to book a spot in the last eight they have to snap a losing run at home against Juventus, having lost all three previous encounters against the Italians in Dortmund. Klopp will be counting on goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has scored five in his last seven outings and in-form Marco Reus, who has struck five times in eight games. Marco Reus cancelled out Carlos Tevez's opener before Alvaro Morata scored a 42nd-minute winner . Juventus are flying high in Serie A, edging closer to the Italian title with their first triumph away from home in over two months at Palermo, opening up a 14-point lead. 'One less win needed to win the league,' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said, knowing he will now need to shift his focus to Dortmund and their attacking game. 'We will need to take the lead there, maybe score more than one goal,' said the coach. They will, however, be without influential playmaker Andrea Pirlo who has yet to fully recover from a thigh injury suffered in the first leg. 'He has made good progress but not enough to be in Dortmund,' the club said in a statement. Klopp knows that his side will have to be at their absolute best to overcome high-flying Serie A giants Juve . Dortmund have won 11 of their last 14 home ties in the Champions League at the Westfalenstadion .

"(CNN)Are we alone in the cosmos? Or might there be intelligent life elsewhere? Last week, NASA scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two. This year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun, 51 Pegasi. Since then, ground-based surveys and NASA's Kepler satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed ""exoplanets,"" and thousands more candidates await confirmation. Many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system. Some have large planets like Jupiter that orbit their stars far closer than Mercury, the innermost planet in our solar system. But smaller rocky planets like Earth, though harder to find, appear to be even more abundant. Life on Earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed. That suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life. Life as we know it is carbon-based and requires liquid water. Astronomers define the ""habitable zone"" around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet's surface. Any closer to the star, the water will boil into vapor; any farther and the water freezes into ice. Extrapolating from discoveries to date, astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion Earth-like, habitable-zone planets in our Milky Way galaxy alone. Of course, there is a difference between single-celled organisms -- which developed 3.8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals, which appeared about 200 million years ago. And then the humans, who have existed for only 200,000 years. Intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on Earth. So while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen, the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse -- even assuming they evolved as humans did, with ears and spoken language, or eyes and written language -- is likely to be tiny. And life that can use radio waves has existed on Earth for only 0.000002% of the planet's history -- 100 years out of 4.5 billion. If the half dozen or so rocky, Earth-like exoplanets now known are similar, the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as, well, winning your state lottery with one ticket. Of course, if there are 40 billion Earth-like planets out there, the odds improve quite a bit. If they all have histories like the Earth's, there might be 1,000 planets in the Milky Way that could support communicative beings. But before you start composing your first letter to an alien, think about this: The chance that those beings evolved on exactly the same time scale is minuscule. Another planet's 100 years of brilliance might have occurred a billion years ago, or it might happen a billion years in the future. A lot depends on how long communication capabilities last.

"China's leadership has hit back at U.S. President Barack Obama who condemned the country for constructing an artificial island in the disputed South China Sea. Only yesterday, Obama claimed Beijing was 'using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions' amid reports of controversial land reclamation efforts. But a furious Chinese leadership has argued that it is Washington which possesses - and wields - the greatest military muscle. The war of words come as newly-released satellite images reveal a flotilla of Chinese vessels dredging sand onto artificially-built land masses near the Spratly Islands - an area which many other nations claim. War of words: China has criticised the United States over accusations it is bullying neighbouring countries by building artificial islands (pictured) on the so-called Mischief Reef in the disputed South China Sea . Untouched: Images from before China began its construction there (pictured in 2012) show no signs of tampering . Disputed: But newer images (pictured in March) show Chinese vessels dredging sand onto artificially-built land masses near the Spratly Islands . Territory: The area near the Spratly Islands where China is constructing artificial islands is claimed by many other countries in the region . Agressor: After the American president condemned China for building land masses on disputed territory, its furious leadership claimed it was Washington which possesses - and wields - the greatest military muscle . A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said: 'The US leader talked about China's 'sheer size and muscle', but one can also see clearly who has the biggest size and muscle in the world. Only hours before Obama's comments, Hua Chunying added that China has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly islands and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty', according to the BBC. She said the construction was to serve troops protecting the area, civilian activity such as search and rescue operations, scientific research and commercial fishing. 'The structures... do not affect, nor are they targeted at, any particular country,' she claimed before adding China would 'continue to strengthen' its activities in the area. The US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has has been picturing and documenting the construction of an artificial island known as Mischief Reef in the South China Sea. Massive expanses of sand and concrete were being unloaded among the Spratly Islands in the disputed waters. China used dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea before dumping it on submerged coral reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen, a geopolitical researcher in China claimed. Before-and-after images from the area show aircraft runways appearing from jungle, solid masses where there was once coral and man-made harbours replacing natural reefs. The country claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea. But the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all have overlapping claims to the region. Construction: The US Navy initially claimed China was creating a 'great wall of sand' (pictured in February 2014) in the South China Sea .

"She might be a new mother to twins but that didn't prevent a fresh-faced Charlene of Monaco from cutting a glamorous figure as she presented a sports prize this morning. Resplendent in an edgy navy leather jacket and a matching tailored dress, the 37-year-old was all smiles as she presented tennis ace Novak Djokovic with his Sportsman of the Year prize. The presentation of the award, which was bestowed on Djokovic by the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, came during the Laureus World Sports Awards. Scroll down for video . Princess with prizes: Charlene allows herself a chuckle as she hands the award to Novak Djokovic . Although the main ceremony took place in Shanghai, Charlene's star turn took place in Monte Carlo instead, with the moment projected onto big screens in front of a glitzy audience of actors and sports stars. Among the big names celebrating with Djokovic, albeit from a distance, were actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Henry Cavill and model Karolina Kurkova. While Cumberbatch, who was hosting the main event, and 31-year-old Cavill have no clear links to sport, Charlene's own sporting pedigree is impeccable. A successful swimmer, she burst onto the scene in 1999 at the All Africa Games in Johannesburg where she picked up three golds and a silver for her native South Africa. Glamorous gathering: The 37-year-old royal cut an elegant figure during the presentation ceremony . Sporting pedigree: Charlene has an impressive sporting pedigree of her own and was an Olympic swimmer . Chuffed: Mr Djokovic looked suitably thrilled with his Sportsman of the Year award . She went on to compete in the 2000 Olympics but narrowly missed out on the 2008 event after spending 18 months out with shoulder injury. Since marrying Monaco's Prince Albert in July 2011, she has used her position to promote a number of sporting initiatives via the Princess Charlene Foundation. Of these, the best known is a programme that encourages children to learn to swim, while emphasising water safety. Today's outing, for the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, dovetails with her own charitable ambitions and promotes excellence in sport, as well as positive social change. Now a mother to four-month-old twins Gabriella Thérèse Marie and Jacques Honoré Rainier, Charlene is attending fewer engagements than previously but remains a familiar sight at sporting events. Surprise guests: Mr Cavill and Mr Cumberbatch chat while showing their support for the sporting event . Roles: Mr Cavill's new film Superman vs. Batman isn't far off, while Mr Cumberbatch is prepping for Hamlet . Adding some glamour: Model Karolina Kurkova and Paralympic cycling star Sarah Storey .

"Wigan chairman David Sharpe is adamant the decision to axe Malky Mackay in favour of rookie boss Gary Caldwell less than 24 hours later was the right call. Struggling Latics moved on to their third manager of the season on Tuesday as former club captain Caldwell was swiftly appointed in a permanent capacity after Mackay's disastrous five-month tenure had ended the previous day. Mackay left the club languishing in the Sky Bet Championship relegation zone after taking just 19 points from a possible 72 and Caldwell, who at 32 is the Football League's youngest manager, inherits a team eight points adrift of safety with just five games to go. Gary Caldwell has been officially unveiled as the new Wigan Athletic manager at the DW Stadium . Wigan chairman David Sharpe is confident he has made the right appointment in Caldwell . Gary Caldwell (Wigan) 32 . Adam Murray (Mansfield) 33 . Alex Neil (Norwich City) 33 . Lee Johnson (Barnsley) 33 . Karl Robinson (MK Dons) 34 . But rather than making an interim appointment until the end of the season, Sharpe made the bold call to hand Caldwell a rolling contract which will see him in charge at the DW Stadium next season, regardless of what division they are in. 'That shows how much I believe in Gary,' the 23-year-old Sharpe said. 'It's definitely not just for the next five games, he's got a free hit at it really. If he keeps us up it's a miracle and if we go down it's expected by everybody in this room but Gary will back himself to keep us up. 'This is a long-term thing and we're looking forward to the future with him that gets us back to our identity on and off the pitch and bring the positive times back to this football club.' The good times seem an increasingly distant memory for Wigan, who have had unsuccessful stints with Owen Coyle, Uwe Rosler and Mackay at the helm after winning the FA Cup under Roberto Martinez two years ago.

'I've known with my grandad, he's got a reputation for making decisive decisions and I've learned from the best,' said Sharpe. 'It had to be done and I'm looking forward to the future.

"Chelsea have made an offer for FC Tokyo's 22-year-old forward Yoshinori Muto, according to club president Naoki Ogane. The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the £200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March . FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto . Muto tussles with Yuji Nakazawa of Yokohama F.Marinos during a J-League clash last month . Age: 22 . Club: FC Tokyo . Appearances: 37 . Goals: 16 . International caps (Japan): 11 . International goals: 1 . Did you know? Muto graduated from Keio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago . Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London. He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue. A £4million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club . Muto, pictured in action against Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season . The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year . He has continued his fine form during the current campaign, helping his club to third place in the division with three goals in four games.

The initial five-year deal is the biggest in the club's history, with the Blues now considering a two-week pre-season tour of Japan this summer.

"Patrick Bamford wants to lead the line for Chelsea in the Premier League – but before then he could be leading Middlesbrough to the top-flight after inspiring this vital victory over Wolves. Boro boss Aitor Karanka said before the game that his team had to win all four of their remaining matches to finish in the top two of a claustrophobic Championship. And thanks to Blues loanee Bamford – creator of one for Jelle Vossen and scorer of the other - the Teessiders remain on course for what would be a deserved return to the top division. Patrick Bamford (second right) scored Middlesbrough's second goal as they beat Wolves on Tuesday night . Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1): Konstantopoulos; Kalas, Woodgate (Omeruo 62), Gibson, Friend; Clayton, Forshaw; Adomah (Amorebieta 80), Tomlin, Bamford; Vossen (Nsue 74). Subs not used: Ripley, Whitehead, Ledesma, Kike. Booked: Clayton. Goals: Vossen 3, Bamford 11. Wolverhampton (4-4-1-1): Ikeme; Iorfa, Batth, Stearman, Hause (Golbourne 45); Van La Parra (Jacobs 77), McDonald, Price (Dicko 63), Sako; Edwards; Afobe. Subs not used: Kuszczak, Henry, Doyle, Ebanks-Landell. Booked: Stearman, Batth, Sako, Edwards. Goal: Sako 63. Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire). Attendance: 20,520. Man of the Match: Patrick Bamford. Boro were relegated in 2009 and even the play-offs have been beyond them in the years since. This maximum at least guaranteed post-season participation, but they will want to avoid that scenario. And with the likes of Bamford in this kind of form they have every chance of going up automatically. Friday’s trip to Norwich, however, will go a long way to determining their fate in that respect. Karanka said: ‘We want more than the play-offs and the players showed that here. They were amazing in the first half. But this game demanded a lot of us mentally. We have to be ready for Norwich now, it is another huge game.’ Bamford, with 17, has now scored more league goals in one season than any other Boro player has achieved in the last 25 years. The 21-year-old makes no secret of his desire to one day return to Chelsea and challenge for a starting jersey. Karanka, though, could well be using his friendship with Jose Mourinho to secure another loan stay should they join the West Londoners in the Premier League. ‘For me, he is the best young player in the league. He is scoring goals and is showing he is mature, not just on the pitch but also in the changing-room,’ added the former Real Madrid assistant. Boro were good value for this win – Wolves boss Kenny Jackett called them ‘ruthless’ - and they were ahead inside three minutes. Adam Clayton loaded a ball forward from deep and Bamford gave chase. His presence was enough to unsettle dithering centre-back Richard Stearman and the forward stole in before squaring for the unmarked Vossen who rolled home for his eighth of the season. Bamford celebrates with Jelle Vossen after he teed up the Belgian for Boro's early opener . The goal owed everything to Bamford’s endeavour and he soon had one of his own on 11 minutes. Albert

"Father-of-four Imran Sharif admitted brutally murdered his wife of 17 years in their kitchen before calmly heading off to work . A father-of-four brutally murdered his wife of 17 years in their kitchen before calmly heading off to work, a court heard. Pharmacist Imran Sharif had dropped the couple's children at their schools before going home and slitting his wife Raheela Imran's throat. Leaving her dead on the kitchen floor, the 'violent and dangerous' 44-year-old changed out of his bloodstained clothes and hid them under the driver's seat of his car. He then stashed the murder weapon - which was never found - and went to work. Paramedics were called to the end-of-terrace home in Hillersdon, Slough on the afternoon of October 20 after Raheela's brother made the gruesome discovery of her body. He had gone round to the house after family members became concerned and found the front door ajar. A post mortem examination found the mother-of-four died as a result of a wound to the neck. Sharif was arrested later that day before being charged with murder on October 23. He had originally denied killing his 45-year-old spouse, but later confessed to a friend and fellow prisoner while he was being held in custody at HMP Bullingdon. Detective Chief Inspector Mike Lynch said: 'I am glad that Sharif has accepted responsibility for what he did and admitted that he took his wife's life. 'This has been an incredibly difficult time for Raheela's family and friends as they try to come to terms with their loss and although it may offer them little comfort, I hope that Sharif's guilty plea will be of some help as they begin to rebuild their family's lives.' Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, said Raheela's life had been 'brought to a premature end.' Raheela Imran's body was removed from her home in Slough after husband Sharif slit her throat last October . Forensic technologists had investigated at the semi-detached house where Mrs Imran lived with Sharif and their four children . Mr Foster said: 'Having been charged with his wife's murder and while on remand at Bullingdon Prison, Sharif confided in another prisoner, who he had known for about 12 years and admitted killing his wife. 'He is clearly an extremely violent and dangerous man. 'This case represents a tragedy for the family of Raheela. Her children, family and friends have been devastated by her untimely death. 'We have worked closely with Thames Valley Police since this investigation was launched and as a result of the hard work and diligence of the prosecution team, a just outcome has been achieved. A post mortem examination found the mother-of-four died as a result of a wound to the neck . Forensic officers leave the Sharifs' house in Slough where Mrs Imran was found stabbed to death . 'We know that nothing will bring Raheela back to her children, family and friends, but we hope that today's conviction brings them at least a small sense that justice has been done. Our thoughts

The 59-year-old had photographed some of the biggest stories of the 20th Century (from Princess Diana’s pregnancy to Mick Jagger’s relationship with Jerry Hall), but when Hurricane Sandy struck New York in October 2012, flooding Taylor’s entire storage facility, almost all of his work was destroyed.

He said: 'Alcohol kills mold so I came up with this process to literally dip the pictures in alcohol and immediately kill it off. 'It also froze the image at that moment in time. It was like taking a snapshot of the picture in that damaged state. Taylor said the entire experience has 'been a roller coaster of emotions.' ‘[It] started off as a sense of total loss and devastation. But ultimately this has been a wonderful experience; a lot of great art came out of it and I'm happy with what was saved.' Taylor, from New York, USA, has enjoyed an amazing career that has seen him cover some of the most dramatic events of the 20th and early 21st Century.

It is the first time he has flown the nest and I expect to see him develop. Kimi was fantastic at races in 2013 but at the same events last year he was nowhere. The car will be better and I hope it gives him what he needs. Sebastian Vettel has moved from Red Bull to Ferrari for the 2015 season . McLaren . Engine: Honda . 14 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Age: 33 .

"These adorable abandoned badger cubs have been nursed back to health by a kind-hearted animal lover on a diet of custard creams. The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried away in a Jack Russell's mouth - are doing better than ever after they were taken in by retired farmer Pauline Kidner. Nursed originally on milk form bottles custard creams were introduced into their diet slowly to see whether the cubs were ready for food. Scroll down for video . The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried by a dog - are doing better . Nursed originally on milk, custard creams were introduced to see whether the cubs were ready for food . 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe,' Pauline said . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at the Secret World centre, but Pauline, who runs charity Secret World, says they're growing at an astonishing rate. The 65-year-old, from Somerset, said: 'When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g, now they're 1.1kg, you can almost see them growing.' 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe, we can't risk any getting in their lungs, but they're now on normal bottles. 'Little Star came from Derbyshire, she was brought into someone's kitchen by their Jack Russell dog, it was very lucky he didn't hurt her, she'd been born two days earlier; her umbilical was still attached . 'The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so unfortunately it died within 24 hours . Pauline explained to have two badger cubs picked up by dogs in a short space of time is unusual. 'One cub a year is brought in when dogs get down in the set,' she said. The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so it died within 24 hours . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at centre . Jack Russels have an instinct for digging and going down holes and are traditionally used in badger baiting. However, there is no reason to suspect the illegal blood-sport was to blame for the death of this cub. 'Then we had another called Vogue come up from Cornwall, we called her that because was picked up in the village Vogue near Redruth,' Pauline said.

"As Andy Murray and Kim Sears prepare for their nuptials in his home town of Dunblane on Saturday, the local residents are also getting ready for the big day. The inhabitants of the Scottish cathedral town have gone into overdrive for wedding of their most famous resident, lining the streets with bunting and creating special-themed produce in many of the stories. Since the Wimbledon champion announced his plans to say 'I do' at the cathedral, there have also been plans to line the streets with well-wishers as the couple make their way to the venue.

"Jerusalem (CNN)A Palestinian teenager's name will be removed from an Israeli memorial commemorating fallen soldiers and the victims of terrorism after his family and others complained. Mohammed Abu Khdeir's name appeared this week on the wall at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl, the site of the national cemetery, as the nation prepared to mark its Memorial Day on Wednesday. Abu Khdeir, 16, was beaten and burned alive by three Israelis in July, according to prosecutors. A picture on the memorial website for Abu Khdeir shows an Israeli flag with two flowers called ""Blood of the Maccabees"" in Israel, a symbol often used on Memorial Day, when the country honors its soldiers killed in the line of duty and victims of terrorism. But Abu Khdeir's family objected to his inclusion on the memorial wall. His father, Hussein Abu Khdeir, said no one asked for his permission to put his son's name on the wall. ""I refuse that my son's name will be listed between soldiers of the occupation,"" he said. Almagor, an organization that works on behalf of victims of terror in Israel, also opposes Abu Khdeir's inclusion on the memorial. Almagor described the teen's death as a rogue attack and said he's not a terror victim. ""Somebody did here a trick, and we are going to fight to correct it,"" said Almagor CEO Meir Indor. ""We will not recognize someone who was murdered in a brutal way in an individual action."" Indor's organization wrote a letter to the National Insurance Institute of Israel -- the country's social security administration, which maintains the memorial site -- demanding that Abu Khdeir's name be removed from the memorial wall. Indor said if the teenager's name is not taken off, members of Almagor want their own family members' names removed. On Wednesday, Israel Radio reported that the National Insurance Institute of Israel will remove Abu Khdeir's name from the memorial following his father's complaints. The teen's name has already been removed from the organization's website, which lists the names on the memorial wall. A panel of judges began hearing evidence in January against the three suspects in Abu Khdeir's killing.

"A war of words appears to have erupted between two former rival stations who last week merged newsrooms. An account purporting to be Sydney radio station 2UE sent out a tweet on Thursday morning which appears to have come from a disgruntled former employee. 'Apologies for the s*** news service these days,' the tweet began. 'We hope you like the sound of whinging hyenas reading the news. #bringbackblanda', the post ended. What looks to a tweet from a disgruntled former radio employee emerged on Twitter on Thursday morning . The hashtag was in reference to the station's former newsreader Steve Blanda, who had read the news at 2UE for over a decade. While the tweet has since been removed from the @2UENews Twitter account, there is speculation online that it could have been sent by an employee displaced by the controversial merger. A 2UE spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they were aware of the posting but denied the message came from one of their accounts. They said it had not been used in years, and they believe it had been hacked, but by who they said they were unsure. Last Thursday the 90-year-old radio station 2UE broadcast its last ever bulletin out of the Sydney office, following a merger with rival station 2GB. Jobs were lost out of the Brisbane 4BC office, and at Magic 1278 IS Brisbane. 2UE in Sydney has just merged with rival station 2GB, which meant job losses from the newsroom and additional redundancies nationally . A 2UE spokesman said the new combined newsroom will be staffed by more than 20 journalists from both stations. Reporter Robert Spicer filed a brief story about the history of the station, which has covered every major news story for the most part of the last century including former prime minister Gough Whitlam's dismissal, the Beaconsfield mine disaster and the recent Sydney siege. '2UE has covered every significant news event over the past 90 years, with some of the best journalists in the country,' he said. Jason Morrison, a former 2UE breakfast and drive broadcaster, said the station took a financial hit after letting controversial ratings winner Alan Jones defect to 2GB in 2002. '2UE made some terrible decisions - whoever could let Alan Jones leave 2UE?,' he told AAP. 'That was the death knell, really, for the station.' Instead of local presenters in Sydney and Brisbane Alan Jones' (right) show will be broadcast in the breakfast slot, while Ray Hadley (left) will present mornings - both from their 2GB programs . Morrison, who is now spokesman for billionaire mining magnate Gina Rinehart, said it is a shame the longstanding 2UE-2GB rivalry was now over. 'When there is competition, there will be that desire to ensure that no stone's left unturned and there will be that desire to make sure that all angles are covered.' The 2UE spokesman said redundancies from the creation of the single newsroom in Sydney were regrettable but the right commercial decision for the broadcaster. The merger also saw changes at the Brisbane 4BC station, with a

"Two years after his death, a remarkable twist of fate has meant a loving Navy father's message has finally reached his 10-year-old son. Joseph Torrez passed away two years ago, aged 41, after succumbing to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an incurable neurological disorder. The rapidly-progressing terminal illness eats away at the brain - causing dementia, memory loss, anxiety and psychosis - and affects motor skills and physical movements. Rowan Torrez, now 10, received the postcard (pictured) in the mail at the weekend, almost exactly two years after his father's death . Rowan and his father Joseph play together when he was a toddler. The young boy was his father's pride and joy, his mother Julie Van Stone said . Rowan (pictured) said he remembers his father as a 'very good person' Prior to the onset of the deadly disease, he moved away from his son Rowan, 10, to Boston, to gain two Masters degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 9News reported. And while studying or travelling home, he sent countless postcards to his only son reminding him how much he missed him. Now, just days away from the two-year anniversary of his death, his son Rowan has received an incredible gift in the mail. It was a postcard, dated June 10, 2007, which read: 'Hello from Pennsylvania. I love you, and I miss you so much. See you soon. Love, Daddy.' It was a touching moment for Rowan, who remembers his father as a 'very good person' and a good father and, as he told the broadcaster, a fitting final goodbye.

"An Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto was forced to divert to Shannon Airport in Ireland last night after an 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board. The pensioner, who was travelling in First Class on board the Boeing 777-300 jet, was allegedly restrained by cabin crew until the plane was forced into the unplanned landing. The flight crew alerted the pilot, who put a call in to the Irish Aviation Authority’s (IAA) North Atlantic Communications Service centre at Ballygirreen in Co Clare, who advised to land at Shannon. An 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board an Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto that forced a diversion to Shannon Airport . On touching down at around 8.15pm local time, Gardaí­ and airport police officers were standing by, and the woman was taken into custody. MailOnline Travel have been advised by Irish police that the woman has since been released without charge, and she will be undergoing a 'fit-to-fly- screening in the hope of continuing her journey. There is no indication from the police as to the actions of the woman on board at this time. The decision was taken to divert when the Air Canada flight ACA-877 was around 600 miles north west of Shannon, and the plane, carrying 211 passengers, turned around. The Irish Times report that 'airport emergency services were standing by at strategic locations along the runway so that they could follow the aircraft once it had landed.' On touching down at Shannon Airport, the elderly woman was met by Irish police and taken into custody . As expected with unscheduled landings, the plane was forced to dump fuel in advance of the descent over the Atlantic. A spokesperson for Air Canada told MailOnline Travel: 'Our flight, AC877 on Friday, April 10, Frankfurt to Toronto, diverted to Shannon due to a disruptive passenger, who was removed from the aircraft. 'It was a B777 with 211 passengers. It subsequently departed and completed its journey.'

"Nathan Hines has little interest in any Aviva Premiership points target as Sale Sharks continue their quest to secure European Champions Cup qualification. Sale are currently seventh in the Premiership table - one place off sealing a guaranteed Champions Cup place next term - with five games left. Sharks' final phase of the domestic campaign begins against visitors Gloucester on Sunday, while further appointments await with London Irish, Harlequins, Newcastle and Exeter. Nathan Hines has little interest in any points target as Sale continue European qualification quest . And while Sale realistically cannot afford any slip-ups during the season's closing stages, Sharks' former Scotland lock Hines is not looking beyond tackling Gloucester. 'I don't know what will get us into the top six,' he said. 'All I know is we want to win every game. If we are thinking about how many games we need to win, that will be our undoing. 'We are just thinking about Gloucester, win that one, chalk that one up and then move on to the next. That is the best and most efficient way to look at it, really. Fly half Danny Cipriani set for Sale Sharks return after England international duty . 'I know it's a cliche to say one game at a time, but if you start spreading your focus around too many things, you will come unstuck. 'It's about making sure not to worry if we win and someone else loses. It's more about worrying about our own performance as a team and as individuals. It's about getting our own stuff right.' England international Danny Cipriani is back in Sale's number 10 shirt on Sunday, while on-loan centre Brendan Macken makes his first start for Gloucester, featuring alongside England's Billy Twelvetrees in midfield.

"The mother of murdered British student Meredith Kercher is 'surprised and very shocked' by an Italian court's decision to overturn the convictions of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito. The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation, which was announced late last night, is the final ruling in the case, ending the long legal battle waged by Ms Knox and her ex-boyfriend. Ms Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy. Arline Kercher said she was 'surprised and very shocked' at the Italian court's decision. Here she is pictured during a press conference in Perugia, Italy, following Knox and Sollecito's original convictions in 2009 . Knox and Sollecito were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively before their convictions were overturned. Arline Kercher, Meredith's mother, said she had heard little more about the decision other than the verdict. She said: 'I am a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is about it at the moment. They have been convicted twice, so it's a bit odd that it should change now.' Asked whether she had any plans following the ruling, she said: 'I really don't know at the moment, I haven't got any plans. 'I can't see how evidence that was once deemed evidence is now no longer thought to be evidence. I am still shocked.' Talking about the Italian legal system she said: 'It is a long drawn out process.' She then added: 'If you write anything, never forget Meredith.' Meredith's father John declined to comment this evening. Ms Kercher (pictured left and right) was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 . Following Knox and Sollecito's original conviction, the two served four years in prison before a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years. Now Italy's highest court in Rome has overturned the second convictions and declined to order another trial. Both Knox, who was awaiting the verdict in her home town of Seattle, and Sollecito have long maintained their innocence.

"Rory McIlroy believes it is 'unthinkable' that he will not win the Masters at some point to complete the career grand slam. And the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at Augusta National in 2011 was the most important day of his career. McIlroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Rory McIlroy tees off at the Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament in Orlando on March 19 . 'For me now it's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved,' the 25-year-old said in an interview with BBC Northern Ireland. 'There's something special I can achieve going into Augusta this year. You are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses, different tests, different conditions. Not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome. It would just be incredible. 'You feel the sense of what can be achieved but I can't think about that too much. I just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as I can and if I can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else's.' McIlroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six Masters appearances, finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round. McIlroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at Augusta later this month . But the 25-year-old cannot picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket. 'During my career, yes it's unthinkable,' he added. 'If I don't win it this year...either it's not the right time or it isn't your time. If I was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket I'd obviously be very, very disappointed. 'And not just one. I feel like it's a course I can do very well at and a golf course I can hopefully win multiple times on. Obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others.' McIlroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago, only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner Charl Schwartzel. But he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the US Open two months later, before adding wins in the 2012 US PGA and both the Open and US PGA last year. McIlroy is hoping to emulate the likes of Jack Nicklaus (above) by winning all four major titles . 'I think it was the most important day of my career,' he added.

"Your wedding is fast approaching and, as a last hurrah, you decide to celebrate in the most extravagant way possible - with a trip to ‘Space Vegas'. Here even a 'poor space miner can maybe strike it lucky at the zero-g roulette tables'. That’s the fantastic future imagined by one artist, whose awe-inspiring drawings of a next-generation space station in orbit reveal what space travel may one day look like. Taking one of several imaginative space planes, in this future timeline you’ll be partying to your heart’s content in an orbital extravaganza. Concept artist Alex Brady from Cambridge has created beautiful pictures of what space travel might look like. He imagines a space station of tomorrow similar to Las Vegas (shown in image), with neon lights and plenty of attractions . The images were created by concept artist Alex Brady, 32, from Cambridge in the UK, who normally works on video games and movies. But for these drawings he decided to try his hand at imagining what the future of space travel might look like. A space settlement would be a large structure, comparable in size to a town or small city, built in Earth orbit. It would have similar amenities and services to towns and cities on Earth, and would enable people to live in space. The ISS currently houses six astronauts at a time, but a space settlement would have hundreds or thousands of people on board. Future space settlements may also have artificial gravity by rotating around an axis. ‘It’s inspired by super yachts docking at the casino marinas in Monaco, as well as Macao and of course Las Vegas,’ he told MailOnline. ‘I liked the kind of trashy, flashy future in movies like The Fifth Element. ‘They’re absolutely preposterous but also cheerful and dynamic and irreverent.’ In the main image of Space Vegas, a fantastic array of colours and attractiosn can be seen, including a Ferris wheel and a lit-up cowboy. Several spacecraft docked at the space station can also be seen, based on similar designs for space planes. It is located in orbit around Earth, allowing planes to seemingly take off from Earth and then return to the planet with relative ease. The cone-shaped space station is also shown in a state of partial completion, with space planes again making the journey from the ground. ‘It’s inspired by super yachts docking at the casino marinas in Monaco, as well as Macao and of course Las Vegas [pictured],’ artist Alex Brady, 32, told MailOnline. ‘I liked the kind of trashy, flashy future in movies like The Fifth Element' The station is located in orbit around Earth, allowing planes to seemingly take off from Earth and then return to the planet with relative ease .

"A young Syrian boy has revealed how he saw depraved Islamic State militants playing football with a severed head inside the besieged Yarmouk refugee camp. Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he stumbled on the barbaric scene shortly after the terrorists beat him unconscious when they burst into his family home at the camp in the Syrian capital Damascus. The schoolboy said the ISIS fighters were looking for his brother, who is a member of the Palestinian rebel group who ran and defended the camp for several years before ISIS carried out a bloody assault that has left more than 200 people dead in just seven days. His story was revealed as refugees in Yarmouk spoke of the daily atrocities they have witnessed since ISIS seized control of 90 per cent of the camp, including innocent children being slaughtered in front of their anguished parents. Scroll down for video . Scene of death: A destroyed graveyard is photographed in Yarmouk camp following the intense fighting . Innocent: Palestinians, who fled the Yarmouk refugee camp, sit on mattresses inside a school in Damascus . After enduring two years of famine and fighting, Ibrahim Abdel Fatah said he saw heads cut off by ISIS in the Palestinian camp of Yarmouk. That was it. He fled and hasn't looked back. Unshaven, pale and gaunt, he has found refuge with his wife and seven children at the Zeinab al-Haliyeh school in Tadamun, a southeastern district of the Syrian capital held by the army. 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised,' he said. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved,' the 55-year-old said. The school is currently home to 98 displaced people, among them 40 children, who have been put up in three classrooms. The usual occupants, schoolchildren, have been evacuated temporarily from rooms where mattresses and bedding now blanket the floor. 'I left my house which was the only thing I had. My family lived on rations supplied by UNRWA,' the United Nations agency that looks after Palestinian refugees, the former caretaker said. Destroyed: In late December 2012, Yarmouk - just four miles from central Damascus - became a battlefield between pro- and anti-government forces before a merciless siege began . A man stands on a staircase inside a demolished building inside the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp . Anwar Abdel Hadi, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official in Damascus, said 500 families, or about 2,500 people, fled Yarmouk before IS fighters attacked the camp last Wednesday. Before the assault, there were around 18,000 people in Yarmouk in a southern neighbourhood of the Syrian capital. Yarmouk was once a thriving district housing 160,000 Palestinian refugees and Syrians. But that was before it too was caught up in the widespread civil unrest which erupted in 2011. In late December 2012, Yarmouk - just four miles from central Damascus - became a battlefield between pro- and anti-government forces before a merciless siege began. The camp has been encircled

"Dustin Klopp hanged himself in his cell at Lancaster County Prison in Pennsylvania on Wednesday . A Pennsylvania man accused of killing his wife with an ax on Christmas Eve and sexually assaulting her was pronounced dead after a suicide attempt. Dustin Lee Klopp, 36, hanged himself in his cell at Lancaster County Prison on Wednesday night. The Paradise Township man was brought to the hospital and declared brain-dead because of lack of oxygen to the brain, according to the Lancaster County coroner's office. Klopp was pronounced dead Friday. Authorities believe Klopp killed his wife, Stephanie Kilhefner, 34, at their home after an argument. They had been married for three years. It is believed he cut her throat with a knife and repeatedly hit her in the head with an ax. When Kilhefner was dead, Klopp put her body in a bag in a shed and tried to clean up the blood. He brought their children, aged five and two, to celebrate the holiday with his parents and then called police to confess. After placing the call, Klopp arrived at the state police barracks in Lancaster about an hour later. Police believe he sexually assaulted his wife during the incident, although it is not clear if she was alive or dead at the time. Klopp was charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and evidence-tampering. The children did not see what happened, Lancaster Online reported. Police say Klopp, 36 (left) murdered his wife of three years, Stephanie Kilhefner, 34, (right) on Christmas Eve . The killing happened at the Lancaster home (left) Klopp and Kilhefner (right) shared with their two children . Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman called the situation 'awful' and 'chilling', the Huffington Post reported. He said: 'The timing makes it worse. 'Then you put kids in the mix and it makes it even more difficult. 'Christmas for them is ruined forever. It's just terrible.' In 2009 Klopp was arrested on drug charges and served time before being released in 2011 and marrying Kilhefner. Klopp's criminal record also included guilty pleas for DUI, resisting arrest, burglary and simple assault.

"Cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to Daily Mail readers . She was turned down for life-changing surgery on the NHS. But cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to Daily Mail readers. The three-year-old was denied NHS funding last year for the surgery at the same Leeds hospital trust which gave aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham breast enlargements. And even when readers raised £55,000 to pay for Sophie’s surgery her family were told by NHS doctors she was ‘not disabled enough’ to qualify – despite not being able to walk. But the toddler has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon Dr Tae Park in the United States this autumn. It means that, by the time she is four, Sophie could be walking. Sophie was born prematurely with spastic diplegia – a form of cerebral palsy. She needs the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery, which involves cutting the nerves in her spine, to be able to walk freely. Sophie has strengthened her legs ahead of the operation using a specially-adapted £1,200 bicycle bought from readers’ donations. Doctors said this means she is an ‘ideal candidate’ for the surgery and is likely to be able to walk completely unaided afterwards. Sophie’s mother Allison, 41, a nurse, said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved. She said: ‘Sophie wiped my face and she said “Mummy why are you crying?” I told her she was going to be able to walk and she said “Yes!”. ‘By the time she is four she could be walking. It’s very, very emotional, we just can’t believe it. ‘It is frustrating that Leeds turned us down but now we know that Sophie is going to have the best surgeon, so that is more reassuring. If anything goes wrong at least we know we did everything we could for her. ‘As it gets nearer I’m sure the nerves will kick in - it’s a big operation. But it’s what she needs and it’s the best thing for her. ‘Sophie understands now that she is going to walk. She knows Dr Park will “fix her legs” and she knows she is going on a big plane to get there.’ The three-year-old was denied NHS funding last year for the surgery, but she has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon Dr Tae Park in the U.S. Sophie’s mother Allison, 41, a nurse, said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved. She said: ‘If it wasn’t for the Daily Mail we wouldn’t be where we are now' Mrs Thomlinson said Sophie had progressed to standing up on her own since using the bike bought from readers’ funds, which meant doctors had told her they were ‘confident’ she would be able to walk after surgery. She added: ‘If it wasn’t for the Daily Mail we wouldn’t be where

"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (above) said Britain would become the first country in the world with a nationwide meningitis B vaccination programme after the Government reached a deal with drug maker GlaxoSmithKline . All babies will be offered an injection against deadly meningitis B – ending a year-long delay, the Health Secretary said yesterday. The vaccine costs £20 a time and is expected to be available on the NHS by the end of the year. Jeremy Hunt’s announcement follows growing pressure from charities, highlighted by the Mail, which warned that children were dying and suffering devastating injuries while wrangling about the cost continued. There are around 1,870 cases of meningitis B in the country each year and it commonly affects the under-fives and teenagers. It leads to around 120 deaths and leaves another 400 with life-long disabilities including brain damage, amputations and blindness. A panel of scientific advisers had recommended in October 2013 that the vaccine should not be introduced as it was not deemed cost-effective. But ministers told the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation to carry out another assessment and this concluded last March that it should be offered. The Government then spent almost a year negotiating with drugs manufacturers trying to agree a cheaper price. On Saturday, the Mail highlighted how the jab was being denied to babies because of the cost row. Nearly 800,000 babies each year would be eligible for the jab at an average annual cost of £16million. Charities estimate the NHS would spend around £3million treating and caring for just one child who has survived meningitis but is left with life-long disabilities. GPs would give the injection to babies from the age of two months, with boosters at four months and 12 months. In most cases, they would have it with the five-in-one jab and the rotavirus oral vaccination. The move means the UK will be the first country in the world to offer the vaccine to all babies. Mr Hunt said: ‘We can go ahead this year with rolling out the meningitis B vaccine and that’s something families, particularly those with young children, will really welcome.’ Children need three doses in the first year of life, making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in England and Wales £42million. GPs are also paid a £7.50 fee for each dose administered . Meningitis B can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms. The disease is an infection of the meninges - the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities. The first symptoms usually include fever, vomiting and headaches. Others include limb pain, pale skin, neck stiffness, dislike of bright lights and confusion. It is commonly found in children under five years of age but can also affect teenagers aged 15 to 19. It is fatal in around 10 per cent of cases. Some of those who survive are left with long-term problems, such as amputation,

"Voters are still 'in the dark' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day, economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on £30billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra £26billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly £3 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was £87.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from £98.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of £90.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than £60 billion from £153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of £1.48 trillion is more than £500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of £956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya

"Bangkok (CNN)Thailand has lifted martial law, replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta. Critics have expressed alarm at the move, with Human Rights Watch's Asia director Brad Adams saying it marked the country's ""deepening descent into dictatorship."" Martial law was lifted Wednesday when the Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved a request from Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha to proceed. Prayuth -- head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) junta -- immediately invoked Article 44 of the country's interim constitution ""to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability."" Article 44 states, in wide-ranging terms, that when the head of the junta believes it is necessary in the name of public harmony or to prevent the undermining of national security, then he has the power to act as deemed necessary. According to a statement issued by the NCPO, the new order grants military personnel powers to issue summons and arrest those who commit crimes against the royal family or against national stability, who commit crimes involving war weaponry, or who violate the orders of the NCPO. Designated military personnel were granted powers to seize assets, to block media from reporting or publishing, and to detain suspects up to seven days, the statement said. Unauthorized political gatherings of more than five people were banned, while those who defied NCPO orders could be imprisoned for up to a year, it said. Those who were detained could not leave the country without the approval of the head of the NCPO. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the new security order would allow Prayuth ""to issue orders without administrative, legislative, or judicial oversight or accountability."" ""Thailand's friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand by the junta leader to replace martial law with a constitutional provision that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers,"" Adams said in a statement. Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher on Thailand, told CNN the move would see Prayuth ""become a strongman with ultimate power in his hands to wield as he wishes."" ""This is a dangerous indication that the junta is not going to keep its promise to restore democracy and respect for human rights in Thailand,"" he said. Rupert Abbott, deputy director for Asia Pacific at Amnesty International, called in a statement for the NCPO to ""reinstate the rule of law and constitutional protections for human rights which the 2014 coup steamrolled over."" Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed alarm at the news. ""Normally I would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in Thailand,"" the High Commissioner said. ""But I am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian, which bestows unlimited powers on the current Prime Minister without any judicial oversight at all. This clearly leaves the door wide open to serious violations of fundamental human rights."" Martial law was imposed shortly before Thailand's military

"It isn't often Paris Saint-Germain are compared to Shrewsbury Town, but that is exactly what Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho did when accusing the French side of 'aggressive tactics'.

"(CNN)It was nothing if not predictable. Take combustible issues like religion and sexuality, stir in a new law and talk of a boycott, then -- boom! -- the debate on social media explodes. And so it has proved with Indiana's new ""religious freedom"" law, signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose. Opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty. The debate is nothing if not vitriolic. And colorful, too. ""Libs SHUTUP,"" reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's ""Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)"" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. People on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and, it seems for the moment, more numerous. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. Others say that Indiana seems out of step with modern times. And then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that, law or no law, they have no intention of turning anyone away. ""My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct,"" tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce. ""We stand against discrimination."" And a tweet from a the St. Elmo Steak House, a business in Indianapolis, the state's capital and its largest city, pledged in capital letters to continue serving ALL. The word Freedom should only be used when it's inclusive and fair for all. Supporters of the law, however, made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott. ""Before you go and get too self-righteous w/ your #BoycottIndiana,"" a user called Caleb Parke tweeted, ""@GovPenceIN is protecting #religiousfreedom for EVERYONE! #EqualRights.""

"Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United team-mate Marouane Fellaini has gone from Old Trafford scapegoat to one of the most dangerous forwards in Europe. Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option. 'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player. Wayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment . Fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool . Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope. 'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney. 'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in. 'We have been

"The family of a four-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted and murdered more than 75 years ago have accused police of a 'cover-up' after officers ordered that the case file be kept secret until 2040. Joyce Cox was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in Cardiff on September 28, 1939. The schoolgirl had been walking with her older brother Dennis, who was seven at the time, but she disappeared when he lost sight of her. Her body was found dumped by a railway station but police have never caught her killer. Now, Terry Phillips, 71, who is Joyce's cousin, has accused the Metropolitan Police of a 'cover-up' after the force said information could not be released about her murder because it is unfair to the mystery suspect. Joyce Cox was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in Cardiff on September 28, 1939. Her body was found but her killer has never been caught . The front page of the South Wales Echo shows the newspaper report following Joyce's death in September 1939, and reveals how officers want to track down a 'man with a slouch' in connection with her murder . Mr Phillips, who was not born at the time his relative was abducted and killed, used the Freedom of Information Act to find out more information about the case. He contacted the Met about the killing - the oldest unsolved murder in Wales - since the London-based force was drafted in to help South Wales Police with serious crimes at the time. He said that while he managed to establish that the force holds documents about the case, officers slapped an order on the file demanding it be kept secret for 100 years after the events concerned - until January 2040. A decision letter sent to Mr Phillips said: 'A named subject who was a suspect is described derogatorily and should not be associated with these matters. 'As an unsolved murder, with potential of re-investigation at any indeterminate stage, practice to close for 100 years is invoked. The family of Joyce (pictured) are accusing police of a 'cover-up' for not releasing paperwork on the case . 'However unlikely - indeed remote - it may be that this case is re-opened, we have to afford for that possibility. Putting information into the public domain will include naming specific persons who may yet be identified. 'These persons who may be living may have been witnesses and/or interviewees and who were not prosecuted and who therefore must be regarded as innocent parties. 'Persons will have given witness statements in the expectation that their information would not become public knowledge.' Mr Phillips said he 'does not accept the reason for refusing to release the documents'. He said: 'This smacks of a cover-up to me. As a result of this decision, which I am appealing against, I wouldn't get access to the file until I was 96, even

"Hedge fund trader Julian Rifat leaked insider tips about companies including Barclays and Volkswagen in exchange for a luxury car and holiday . A hedge fund trader who leaked insider tips about companies including Barclays and Volkswagen in exchange for a luxury car and a family holiday to Oman has been jailed. Julian Rifat, 45, abused his senior position at Moore Capital to leak tips about eight major firms. He used the inside information to place trades worth £285,000 through an associate to top up his basic salary of £125,000 and £615,000 bonus. Rifat, who lived in a £1.2million home in Oxford, was today jailed for 19 months during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court. His prosecution was the ninth under Operation Tabernula - an investigation launched in the wake of the financial crisis by regulators the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Rifat, once dubbed the 'face' of the American hedge fund, faced a single charge of insider dealing between 1 June and 24 November 2009. Prosecutor Mark Ellison QC, for the FCA, said: 'The total value of all eight trades being £285,000, they were all in the form of spread bets. '[Rifat] was employed at the time of offending as a senior trader by Moore Capital. He was FCA approved at the time of the offences and had been for a number of years. 'He was in essence, on the evidence, the person at Moore Capital in London that senior bankers would approach to discuss transactions. 'He was effectively, to a considerable degree, the face of Moore Capital in that respect for the purpose of European investment decisions. 'In fact in Mr Rifat's own words he says he was somebody who had direct access to the top four people in the firm. He was somebody who clearly was in a very responsible and trusted position.' Rifat would be approached by investors about major deals before the information was communicated to the market in a practice known as 'wall crossing'. Jailed: Rifat, from Oxford, leaked insider tips on major deals involving Barclays (pictured) and Volkswagen . However, he would then use this information to tip-off associate Graeme Shelley, a broker at Novum Securities Ltd, who placed trades on his behalf. In return, Shelley, 45, paid around £60,000, including a £15,000 family trip to Oman and a brand new Range Rover. Mr Ellison said: 'Once the inside was wall crossed within the company the entire firm was restricted from trading in the stock sharing until a public announcement was made or the offer withdrawn. 'After he had been wall crossed, Mr Rifat would make the time to give Mr Shelley either a ring or a text so as to provide the inside information.' Rifat, who worked in the company's London offices, was first arrested on his 41st birthday in 2010. Despite being put on administrative leave by his employers, he was still paid his huge salary as well as two £700,000 payments as part of a 'compromise agreement'. Rex Tedd QC, for Rifat, said his client was being paid cash that was owed to

"(CNN)Everywhere you look there are two-wheeled drivers waiting ominously for passengers to hop on board. They're the backbone of public transport in Uganda and the fastest way to get around the capital city, Kampala. The boda boda motorbike taxi is a staple used by all sectors of society. Traditionally, the usual way of catching a ride was to venture into any street corner packed with tens of boda bodas or simply waiting for one to pass by. But now, a new local startup are bringing this classic mode of transport into the technological age by providing the ability to hail a boda boda at the click of a smartphone. ""Bodas are the main thing getting people from A to B,"" says Alastair Sussock, co-founder of SafeBoda, ""and we're trying to professionalize this transportation in the city."" The motorbike taxis have their greatest popularity globally in Uganda, with over 80,000 riding the streets of Kampala, according to Sussex who wants to seize upon the country's burgeoning young population. Uganda has more than 24% of the population aged between 10 and 19 years old, according to UNICEF -- and Sussock wants them to get on their bikes. ""Young people use smartphones in Kampala and it's one of the youngest countries in the world,"" he says. For now, the Uber-like startup operates mainly in the northern districts of Kampala, where a click on the SafeBoda app -- in addition to the traditional method of hailing them on the street -- will bring you a Safeboda bike, complete with a uniformed driver in a bright orange jacket, helmet and fully trained in road safety. He'll even have a helmet for you. Safety has long been a concern for those riding boda bodas as the bikes are a leading cause of death and head injury in Kampala. A study conducted at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, by researchers at Makerere University, identified approximately 40% of trauma cases at the hospital to be due to boda-boda accidents. I request a SafeBoda to take me to meet the team in the upmarket area of Kisementi, in Kampala's central district. As i stand waiting, at least 10 regular boda bodas pass by beeping to get my attention and business. A driver called Richard Lalunga then arrives who I spot clearly in the distance thanks to his bright orange jacket and orange helmets -- one on his head and one on his handlebars. Lalunga has been a boda driver for four years and joined SafeBoda four months ago to learn more about road safety. He explains how he now earns more than ever before due to a loyal customer base stemming from his safe driving. The ride was in fact calmer than those taken with other bodas, and unlike some, as we ride along the congested streets no kerbs were scaled or mounted to avoid the traffic. The name stands - safeboda. The dangers lie in the low use of helmets -- by both drivers and users -- alongside risky driving and poor road safety practices. This makes many fearful

"Mark Hughes has accused Steve Bruce of trying to ‘defend the indefensible’ over Maynor Figueroa’s tackle on Stephen Ireland that left the Stoke City midfielder with a deep gash in his calf. The Hull City manager responded to Hughes’ anger at the incident by insisting Ireland should already have been sent off following ‘the worst challenge on the pitch’ on David Meyler at the Britannia Stadium. A picture of Ireland’s bloody leg was revealed in the aftermath of the match but Bruce said: ‘I could show you a picture of Figueroa's ankle, he had five stitches in it and carried on.’ Ireland (left) sustained a deep gash on his leg after a challenge from Hull's Maynor Figueroa . Referee Neil Swarbrick did not give a free kick for the challenge that left Ireland with a gash in his leg . The challenge left a wound on Ireland's leg that Stoke boss Mark Hughes said needed 12 to 15 stitches . That has angered Hughes, his former Manchester United team-mate. ‘Steve has fallen into the trap of trying to defend the indefensible,’ said Hughes. ‘Everyone has seen the two challenges and I don't think there is any sort of comparison whatsoever. ‘The outcome is there for everyone to see so I don't think Steve did himself too much credit with his observation. ‘It's fairly easily to defend things - and I do it too - but on this occasion it was not as if the lad would be suspended. So why did Steve not just say, “It was a terrible tackle”? 'We're trying to move on but Steve did not need to do that. He did not need to say that. To defend that is incorrect.’ Stoke boss Mark Hughes has accused Hull City counterpart Steve Bruce of trying to 'defend the indefensible' Hull boss Bruce queried why Stephen Ireland was on the pitch after his challenge on David Meyler . Hughes added: ‘It looks likely Stephen is unavailable for two to three weeks. ‘Most people now have seen the picture and he’s had internal stitches as well as external, so it takes a little bit longer than a straightforward gash. ‘I’m disappointed as he was doing really well, filling the gap for Bojan.’

"The original suspect in the murder of an America’s Next Top Model contestant and three others was scheduled to be ejected from the US in 2012 but was granted deferred deportation under President Obama’s amnesty policy, it was revealed today. Emmanuel Jesus Rangel-Hernandez, 19, was arrested last month in connection to a triple-homicide in Charlotte, North Carolina, that claimed the lives of aspiring model Mirjana Puhar, 19, her 23-year-old boyfriend Jonathan Alvarado, and 21-year-old Jusmar Isiah Gonzaga-Garcia. His alleged accomplice, 19-year-old David Ezequel Lopez, was taken into custody Thursday and jailed on three counts of first-degree murder. Scroll down for video . Dreamer: Emmanuel Jesus Rangel (right), 19, charged with the murder of America's Next Top Model contestant Mirjana Puhar (right), was supposed to be deported in 2012 but was granted amnesty . According to a statement released by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and GOP Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rangel was permitted to stay in the country under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Records indicate Rangel, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was placed in the removal process by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after being charged with drug violations in March 2012. On December 18, 2012, however, removal proceedings were dismissed because Rangel was approved for deferred action under the DACA policy, despite his suspected affiliation with a street gang, of which ICE was allegedly aware. 'Accomplice': Second suspect David Lopez, 19, charged with three counts of first-degree murder in deaths of Mirjana Puhar, Jonathan Alvarado and Jusmar Isiah Gonzaga-Garcia . ‘This raises serious concerns about USCIS’s review and approval of other DACA applicants and points to potential vulnerabilities in the system’ Senators Grassley and Tillis wrote in a letter sent in February to the Department of Homeland Security requesting information about Rangel’s status. Under the amnesty program, which was enacted by President Obama's executive action, more than 675,000 young immigrants since August 2012 have been granted a work permit and reprieve from deportation. Republicans have long decried Obama's executive immigration as a form of backdoor amnesty that circumvents Congress. Homeland Security Department documents say participation in the program can be revoked at any time. US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which approves applications, reported to the House Judiciary Committee last year the government stripped that protection from 113 people as of August. The revocations included one case of gang membership, one aggravated assault, 11 driving-under-the-influence cases and 11 errors by USCIS, according to the committee. As recently as last week, 15 criminal immigrants protected form deportation under DACA were arrested in raid carried out by federal agents. On Thursday, a second suspect, David Ezequel Lopez, 19, was charged with killing the former America's Next Top Model contestant, her boyfriend and another man, in what police were calling a drug-related attack. Lopez voluntarily came to police headquarters to be interviewed. He was then transported to the Mecklenburg County Jail. In late February, investigators arrested 19-year-old Rangel and charged him with the slayings, which have been described as drug-related. Rangel has also been charged in a

"A bus driver who claims to have eaten over 500 takeaways a year for 20 years has given up his habit to shed a whopping six stone. Mark Gadsby, from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, fed his addiction by tucking into Indian, Chinese and fish-and-chip takeaways at least once a day - and then binning the food packages to hide the evidence. But the 33-year-old ditched the convenience food and 20 years after being bullied as a teenager, he has shed six stone. Mark was eating takeaways everyday, left, before he joined slimming world and lost six stone, right . Mark, who works for a coach company, said: 'I'm utterly ashamed of what I was like.

'I was not eating all day when I was big - it was only at night. It was all about convenience food and the amount I ate was huge.

"(CNN)Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill on Friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. Nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Fallin's office said in a press release. CNN affiliate KFOR says it's never been used in an execution in the United States. ""The person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later. In other words, a humane, quick and painless death,"" said Rep. Mike Christian, one of the bill's authors, according to KFOR. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same ""painless"" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections. ""The hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which Oklahoma has managed its execution process historically,"" he said. Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections.

"A man who stabbed a young father to death has been filmed partying with prison hooch and singing to explicit rap lyrics in a sickening jail video. Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, is seen in the 50-second clip captured on a banned mobile phone as he dances outside his cell with other inmates at Coldingley prison in Surrey. He clutches a glass of the homemade illegal brew in the clip, which also shows a stash of drink bottles, biscuits and crisps on a window ledge, before it was shared with friends on WhatsApp. Scroll down for video . Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, who was jailed for stabbing a young father, has been filmed partying behind bars . He was caught on camera drinking illegal alcohol and dancing to explicit rap music with other inmates at Coldingley prison in Surrey . Prison officers reportedly turned a blind eye to the partying, which happened in the run-up to Christmas in December last year. Tesfamichael was jailed for life with a minimum of 13 years after he used a broken champagne bottle to stab Olu Olagbaju, 26, in Shadan's nightclub in the City of London in December 2006. The music producer collapsed and died after the attack, where witnesses described seeing the young father being held with his arms behind his back before he was stabbed in the chest. Eritrean-born Tesfamichael, then 23 and living in Camden, north London, made his getaway in a Mercedes before fleeing to Italy and then Miami, U.S., before he was extradited back to Britain. The 50-second video clip was captured on a banned mobile phone and shared with friends on WhatsApp . Eritrean-born Tesfamichael will spend a minimum of 13 years behind bars for the stabbing of Olu Olagbaju, 26 . Mr Olagbaju was looking forward to the birth of his second child with fiancee Terri Jacob, who he already had a daughter with, when he was killed. The Ministry of Justice launched an internal investigation at the Category C prison, which houses 500 inmates, and dealt with those involved. A spokesperson from the Prison Service said: 'All identified prisoners have faced disciplinary action. This type of behaviour will not be tolerated.' Tesfamichael wears a grey vest as he dances around the prison with another inmate, who wears sunglasses . The footage also shows a stash of drinks bottles, crisps and biscuits being stored on a window ledge . The video has outraged members of the public after it was shared on social media. Vikki Heywood, wrote on Facebook: 'I think it's disgusting the stuff they can get up to in prison these days. I've seen other ones of take aways and stuff like that. 'They are there to be punished not rewarded. If they have it soo cosy they will never learn from there's mistakes [sic].' Richard Jones added: 'What's more shameless is that it's the authorities allowing the ""party"" to take place.' Others described it as 'shocking' and 'disgraceful'.

"Brazil legend Pele has praised his country's current star Neymar as 'an excellent young player' but says he will never replace him as the footballing 'king' even if he matches his goalscoring record. Neymar has scored 42 international goals despite only turning 23 last month, and Pele's Brazilian record of 77 strikes is well within his sights with a long career at the top still ahead of him. But the 74-year-old Brazilian icon feels that even if the young pretender can match his incredible feat, he will still not be considered in the same class as him. Brazil legend Pele says that even if Neymar matches his goalscoring record he still won't be the 'king' Neymar has 42 international goals at the age of just 23 and could easily catch Pele if he keeps up that rate . 'I think to be the new king, the new Pele, is impossible,' he said of Neymar. 'My mother and my father closed the machine. I think he's a good player, an excellent young player and he's going to be a big star, no doubt.' Brazil face France on Wednesday night in Paris and Pele feels that despite their humiliation at the last tournament on home territory, Brazil can prove to be an international force again ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. 'I think to be the new king, the new Pele, is impossible,' Pele said of his young pretender in the national team . Neymar leads the ball away from Dani Carvajal as Barcelona won El Clasico against Real Madrid on Sunday . When asked whether Brazil, being led once again by head coach Dunga, could win the title in Russia in three years time, Pele said: 'I hope so. 'I think with Dunga, (he) has a different style to Felipe (Scolari), more defensive, but I believe in Dunga. He could make a good national team.' Brazilian coach Dunga has Pele's backing, with the legendary forward saying he could win the World Cup .

"(CNN)Tunisia's tourism industry has been thrown into disarray by a terror attack on Wednesday that left at least 17 foreign visitors dead and prompted urgent warnings over security. Only just recovering from the impact of the Arab Spring uprisings four years ago, Tunisia has once again emerged as a winter sun draw for tens of thousands of travelers. But following Wednesday's attack and siege at the prestigious Bardo Museum in central Tunis, the country's tourism industry is once again facing jeopardy even as authorities and operators scramble to ensure the safety of visitors currently in the country. A significant number of foreign tourists were inside the museum at the time of the attack, which government officials said was the work of ""Islamists."" Prime Minister Habib Essid said Polish, Italian, German and Spanish tourists are among those killed, with another 20 tourists plus two Tunisians wounded in the attack. MSC Cruises said its ship, MSC Splendida, is currently docked in the Tunis port of La Goulette and some of its passengers had been on tours of the city, including the Bardo at the time of the attack. ""All the tourist coaches on tour were immediately recalled to the port and all other tours on the ground were immediately suspended,"" MSC said in a statement. Another ship, the Costa Fascinosa, docked in Tunis at that time, has a manifest of more than 3,000 passengers, its parent company Costa Cruise said. As details of the incident emerged, several foreign governments put out warnings urging their citizens to stay away from the scene of the attacks, around an area that includes the national parliament building. The U.S. Embassy in Tunis issued an alert that also reiterated standing advice about the potential for violence in Tunisia and the risk of kidnappings. Its warning cautions against trips to Tunisia's central, southern and border regions. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) also urged UK citizens to stay away from the affected areas of Tunis and to ""follow the instructions of Tunisian security authorities."" Its warning also carried longstanding advice: ""There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners."" With tens of thousands of foreign visitors likely to be in Tunisia right now and many more contemplating travel there, travel operators have been rushing to formulate a response to the attack. It's not immediately known if flights will be added to accommodate any sudden surge in departures or whether tour operators will pull out of the country -- responses that followed a terror attack in Kenya last year. Thomson and First Choice, a UK-based travel operator that carries thousands of vacationers on package trips to Tunisia, said it had canceled organized excursions to Tunis as a precaution. A statement said it would follow FCO advice, which overall remained unchanged for Tunisia. ""Thomson and First Choice customers stay in beach destinations, not Tunis, and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by the incident that took place there today,"" it said.

"A mere 53 hours to kick-off and all is serene at the training base of Queens Park Rangers. Mowers clip along on distant pitches as the sun beats down and the whitewashed pavilion is brightened by pots of forget-me-nots, a flower which could be adopted as the emblem of relegation. QPR boss Chris Ramsey appears relaxed and untroubled, insisting he had more sleepless nights coaching Tottenham last season and joking about the difference between Lidl and Waitrose. His job is to chase pressure and negativity away at times like this, but beneath the surface fear tightens its grip on those near the drop zone. QPR boss Chris Ramsey (centre) is one of seven managers trying to keep their club in the Premier League . Ramsey's side host West Ham on Saturday as they look to climb out of the relegation zone with four games left . Cesc Fabregas' 88th minute strike saw Chelsea grab a late 1-0 win at QPR earlier this month . It will be the same at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Leicester, Sunderland and Hull. Even at Burnley, where Sean Dyche was keen on Thursday to stress his club feel no pressure because their financial commitments are so much less than their rivals. ‘We are probably half the wage bill of the next team in the division, let alone all the superpowers, and half the spending of the next team in the division,’ said Dyche. The financial implications are bigger for others but there still exists a fear of sporting failure, a fear of letting people down, a fear of losing your job, your status, security, your self-esteem. These everyday, human anxieties trouble Premier League footballers, too. When Cesc Fabregas celebrated Chelsea’s winner in the 88th minute at Loftus Road two weeks ago, Ramsey curled into a ball on the touchline and bottled up his fury until he was well clear of the dressing room. ‘It was old-school,’ he smiled. ‘I was a little bit angry. The cat was running. I was so disappointed, probably the most disappointed I’ve been. It was a very soft goal and it would have given us a massive lift to know we could compete with a team of that calibre.’ Four of the bottom seven did not play in the Barclays Premier League last weekend and watched helplessly as Leicester won again, tightening the pack. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says his side have had to compete with the smallest wage budget in the league . NEWCASTLE . Swansea (Home) - April 25 . Leicester (Away) - May 2 .

"Chelsea are considering a renewed bid to sign Raphael Varane from Real Madrid this summer. Jose Mourinho is a confirmed admirer of the France international centre-back and is willing to test Real Madrid's resolve to hold onto the 21-year-old. Jose Mourinho feels Chelsea need a commanding centre-half like Raphael Varane . Varane is valued at £40million by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and was signed after being persuaded by Zinedine Zidane that Madrid was where his future lay. However, Varane has grown frustrated this year with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Pepe and Sergio Ramos as his centre-back pairing when fit. Manchester United are also keeping tabs on Varane after losing out to Real Madrid in 2011. Real Madrid have slapped a £40m price tag on French defender Varane . Age: 21 . Appearances: Lens 23/Goals 2; . Real Madrid 76 (20)/5; France 17/1 . Varane has been labelled Real Madrid's Lion and former France defender Frank Leboeuf believes he has the potential to be better than Real Madrid legend Fernando Hierro . Varane signed a new six-year contract at the start of the season . The 21-year-old has grown frustrated with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Pepe and Sergio Ramos as his centre-back pairing when fit . Sir Alex Ferguson was keen to sign him from Lens and the Old Trafford club will challenge for his signature again should Madrid show a willingness to deal. Mourinho has concerns about the centre of his defence. Gary Cahill has sometimes looked uneasy against European opposition while John Terry is 34. Kurt Zouma has done well this season but is still inexperienced and Varane is already an assured performer at international level. Chelsea captain Terry will be given a new one year contract while Branislav Ivanovic, who is 31, has 16 months left on contract. The Blues also have Andreas Christensen and Tomas Kalas in reserve but both lack big game experience. Jose Mourinho has concerns over John Terry and Gary Cahill in the centre of his defence .

"Pakistan-born bowler Fawad Ahmed has been tipped to give England a stern examination this summer after being called into Australia's Ashes squad on Tuesday. The 33-year-old, who sought asylum in Australia in 2010 before securing residency two years later, is one of 17 players selected for both the five-Test series and a preceding tour of the West Indies. Ahmed took 48 wickets during Victoria's triumphant Sheffield Shield campaign, catching the eye of national selector Rod Marsh, who feels the spinner can make life difficult for England's batsmen when the Ashes series starts in July. Fawad Ahmed celebrates after taking eight wickets for Victoria in the Sheffield Shield final last week . Ahmed bats for Victoria during the Sheffield Shield final with Western Australia in Hobart . 'Him being a leg-spinner as opposed to a finger spinner gave him a slight advantage,' Marsh said at a press conference organised to announce the squad. 'Believe it or not, Australia is always looking for leg-spinners. We've had a proud history of leg-spinning in this country and we want that to continue. '(Ahmed) doesn't bowl too much rubbish and he creates a lot of pressure. 'He has men around the bat in most instances and he keeps asking the batsmen questions, which is what good spinners do. 'He maintains good economy and asks questions of both left and right-handers, bearing in mind that England may have up to seven left-handers.' Ahmed pictured during a one-day international with England at Old Trafford in September 2013 . Ahmed has caught the eye of Australian selector Rod Marsh (left), seen here with Adam Gilchrist . There was no place for all-rounder Glenn Maxwell despite his World Cup heroics but Adam Voges, the scorer of 1358 runs in Shield cricket last season, will be on the plane departing for the West Indies on May 19. One-day specialist Maxwell, named in the International Cricket Council's team of the tournament following Sunday's triumph over New Zealand in Melbourne, made only 41 runs and failed to take a wicket against Pakistan in his last Test appearance for the Baggy Green back in October. Marsh said of Voges: 'I looked at him on four or more occasions and I thought 'I don't know how anyone will get this bloke out', he was that dominant. 'It wasn't just the 1300-odd runs, it was the way he made them. 'It was as good a Sheffield Shield batting as I have ever seen. Pure weight of runs, the way in which he got those runs, you could see Test player written all over him.' Adam Voges, seen here playing for Western Australia, has been selected after an excellent season . Glenn Maxwell has not been picked in the squad despite helping Australia to World Cup success . While fast bowler Ryan Harris is included, he will remain in Australia throughout the tour of the West Indies, which begins in Dominica on June 5, as he anticipates the birth of his first child.

"Dozens of cheap and popular California wines are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic, claims a new lawsuit filed this week. Sutter Home, Korbel, Franzia and Trader Joe's Charles Shaw White Zifandel, also known as 'Two-Buck Chuck,' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe. Twenty-eight California wineries were listed in the complaint, which is asking for a halt in production of the wines in question. Scroll down for video . A new lawsuit claims dozens of cheap and popular California Wine, including Franzia and Trader Joe's Charles Shaw White Zifandel, are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic . The lawsuit was filed by four individual Southern California wine consumers who, according to their attorney Brian Kabateck, had 1,306 wines tested at a Denver-based laboratory and then confirmed results with two additional laboratories. Kabateck said 83 wines, almost all of which sell for below $10 a bottle, contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard. 'This is a very serious public health concern,' Kabateck said. 'We would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately.' 'If not voluntarily, we would ask the court to do it.' The United States does not have a set standard for safe levels of arsenic in wine, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The lawsuit claims 83 of the 1,306 wines that were tested contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water . But wines are allowed to have arsenic levels up to 100 parts per billion in Canada - and other countries allow even higher levels. The Wine Institute, an advocacy group for California wineries, called the lawsuit 'misleading' and 'false'. According to Institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi, California wines have never come close to exceeding the arsenic levels that are accepted in other countries, she told the Associated Press. In a release statement, the Institute said arsenic was 'prevalent in the natural environment' and that 'no research' had found the amounts in wine to 'pose a health risk to consumers'. The lawsuit specifies the wines contained 'inorganic arsenic,' which is more toxic than the arsenic found naturally in the environment. Chronic long-term consumption of inorganic arsenic can cause cancer, as well as liver and kidney damage. But a number of wine producers have fought back at the lawsuit and said they plan to contest the claims. A Trader Joe's spokesman said the grocery store chain had 'no reason to believe the wines we offer are unsafe, including Charles Shaw White Zinfandel'. Korbel said the lawsuit was 'without merit,' adding that the company plans to challenge the allegations. The 83 bottles of wine cited in a lawsuit this week as having dangerously high levels of arsenic came from 28 California wineries and were bottled under 31 different brand labels. Some of

"As Manchester United turned in their most dominant display of the season against Tottenham on Sunday, the influence of one man cannot be underestimated. Michael Carrick's return to Louis van Gaal's starting XI proved crucial at Old Trafford, and could be the turning point for United as they look to finish in the top four this season. He took less than nine minutes to stamp his authority on the game and show the Old Trafford faithful what they have so missed during his two months out. Michael Carrick (second left) heads Manchester United 2-0 up against Tottenham on Sunday . Carrick is congratulated on his goal by his United team-mates during the 3-0 win at Old . UNITED WITH CARRICK . P15 W10 D3 L2 . Win percentage: 66.70% . Points per game: 2.2 . UNITED WITHOUT CARRICK . P14 W6 D5 L3 . Win percentage: 42.90% . Points per game: 1.6 . With Daley Blind on the ball at left back and no Tottenham players covering a huge gap just in from the left touchline, Carrick burst forward to receive the ball before instantly playing a perfectly weighted pass for Marouane Fellaini to open the scoring for United. Ten minutes later Carrick had headed his side 2-0 up and sent them on the way to a vital win. But it was the composure and attacking intent that Carrick provided on Sunday that United have missed so much in recent weeks - something which was not lost on his manager. 'Michael Carrick is not my second captain for nothing. He is one of the best passers also, not only wide but also forward. We need midfielders who have that passing,' said Van Gaal after the game. Indeed, with Carrick in the side United have picked up 2.2 points per game compared to just 1.6 without him.

But while most of its relatives were shark-like apex predators with circular mouths ringed by sharp teeth, the new species, named Aegirocassis benmoulae, was a 'gentle giant'. The 6.5ft (two-metre) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans, insects and spiders. Like modern-day whales, it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food, using spine-covered 'limbs' on its head. Fossils also show that Aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body. These were likely to be precursors of the unique double-branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans. Like modern-day whales, it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food, using spine-covered 'limbs' on its head. Modern-day lobsters grow to around 19 inches (50cm) and modern-day whales average at around 79ft (25 metres). Dr Allison Daley, from Oxford University, who co-led a team studying Aegirocassis writing in the journal Nature, said: 'This would have been one of the largest animals alive at the time. 'These animals are filling an ecological role that hadn't previously been filled by any other animal. 'While filter-feeding is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food, previous filter-feeders were smaller, and usually attached to the sea-floor.

"(CNN)Ferguson City Manager John Shaw resigned Tuesday in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report. The report blames Ferguson, Missouri, police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets African-American residents. ""Over the last several months I have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community,"" Shaw wrote in his resignation letter. He continued: ""During this time I have also worked closely with the Department of Justice to identify opportunities to improve, and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change. ""And while I certainly respect the work that the DOJ recently performed in their investigation and report on the City of Ferguson, I must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target African Americans, nor falsify charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor. Any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false."" Shaw's resignation was announced the same day the City Council voted 7-0 on a mutual separation agreement with Shaw. Residents elect City Council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including the Police Department. Along with other officials, Shaw was heavily criticized by the Justice Department report, which found that authorities in Ferguson frequently saw residents as ""sources of revenue."" In fact, the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that Ferguson, population 21,000, was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in St. Louis County by having more than $1 million in revenue in 2010, the report said. In one March 2012 email, the captain of the patrol division reported to Shaw that court collections the previous month reached $235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $200,000. The city manager reported the email to the City Council, congratulating police and court staff on their ""great work,"" the report said. When Ferguson court revenues exceeded $2 million for the whole of 2012, the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email: ""Awesome! Thanks!"" according to the federal report. The DOJ's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in August. Wilson, who was not indicted on any charges, has resigned from the police department. But when Ferguson resident Sue Schmidt defended Wilson at Tuesday's City Council meeting, she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd. ""I'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe Darren Wilson an apology,"" Schmidt said, prompting laughter by some in the audience. ""The same justice report that you're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100%."" CNN's Jennifer Feldman, Holly Yan, Sarah Aarthun and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

"A New York college has provoked anger after postponing its screening of movie American Sniper in response to complaints from Muslim students. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday. It said it will still show the Oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film. Bradley Cooper in his Oscar Nominated role as Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in US military history . The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (pictured) in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday . The film was postponed because senior management at the college did not want to create animosity or tension among its students. However they appear to have done just the opposite. Following complaints from the RPI’s Muslim Students’ Association a number of students have said the postponement was an act of censorship and an attack on free speech, Fox News reported. While the film grossed a total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis . A statement from the university explained the aim of the screening, coupled with the now scheduled educational forum, was to allow students in the campus community to ‘participate in an intellectual discourse about the film and current world events’. American Sniper, a film by Clint Eastwood about US Navy Seal sharp-shooter Chris Kyle the most deadly sniper in US history, has courted controversy since it was first shown in the US in November. While the film grossed an international total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis. It was also accused of stoking racial hatred after screenings of the film led to a rise in threats against Americans of Middle Eastern origin and even some attacks on Muslims outside movie theaters. Earlier this month the University of Michigan flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus. The college pulled a screening over student complaints but quickly did an about-face after news of the cancellation sparked a firestorm on campus. The school released statement saying the decision to cancel had not been consistent with the high value it placed on freedom of expression. Navy Seal and Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle, depicted in the film, was killed at a shooting range in Texas . The school's vice president for student life, E. Royster Harper, acknowledged that it was ‘a mistake’ to call off the screening. ‘The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location,’ Harper’s statement read. ‘We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern.’ An Alternative screening of the Paddington Bear movie was offered to those students who did not want to watch the American Sniper. Earlier this month the University of Michigan (pictured) flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus .

"With summer around the corner, icy treats are back on the menu. But if there is one phase transition in which food can become frustrating – by giving us brain freeze and by getting painfully stuck to our mouths – then it is when it is frozen. As a fly – perhaps the creature you would least expect to be in this position – found out when it swooped in to have a lick of a frozen beef steak. The fly is initially featured looking rather pleased as it fastens its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste . Like the infamous scene from Dumb and Dumber involving ice, a ski lift and a tongue, the fly becomes attached to the frozen food. Videoed up-close, the fly is initially captured enjoying itself as it fastens its big tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste. Satisfied, it then goes to fly away home when suddenly it notices that it is stuck and a sense of panic sets in. Realising that its tongue is stuck to the frozen beef steak, the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free . Moving its legs, the fly at first attempts to walk away, before arching its back and trying with all its might to pull itself free. It tries this two more times, but much to its annoyance it stays attached to the beef steak as it stops to look at the camera. As the video goes on the fly tries harder and harder to set itself free – beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly. The fly tries hard to set itself free by beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly . But nothing seems to work and as it slumps, looking sorry for itself, all appears to have been lost. Luckily for the fly however, help emerges in the form of a human thumb, which attempts to set it free with a little prod. Failing this, the video maker then picks up a little heat gun and begins thawing out the ice around the fly and ultimately setting it free. The video was recorded in Auckland, New Zealand. The fly appears to give up hope but eventually the video maker intervenes and sets the creature free .

"Channel Ten show The Project has apologised after mistakenly using footage of the wrong African-American comic when promoting upcoming guest on the show, Saturday Night Live star Michael Che. ‘Tomorrow, we’ll chat to the star of the Daily Show and Saturday Night Live, Michael Che,’ the promo promised – although, in a cringeworthy gaffe, two of the three clips shown were of Che’s castmate, Jay Pharoah. Che and Pharoah are both in Australia to perform a string of shows at Melbourne’s International Comedy Festival.

Aly admitted to the mistake to the audience, pointing out that the footage they’d used earlier was of two different people. ‘We stuffed that up, viewer Prue Knox was quick and tweeted us within minutes, so thank you Prue,’ Aly said. ‘Yes, so that happened,’ he continued, clearly embarrassed. ‘That’s certaintly something to talk to Michael about tomorrow,’ Georgie Coghlan laughed. ‘Maybe we can just get him to sit in this seat and see if anyone notices,’ Aly said pointedly. Pharoah saw the funny side of the incident and shared viewers’ tweets about the blunder on his own account. ‘The Project just played a a few clips for upcoming guest Michael Che and 2 of the clips were of Jay Pharoah #AWKWARD,’ tweeted Prue Knox. ‘Hey The Project, you do know that Michael Che and Jay Pharoah are two different people yeah? #ouch,’ Susan Bong tweeted, accompanied with a video of the gaffe.

"A religious cult that isolates followers from the 'evil' outside world has defended its practices after a family of 14 fled declaring they had been living in a 'false system'. James Ben Canaan walked out on the Gloriavale Christian Community, located in Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast, suddenly at the weekend with his wife Hope and 12 children. The commune, who refused to go into detail about the Ben Canaan family's sudden departure, hit back at the family's accusations arguing that it was 'entirely their choice to leave', the New Zealand Herald reports. Scroll down for video . Children dressed in Cooperite clothing walk at Gloriavale Christian Community located at Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast . Children at the school in Gloriavale Christian Community. The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members . 'No one is here against their will. We only want people who want to be here,' Fervent Stedfast, a Gloriavale member since 1970, said. 'We're here simply and entirely because we want to be here.' It comes as the daughter of Gloriavale's leader, Neville Cooper, spoke out for the first time since leaving the remote community about her struggles to reintegrate in the 'outside world'. Miracle left the cult, which forces people to wear the same uniform and bans birth control, five years ago with her husband and 10 children, 3News reports. Miracle said there was no doubt the Ben Canaan family would struggle like she did to integrate into society. 'Making a decision to come on the outside you leave with basically the clothes on your back,' she said. 'I think the biggest struggle is at our age - I was 45 - and to start life from scratch, normally you would have built up a life from a young age. 'The struggle is just so hard. 'You don’t know any obligations to renting a home, opening bank accounts. You don’t even have a birth certificate or driver’s licence – or any identity to even be able to do those things.' The Ben Canaan family, who are among a number of large families to walk out on Gloriavale in recent years, are now staying 300km away in Timaru. Miracle, daughter of Gloriavale's leader, Neville Cooper, has spoken for the first time since leaving the remote community five years ago about her struggles to reintegrate in the 'outside world' The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control . James and Hope Ben Canaan have since forsaken their nun-like headdresses and white bibs to put on everyday clothes, while their children have removed their hooded hats and blue uniforms. 'It's a huge deal for them to stop wearing their community clothes and so they are going to transition slowly,' Liz Gregory, who has offered the family of 14 her home, told the New Zealand Herald on Wednesday. The father, who managed the commune's self-sufficient dairy farm for 20 years, is now looking for a job.

"Cocaine use in Britain has trebled in two decades, with a new 'phenomenon' of rising drugs consumption among people in their forties and fifties. A new government report launched amid concern that cocaine is seen as safe found it is no longer 'the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities'. Its authors found the drug is now 'firmly embedded in UK society', and warned launching an anti-cocaine campaign could encourage more people to take it. Cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens, but there have been significant increases among people in their forties and fifties . The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said the drug has spread throughout all areas of society since the mid-1990s. It follows the emergence of a market in cheap, low-purity powdered cocaine that operates alongside a more expensive and far higher purity version of the drug. A line of the cheaper version can now be bought for just £2 – less than the price of a coffee. Cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens but while usage among younger age groups has fluctuated in recent years, figures from the Office for National Statistics show the percentage of over-35s taking cocaine at least once in the past year increased from 0.8 per cent in 2001/2 to 1.5 per cent in 2013/14 – the equivalent of about 188,000 men and women. Over the same period, use among adults described as ‘comfortably off’ rose from 1.5 per cent to 1.9 per cent. Overall just over 810,000 men and women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales used the drug at least once last year – 2.4 per cent of the population. It is the highest rate in Europe. Use among older adults has been less common, particularly among 45-54 year olds. In 2013-14, 1.8 per cent of people aged 34-44 took cocaine up from 1.3 per cent a decade earlier. Among 45-54-year-olds the figure doubled from 0.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent. But the report said: 'It is notable that there have been statistically significant increases (1996 to 2013-14) across all age groups up to the age of 54 years; a phenomenon that has not been observed in respect of other drug types.' It could be that more people are taking up cocaine later in life, but the data suggests it is the result of 'continued use among an ageing user cohort', suggesting age does not lead to people giving the drug up. The access to cheap cocaine - often mixed with harmful cutting agents - is 'highly likely' to have driven the rise in the number of users from 'hard pressed' or low income backgrounds, as well as the 'comfortably off', living outside cities where drug use was traditionally uncommon. The report, addressed to Home Secretary Theresa May and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is the first of its kind to investigate powdered cocaine use and was launched in response to fears of a perception that the drug is safe as use increased.

"Swansea manager Garry Monk believes a strong finish will put a different slant on Everton's season - but he is determined to stop his former manager Roberto Martinez profiting at his old Liberty Stadium stomping ground on Saturday. Martinez was lauded by Everton fans last season as the club qualified for Europe with a fifth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League. But the going has been a lot tougher for the Spaniard in his second season on Merseyside with Everton having only removed the spectre of relegation by winning their last three matches. Garry Monk wants Swansea to continue their own impressive form with victory over Everton on Saturday . Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) scored twice for Swansea in their 3-1 victory over Hull last weekend . Ki Sung-Yueng (second right) also got on the scoresheet as Swansea maintained their impressive form . Vandals even defaced the outside of Goodison Park with 'Martinez Out' and 'Not Good Enough' sprayed on the wall of a stand in white paint, but Monk insists that is simply a part of modern-day football when results do not go your way. 'I always say you're only a few games away from being great or rubbish,' Monk said. 'Roberto is a good manager, but sometimes you have good periods and sometimes you have bad ones. 'It's just making sure you come through them and he's won the last three games, they're back on the up and he'll want to finish the season strongly. 'Of course they'd want to be pushing further up the league and it's not a position you'd associate with Everton. 'But if they can get back up to finish positively it will put a different twist on the season.' Everton have had to balance their domestic commitments with a demanding Europa League campaign which saw them knocked out at the round-of-16 stage last month. And Monk knows from Swansea being in the competition last season how much that has an impact on Premier League performances and results. 'Europe is tough, the travelling and constant games in certain periods,' Monk said. 'It all adds up and the intensity of the football at this level takes it out of you and takes its toll. 'Whether it (Everton's results) is all down to that I don't know, but it does play a major part and if you look at the teams who have played in the Europa League, including ourselves, it has had an impact.' Swansea have never beaten Everton in the league but they claimed a point at Goodison Park in November after being reduced to 10 men following Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal. Martinez criticised Swansea's 'strange' tactics and style of play that day but Monk put it down to 'more frustration with his own side and not winning the game'. Roberto Martinez is hoping to continue Everton's form against his former team in the Premier League . Monk (right) holds no ill feeling towards Martinez, despite him criticising Swansea after defeat in November . 'It might have been a game they'd targeted to win and when it doesn't

"A Western gray whale has made the longest known migration by any mammal. The female, named Varvara, swam 14,000 miles (22,500km) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back, without even stopping for a snack when she was nine years old. Her return journey across the North Pacific raises questions about the critically endangered creature’s conservation status. A Western gray whale (pictured) has made the longest known migration by any mammal. The female, named Varvara, swam 14,000 miles (22,500) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back, reportedly without stopping for a snack . Until now, scientists believed there were two distinct groups of gray whale - the Eastern gray whale, which travels along the west coast of US, and the much rarer Western gray whale, which journeys along the coast of eastern Asia. The researchers used satellite-monitoring tags to track three Western North Pacific gray whales from their primary feeding ground off Russia’s Sakhalin Island across the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the US to Baja, Mexico. The experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of Russia for years and tracked the record-breaking journey over five-and-half months between 2011 and 2012. Gray whales typically don't feed during migration, which has led researchers to believe Varvara didn't eat during the long journey either. They found that Varvara, which is Russian for Barbara, visited the three major breeding areas for Eastern gray whales, which are found off North America, according to the study published by the Royal Society in the journal Biology Letters. Her return journey across the North Pacific raises questions about the critically endangered creature’s conservation status. Experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of Russia for years and tracked the record-breaking journey between 2011 and 2012. A Western gray whale is shown . ‘It is very impressive,’ Professor Bruce Mate, of Oregon State University, told MailOnline. ‘These whales have the same body temperature as you and I, so they are obliged to make these big journeys to get to warmer or cooler waters. But this is a record.’ ‘Until now we thought they were not very good navigators,’ he continued. Varvarva is a 13-year-old Western gray whale. She is now famous for making the longest migration of any mammal when she was aged nine. The whale was tagged off Russia's Sakhalin Island in September 2011. Experts expected her to swim along Asia's Pacific shoreline down to the South China Sea. But instead, she turned up off Mexico's Baja Peninsula instead and mingled with Eastern gray whales near their nursery lagoon in Mexico. Experts tracked Varvara to find that she made a swam 14,000 miles (22,500) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back. Her journey is helping scientists make a surprising new discovery about migration patterns. ‘We thought that they just stuck to the coast, keeping the sound of the surf on one side, going up and

"(CNN)The United Nations is appealing for $174 million to help Nigerian refugees who've fled to neighboring nations following militant attacks. Boko Haram has killed thousands in the nation's northeast by attacking villages, schools, churches and mosques. It has also kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls abducted in April last year. A majority of them remain missing. The militants have attacked relentlessly for six years, sending 192,000 people seeking shelter in Cameroon, Niger and Chad. ""Displaced people in northeastern Nigeria and across borders are in a very dramatic situation, they fear for their lives and are at this point unable to return to their homes,"" said Liz Ahua, who's coordinating Nigerian refugee efforts for the U.N. Aid agencies are scrambling to provide the refugees with clean water, shelter, food and access to education. ""In the refugee camps, thousands of school-age refugee children cannot attend school because of lack of classrooms and teachers,"" Ahua said. Mental health needs are crucial to help the survivors of physical attacks and those who've witnessed violence, according to the U.N. Some children are separated from their parents amid the trauma. ""The conflict has had a devastating impact on children, including many who were forcibly recruited by the insurgents in Nigeria,"" Ahua said. The appeal encompasses the needs of 23 agencies and nongovernmental organizations helping the refugees. ""Adequate funding is crucial to make sure aid agencies can improve the living conditions for refugees in asylum countries and respond to their protection needs,"" Ahua said. ""We relocate refugees away from the conflict border areas, and establish additional refugee camps where needed."" The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. An additional 1.2 million people are displaced within Nigeria as a result of the insurgency. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report .

"Extra-curricular: John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, says pupils need more than just A*s . The glut of top grades at GCSE and A-level is forcing employers to focus on young people’s extra-curricular activities, according to a business leader. John Cridland – director general of the Confederation of British Industry – said his members must consider character-building elements of a candidate’s CV, rather than just qualifications. He told the Times Educational Supplement that ‘frankly everybody has A*s’ and said employers want someone who ‘stands out from the crowd’. ‘What have you done in the local theatre club? 'What have you done in the local sports club? 'What have you done to put something back into the community?’ he said. ‘[These] are just as important to employers.’ He added that most bosses ‘do not recruit on subject or qualification’ but look for ‘enthusiasm, creativity and passion’. The CBI has previously bemoaned the poor quality of candidates entering the workplace, criticising levels of numeracy and literacy. However Mr Cridland stopped short of suggesting ‘character’ should be taught as a separate subject, saying: ‘A good teacher develops these things in the classroom while teaching English.’ He added that Ofsted inspections should focus more on the all-round development of pupils. Extra-curricular: He suggests pupils look at extra activities which may impress future bosses .

"Masters Wednesday began on a sombre note when Australian Marc Leishman, who got so close to victory in 2013 before finishing tied fourth behind countryman Adam Scott, had to withdraw. His wife Audrey spent part of last week in an induced coma owing to a serious infection. Leishman left Augusta taking with him the best wishes of his sport. Marc Leishman has withdrawn from this year's competition to be with his wife . Masters chairman Billy Payne talked a lot about growing the game but he ruled out any idea of starting a women’s Masters. ‘We have a very short member season at Augusta National of seven months,’ he explained. ‘The time that we dedicate to the preparation and conduct of the tournament is already extensive. I don’t think we would ever host another one.’ Billy Payne has ruled out starting a women's Masters despite talking about growing the game . It’s well-known the garish surroundings outside Augusta National contrast markedly with the beauty within. But maybe that’s about to change. After buying up all the houses on adjacent Berckmans Road and turning it into a patrons’ car park, Masters chairman Billy Payne is promising a ‘beautification’ project. ‘As you know, we’re pretty good at landscaping,’ he said. ‘It’s going to look nice, I promise.’ Mr Unpopular Bubba Watson can surely not have upset anyone with his choice of menu for the Champions Dinner on Tuesday. Clearly he enjoyed it so much two years ago he decided to stick with the same inoffensive offering: Caesar salad followed by grilled chicken breast with green beans, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and cornbread.

"A heavily armed Algerian jihadi who was preparing to attack churches in Paris on the orders is in custody this morning after being implicated in the murder of a young woman. The 24-year-old, named locally as Sid Ahmed Ghlam, had shot himself in the leg before his arrest by anti-terrorist officers in the 13th arrondissement in southern Paris on Sunday. This afternoon the Paris prosecutor said police found Arabic documents mentioning ISIS and Al Qaeda at the IT student's home, as well as evidence on his computer that he was in contact with a man in Syria 'who clearly asked him to target a church.' Sunday's arrest came just hours after the murder of Aurelie Chatelain, a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor, who was riddled with bullets as she sat in her car in a car park in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Investigators reportedly claim DNA evidence links Ghlam to her murder. Scroll down for video . Sid Ahmed Ghlam (pictured) had shot himself in the leg before his arrest by anti-terrorist officers .

Gathered: This is the student residence where Sid Ahmed Ghlam - a 24-year-old computer science student suspected of plotting imminent attacks on churches in France - had reportedly been living . French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve today said: 'A terrorist attack was foiled on Sunday morning.' 'The police discovered an arsenal containing weapons of war, and a suspect was immediately taken into custody.' Victim: DNA tests reportedly link the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain (pictured) on Sunday . Mr Cazeneuve said the suspect was found on a street in the 13th arrondissement of Paris with a bullet in his leg, and bleeding heavily. He originally claimed to be the victim of an attack by criminals, but officers followed the trail of blood to his car, where they found a Kalashnikov assaultrifle, and a Sig-Sauer automatic pistol. There were also stolen police armbands which would enable him to pose as a plain clothes officer. In Ghlam's student accommodation, detectives later found three automatic rifles, handguns, and bulletproof vests. There were also Jihadi flags and literature, false passports, and plans for attacks on 'one or two' churches in the Paris area. DNA analysis reportedly linked the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain, who was originally from Caudry, in northern France. The arrested man was an Algerian national studying computer science in Paris, and was known to the intelligence services. The man had been considered a likely candidate to travel to Syria to fight with the Islamic State terrorist organisation, said Mr Cazeneuve, and was officially under surveillance.

"Palmerston remains a very painful place for Rangers managers. Consider this the first harsh lesson of Stuart McCall’s tenure. Back in the chill of mid-December, Ally McCoist led the Ibrox side here on the day it emerged he had handed in his notice of resignation. A convincing 2-0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club. Nine days later, McCoist was out on gardening leave. Fast forward almost five months, and Rangers arrived here in far more ebullient spirits with a new boardroom regime installed and three successive victories under McCall’s command. That Hibs and Hearts were among the victims added to the sense of a substantial revival. In Dumfries, however, it felt more like a flashback to the bad old days of their campaign. Rangers were simply second-best all over the plastic pitch in Dumfries . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park .

Booked: Templeton, Moshni . Ref: Don Robertson . Att: 5,093 . Immense credit must go to Queens, who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play-off hopes. Under James Fowler, they are capable of bright, energetic football that delivered goals from Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly, as well an own goal from Lee Wallace. McCall, though, must have felt a twinge of despair. He has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift. That so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion. A first defeat of his six-game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion. The Ibrox outfit remain third behind Hibs on goal difference, albeit with a game still in hand. Radical improvement is once again required when they host Raith Rovers on Sunday. Queens will face Falkirk at that same time, having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play-off spot.

The Office for National Statistics study suggests thousands of so-called 'boomerang pensioners' are returning to employment for financial reasons or because they miss working. Retirees are returning to work in their droves as many seek to boost their pension income, figures suggest . More than a third of those who had come back to work were retired ten years previously. Women were even more likely to come out of retirement than men. Workers from Wales and the north of England were the most likely to return to work after not working in their late fifties and early sixties. Lisa Harris, of over-50s specialist firm Saga, said: 'News that older people are returning to work is good, however scratch below the surface and it reveals that for some this decision isn't always entirely driven by choice. 'Many older men and women may have had to retire to care for loved ones or to help look after their grandchildren. But when these caring responsibilities subside, many find they need to return to work either for financial reasons, or simply to keep themselves busy. 'In addition there will have been relatively large numbers of people who decided to retire early, but have found that the dream of retirement has failed to live up to their expectations, either financially or socially.' Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: 'For those that do return to work, more often than not the only jobs available are low-paid and part-time.' More than a third of those who had come back to work were retired ten years previously, figures show .

"Former footballer Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence which happened just days before he attempted suicide. The 35-year-old, who played for Leeds, Burnley and QPR, today admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted his Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner. Former footballer Clarke Carlisle has admitted failing to provide a sample when he was suspected of drink driving. Days after he was pulled over by police, he attempted suicide . Carlisle still bears the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January. The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman spoke clearly as he admitted the charges from the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London today. Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14. She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation. The court heard he was spotted by police 'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting another vehicle on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am. Prosecutor Zahid Hussain said the car was seen 'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'. When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added. The court was told that Carlisle did not blow long enough in the breathalyser when he was tested at the roadside to provide an adequate sample. Carlisle later said he fell into a spiral of decline after his contract as a TV football pundit was cancelled . He was taken to Islington police station but would not co-operate and said: 'Sergeant, I would like to speak to my counsel first.' The court was told that Carlisle had been involved in excess-drinking offences in 1999 and 2011. Krystelle Wass, defending, told the court: 'Two days after the incident Mr Carlisle attempted suicide, which is why matters have taken some time to come to court.' She said there were 'ongoing mental health issues'. The deputy district judge replied that she would order reports ahead of the next hearing as 'he is clearly in some trouble'. The deputy district judge told Carlisle that he would get credit for his early guilty plea but noted that he has a 'bad record'. Carlisle, who was released on unconditional bail. said 'Thank you, ma'am' as he stepped out of the dock.

Roger Federer beat Diego Schwartzman in straight sets to reach Indian Wells third round . Argentine Schwartzman was comfortably swept aside 6-4 6-2 by dominant Federer in California . Federer hardly broke sweat in progressing and will now face Andrea Seppi in the next round . And Federer feels his decision to not just 'chase money or more tournament victories' over the years has allowed him to stay competitive. 'The idea was always (about) trying to be around the game for a long time,' he said. 'And for that in 2004, when I became world No. 1, I took a decision with my fitness coach at the time that we're going to plan long-term. Whatever we will do, we will plan long-term. 'Sure, we can chase money or more tournament victories. We can play more frequently, train harder, whatever we will do. But we decided we will try to stay around 20 tournaments during the year, which is a lower number.' Ominously for his rivals Federer believes such an approach has led to him playing some of the best tennis of his career.

Against Schwartzman, Federer was as impressive as ever - utilising his net skills to win 13 of 14 points, hit eight aces and faced no break points during the rapid win.

"As five years as Prime Minister David Cameron should have a decent stock of anecdotes to keep a room of voters entertained. But in an advert break for last night's TV election contest the Tory leader took the chance to perform his own party trick. In front of more than 100 voters and studio crew, he recited a verse from his favourite childhood song: Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West). Scroll down for video . David Cameron revealed the only song he knows the words to is Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West), before reciting the first verse . Initial reports that the Prime Minister had burst into song were disappointingly wide of the mark. During a break he told Sky News presenter Kay Burley how the chart-topping song by Benny Hill was the only one he could sing in full. She tweeted: 'Just heard from PM that he can sing Ernie and nothing else...' The Premier could not be persuaded to showcase this talent, but did prove his love of the song by reciting the first verse. Burley added: 'He didn't sing but he did recite 'you could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground...' Mr Cameron's love of the song first emerged in 2006 when he appeared on Desert Island Discs and revealed it would be one of the songs he would take to the fictional island. 'This really just reminds me of my childhood,' he said at the time. 'When you are asked to sing a song, this is, I'm afraid, the only song whose words I can remember.' The private rendition for the audience in last night's TV studio might explain why he got a relatively easy time from them when the cameras went live. While Mr Cameron was asked about treating the elderly with dignity and the depth of spending cuts, Mr Miliband faced a series of aggressive questions. Mr Cameron waves to the audience after taking questions in the first TV contest of the general election campaign . The Tory leader's first question from the audience was: 'What do you think are Ed Miliband's best qualities?' One of the few off-the-cuff questions from Burley to the PM was: 'Have you ever had three shredded wheat?' When Mr Miliband face the audience, he was first asked: 'You sound gloomy most of the time, are things really so bad?' Another asked: 'Do you not think that your brother would have done a better job? He was better qualified and better positioned.' Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband faced the wrath of voters - and Jeremy Paxman - last night as they were forced to defend their broken promises, judgement and ability to lead the country in the first prime-time TV contest of the general election. They were interviewed by Paxman for 18 minutes each, and also took questions from a studio audience with Ms Burley acting as moderator on the show broadcast on Sky News and Channel 4. This afternoon Ofcom had received 254 complaints - all of which were about perceived bias

"Brian O’Driscoll believes Roman Abramovich style investment is needed to turn English clubs back into a European force but admits that scrapping the salary cap would be dangerous. With the French league becoming a honeypot for billionaire financiers – comic book tycoon Mourad Boudjellal has used his chequebook to turn Toulon into double European champions – the gulf between clubs from the Aviva Premiership and the Top 14 is bigger than ever. Saracens are the only English team featuring in this weekend’s Champions Cup semi-finals and, with the west London side being major underdogs against Clermont Auvergne, Ireland legend O’Driscoll believes the domestic game needs to readdress the balance. Brian O’Driscoll believes huge investment is needed to turn English clubs back into a European force . O'Driscoll says it's a money issue for English sides and they need Roman Abramovich style investment . ‘When you walk about French dominance, the teams are coming from France but the players aren’t,’ said O’Driscoll. ‘It’s a money issue – players are not just moving to France for a tan. The English utopia is that each club gets a Roman Abramovich, who makes it their little pet. ‘Then they are able to extend salary caps and attract better players. That married with the best of the English academy players coming through – of course they’d then be competitive again. But certain English clubs are being squeezed and the cap is there to save them. Not many clubs are profitable and you have to be careful because the long-term picture could be trouble.’ While Toulon have flexed their financial muscles by recruiting international stars such as Brian Habana, Matt Giteau and Leigh Halfpenny, English clubs have found themselves priced out of the market for southern hemisphere superstars. The trend looks set to continue after the World Cup, with All Black trio Dan Carter, Ma’a Nonu and Conrad Smith among those already signed up by Top 14 clubs. Clermont, who face Saracens in Saint Etienne on Saturday, have an impressive raft of imports including Jonathan Davies, Zac Guildford and Napolioni Nalaga. The Massif Central outfit, according to O’Driscoll, are the best club to never have been crowned European champions and should be the favourites for the title. New Zealand's Dan Carter has already signed with Racing Metro for after this year's World Cup . Saracens (pictured training this week) are the only English team left in the Champions Cup . Among those expats is full-back Nick Abendanon, who shone in the quarter-final victory over Northampton. O’Driscoll believes that, along with Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage, the Englishman should feature in this year’s World Cup - calling for the RFU to activate the ‘exceptional circumstance’ clause geared towards overseas players. ‘From a player point of view: yes they should both be be picked,’ said BT Pundit O’Driscoll. ‘They are the players playing the best at the moment and you pick on form. But when you set out your stall early and you then have to backtrack a bit, I don’t know if you lose a bit of face. You create

"It's a classic Australian saying: 'G'day mate, how you going?'. But when one Australian traveller tried to get American's to repeat it, many were lost for words. Kieran Murray, from Brisbane in Queensland, recently spent months travelling across the US, and documented his interactions with locals all around the country. From a homeless man who was insistent upon telling his story about Britney Spears, to a man who insisted Murray was saying 'Get out of my nightgown', the filmmaker captured it all. Scroll down for video . Aussie filmmaker Kieran Murray has released the second installment of his hilarious series which asks Americans to attempt the Australian accent by saying 'G'day mate, how you going? One man in Austin, Texas (far right) was convinced Murray said 'Get out (of) my nightgown' This is the latest in a series of videos Murray put together one of which is based around the same topic, and another of which asks people to guess what common Australian expressions mean. 'I don't even know what he said!' exclaimed one Texan when asked by the Brisbane man to repeat the phrase. 'Say it again in English?', asked a man in Manhattan, New York. 'Sounds Chinese to me man,' he later added. Many people threw strange sideways glances at the man, trying to understand what he was saying, with one man declaring 'that's Spanish!'. Others erupted into fits of laughter as they tried to translate the classic Australian vernacular, and Murray also ran into one very talkative man intent on repeating he used to live in the back of Britney Spears' dads house. This New Yorker said 'sounds Chinese to me man', when speaking to the Brisbane man . One man in Nashville responded with an incomprehensible sentence while trying his hand at the Aussie accent . This man, who didn't quite get the gist of the question, was insistent on telling a story about Britney Spears . 'I lived in the back, of Britney Spears' dads house', the man, who appears to be homeless, told the filmaker over and over again. When he was asked again to repeat the phrase after Murray, he simply said: 'All right'. While on the subway Murray asked one man to repeat what he said, but he simply declared 'Can't do it'. 'I don't know what you said, were those words?' one woman, who appeared to be at a sporting event, asked the Australian. 'What the hell'd you say?' exclaimed one hog hunter in Texas. Kids giggled as they tried to understand what Murray was saying in his Australian accent . Many times the filmmaker was met with strange glances from confused Americans . Children weren't much better and translating the popular Aussie phrase, but the best of the bunch came from a shirtless man in Austin, Texas.

"The daughter of Chicago socialite Sheila Von Wiese-Mack accused of brutally murdering her mother during a Bali vacation will turn over a 'significant percentage' of her $1.3million trust fund to care for her newborn daughter. Vanessa Favia, attorney for 19-year-old Heather Mack, has filed court documents for her client agreeing to turn over funds for the care of four-month-old Stella. CBS reports the petition asks for around a half a million dollars to be transferred to Stella, who was born in Kerobakan Prison and who has urgent needs, including clothing and baby wipes. Scroll down for video . Child care: A US-based attorney for Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murdering her socialite mother in Bali, has filed for about half a million dollars to be transferred to Mack's daughter Stella from Mack's trust fund . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, in March . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . 'What ever your opinion of the adults in this case, I believe everyone would agree that the baby bears no culpability in this truly sad affair,' Favia said in a press release. Mack filed a claim in court back in February that her uncle, Wiese-Mack's brother and trustee of her estate, had blocked her access to the funds, according to NBC. A judge ordered $150,000 be released to pay for Mack's defense, along with another $2,240 for living expenses, but required that Mack not share the money with anyone. Indonesian officials accused Mack of helping her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, murder her mother at a luxury Bali hotel before stuffing her body in a suitcase last August. The pair are awaiting sentencing, with prosecutors having asked for a sentence of 15 years for Mack and 18 for Schaefer. Chief Prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya said Mack 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother,' but wanted her to be spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby.' The 21-year-old gazes at his baby daughter, held by a relative, before his sentence demand hearing .

As she waited in the cell, nervously puffing on a cigarette, Mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married 'in spirit.' She said: 'He has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison.' She held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring. 'Tommy's is blue,' she added.

"After supposedly inventing Mother's Day in his country four years ago, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has taken his unlikely stance on gender equality a step further. During a visit to an airbase yesterday, the despot hailed International Women's Day by handing out free make-up and sending congratulations to the wives of airmen in honour of the occasion. While not meeting any of the men's partners in person, he was said to have asked commanding officers to pass on his gifts of food and cosmetics. Unlikely feminist: Kim Jong-Un, pictured on a official airbase visit yesterday, is mobbed by female workers after publicly recognising International Women's Day . His recognition of gender rights comes one week after female defectors in Seoul claimed women in North Korea do not receive sex education, are subjected to forced abortions and in the military are required to perform sexual favours on high-ranking men, the Independent reports. North Korean paper Rodong Sinmun recently put forward the country's feminist credentials while criticising the 'discrimination against women workers protested in South Korea', who KCNA said were unable 'to live as human beings'. Meanwhile, KCNA's main report on the anniversary of 'Kim Jong-il's work and International Women's Day' said the country had 'demonstrated its might as an example of the progressive women's movement of the world under the wise guidance of peerlessly great men'. 'The Korean women's movement greets the heyday of its development as it is led by Marshal Kim Jong Un,' it added before hailing Kim as the inventor of 'Mother's Day, the first of its kind in Korean history' - four years ago. Airbase visit: The leader told airmen to congratulate their wives and also gave them gifts of make-up . Pearls of wisdom: The secretive despot appears to offer advice to kitchen workers at the airbase unit . As well as his nod to International Women's Day, the leader took the opportunity to heap praise on his late father Kim Jong-Il, noting his 'patriotism, faith, anti-imperialist class education and moral education', according to the Rodong Sinmun report. During the visit, the leader also demonstrated his green credentials after reportedly highlighting the need to develop wind, solar and geothermal energy to solve electricity problems. Much of North Korea's 24 million population experience power cuts every day. Inspecting facilities: During the tour, Kim inspected a new power station and also took the opportunity to tour the site's training facilities as well its washroom, kitchen, greenhouse and mushroom cultivation room . Green stance: Kim reportedly also highlighted the need to develop wind, solar and geothermal energy to solve electricity problems during a speech . The leader and his entourage are said to have flown to the site in his private plane - a Soviet-era IIyushin Il-62. His visit to the secretive state's air force unit was to inspect a new power station, but the leader also took the opportunity to tour the site's training facilities as well its washroom, kitchen, greenhouse and mushroom cultivation room.

"(CNN)It's the simplest possible assignment, but it always teaches a huge lesson. Every year, Denver teacher Kyle Schwartz passes out Post-it notes to her third grade students and asks them to complete the sentence, ""I wish my teacher knew ..."" Many of the students she teaches at Doull Elementary just wish they had something in common with her, that she knew soccer or video games. But sometimes, their wishes bring tears to her eyes, and offer a glimpse of painful struggles in their young lives. There's a student who misses her father: ""I haven't seen him in six years."" Another who wants to tell her she's lonely: ""I don't have friend to play with me."" Still another who wants to explain why her reading log goes unsigned: ""My mom is not around a lot."" And other who has big hopes for the future: ""I want to go to college."" The assignment sprang from the kinds of conversations teachers have all the time, Schwartz said: ""What do our students need? How can we best serve them?"" Schwartz always gives her students the option to write their names on their notes or remain anonymous; of sharing them only with her, or with the entire class. It surprises her how often students stand up and want to read their wishes out loud, like the shy student who shared, ""I wish my teacher knew I'm nervous all the time."" ""They feel respected, they feel safe enough to share some of these more sensitive ones,"" said Schwartz, who has been teaching for three years. ""Kids can share what they feel comfortable with."" Recently, Schwartz began to post some students' responses on Twitter using the hashtag #IWishMyTeacherKnew. It spread, as teachers around the country tried it with their own classrooms. They sometimes reveal what kids are most worried about right now, like the child whose mother was sick, or another who had just experienced bullying. One student just wants more attention from the teacher. Sometimes, they have a little fun: ""I wish my teacher knew how to do a backflip."" Occasionally, students want to reassure their teachers that that they're doing a great job. There's a lot for teachers to learn, too: ""They are KIDS who deal with a lot as they grow up,"" one educator posted on Twitter. Schwartz said she's learned not to assume what her students wish. Although most of the students at her school live in poverty, not every message is about a material need. There's no pressure to share something they're not ready to talk about, she said, and ""they're acutely aware of their own needs."" Through assignments like this, she is, too. As her idea spread, many Twitter users asked how they can help to support her students. She's pointed them toward a DonorsChoose.org fund where she posts a classroom project wish list. So far, most have been fulfilled.

"Tokyo (CNN)A bizarre and alarming discovery is raising concerns in Japan about the potential for terrorism involving drones. A drone carrying traces of a radioactive material was found on the rooftop of Japan's equivalent to the White House on Wednesday, police and government officials said. The discovery came on the same day a Japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima prefecture, more than four years after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many Japanese, who view nuclear energy as too dangerous. A staff member spotted the drone Wednesday morning on the roof of Abe's residence, Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. Dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone, which had four propeller and was 50 centimeters (20 inches) wide. Police say the drone was equipped with a small camera, smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium, a common byproduct of nuclear reactors. Cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown. Investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle. The amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the discovery is raising concerns about terrorism. ""There might be terrorism attempts in the future at the Olympics and G7 Summit using drones,"" Suga said. ""So we need to examine and review continuously the way small unmanned vehicles like drones should be operated and how to cope with the threat of terrorism from drones. The government will do all that we can to prevent terrorism."" Japanese law restricts drone flights around airports to prevent problems with aircraft, but there are no flight restrictions for most of Tokyo, including the Prime Minister's residence and local and federal government buildings. Abe was not in his office at the time. He is in Indonesia, attending the Asian-African Conference. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Joshua Berlinger and Josh Levs contributed to this report.

"Celtic have vowed to help John Guidetti contest an SFA charge after the compliance officer cited the striker for allegedly making an offensive comment on Dutch TV. Interviewed by a TV station in Holland, the former Feyenoord striker is said to have made a slur against Rangers while relating the words of a song Parkhead supporters sing in his honour. The Swede, who is on loan from Manchester City, is alleged to have breached disciplinary rule 73. He has until next Monday to reply to the charge with a principal hearing date scheduled for April 9. Celtic have vowed to support on loan striker John Guidetti after he was charged by the SFA . Celtic, however, voiced their astonishment that the matter had got this far, spokesperson saying: ‘We are very surprised and disappointed that this has even found its way to an SFA judicial panel. John Guidetti will be defending this charge.’ Meanwhile, the club has been hit with a combined £9,460 fine for two UEFA charges of misconduct during the second leg of last month’s Europa League showdown with Inter Milan in Italy. A penalty of £5,860 was imposed for ‘improper conduct’ on the field as well as a £3,600 punishment for flares set off by fans at the San Siro. Guidetti (left) is said to have made a slur about Rangers and has until Monday to appeal the charge . Defender Virgil van Dijk was sent off for two bookable offences, while five other players were booked in the 1-0 loss which saw Ronny Deila’s men eliminated 4-3 on aggregate. It’s the seventh time the club has been in hot water with the governing body in four years. Inter were also fined £3600 for their supporters letting off fireworks. Three flares were lit in the Celtic end during the Europa League clash with Inter Milan at the San Siro . Celtic responded to the latest fine in a statement which read: ‘Clearly, Celtic Football Club is disappointed by today’s decisions. ‘It should be noted that Celtic players have an excellent disciplinary record in European football over many years and in Scotland, Celtic has been top of the league’s disciplinary table for the last three years, something which we are rightly proud of. ‘Again, it is disappointing that the actions of one or two individuals within a support of well over 3,000, have let the club down by using flares at this match.’ Virgil van Dijk (third left) looks away as he is dismissed in the first half for Celtic against Inter last month .

"Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde has told Ireland not to expect the same Welsh mistakes made in Dublin last year. Ireland ran out convincing 26-3 winners when the two teams last met at the Aviva Stadium in February 2014 but McBryde admits the Welsh management could have prepared the side better for that contest. And, with Ireland's visit to the Millennium Stadium on March 14 shaping up to be the game that could decide the destiny of this year's RBS Six Nations title, McBryde insists Wales will be ready this time. Gordon D'Arcy surges through for Ireland as they beat Wales 26-3 in last year's tournament . Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde has told Ireland not to expect the same Welsh mistakes as last year . 'I know from a coaching point of view we looked at ourselves and weren't happy with the way we prepared for the game that week,' McBryde reflected on Wales' visit to Ireland 13 months ago. 'We did not have the intensity in training leading up to that match and we were exposed on the day. 'We weren't pointing fingers, we were looking at ourselves as to how we could have prepared better for that game. 'It was a bitter pill to swallow because we were well-beaten and it was the first time in a long time that had happened to us. 'We really struggled to cope with their driving game but we've worked worked hard in that area and the boys showed against France what they're capable of doing.' Wales' 20-13 victory in Paris has revived Welsh hopes of doing what they did in 2013, namely becoming Six Nations champions after losing their first game in the tournament and they were boosted on Friday when skipper Sam Warburton and Dan Biggar returned to training after suffering knocks in France. Wales captain Sam Warburton (centre) is expected to play against Ireland after suffering a knock . But Ireland are three-fifths to a Grand Slam having beaten England in Dublin last weekend and McBryde accepts Wales face a big challenge to record their first win over the men in green since 2012. 'They're a very formidable outfit as they've proven,' McBryde said. 'You've got to have your wits about you playing them in regards to the tactical and technical approach to the game. 'But the France game was a reflection of what the players have been doing in training and some of the execution and accuracy under pressure which we we speak about constantly came to fruition. 'We've set the standard and now we've got to do it again.'Â .

"Beaming towards the camera as a toothy 10-year-old, Carl Thompson is the picture of health as he poses in his family's back garden. But more than 20 years later the once rosy-cheeked boy is facing death after ballooning to 65 stone to become Britain's fattest man. Consuming 10,000 calories-a-day by gorging on takeaways and whole loaves of bread, the 32-year-old is too heavy to walk or wash himself. He is confined to the ground floor flat where he lives alone in Dover, Kent, kept company by a team of NHS carers who come to bathe him and cook for him every day. Scroll down for video . Carl Thompson, 32, has gained an astonishing 30 stone in just three years and is now bed-bound at 65 stone . Mr Thompson said he has always had problems with food and was even caught raiding neighbours fridges when he was three (left). But aged around 10 he was a normal size and played like a normal child . Living off a combination of incapacity benefits and a disability allowance, Mr Thompson spends roughly £200 every week on takeaways and online food shopping. He has not had a job since he was 17 when he worked in a food factory. At the time Mr Thompson said he ate everything the factory didn't sell. But after the death of his mother in 2012 from a brain tumour, Mr Thompson turned to food as a means of coping with his grief. Breakfast: Four sausages, five fried eggs, fried bread, mushrooms fried in butter, bowl of cereal with full fat milk . Lunch: Bowl of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate . Dinner: Chinese or Indian takeaway of up to £25 five nights a week . Snacks: £10 a day on Yorkie bars . With food as his only source of comfort, he doubled in weight from 30 to 65 stone in just three years and became housebound. 'That’s how I put all this weight on. I was very close to my mum,' he said speaking of his mother. 'She was fantastic, and I still haven’t got over it.' Now his days normally begin with a fry-up breakfast of four sausages, five fried eggs, a pan-full of mushrooms and fried bread. Lunch can be a bowlful of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate and dinner a takeaway. Since he is unable to leave the house Mr Thompson relies on online shopping deliveries and takeaways. His carers prepare meals with the ingredients he has bought. 'I order takeaways five nights a week, usually spending between £10 and £25 on Chinese, curries, pizza or fish and chips,' he said. 'My carers cook my food during he day and it's always microwaved meals - my favourite is chicken curry.' Alongside takeaways Mr Thompson spends £10 a day on chocolate, typically Yorkie bars.

"A child victim who was beaten and sexually abused for years by their father has defended their mother and the man's second wife for their alleged roles in the sickening pedophile ring where incest and bestiality was discovered. Christopher Sena, 47, his wife Deborah Sena, 50, and ex-wife Terrie Sena have been accused of abusing at least eight children over 13 years in their Las Vegas trailer-park home. The three allegedly took part in underage, incestuous video-taped sex attacks and were arrested last year. Terrie Sena, 43, agreed to a plea deal in January with Clark County prosecutors on one count of sexual assault that could put her behind bars for 10 years to life. Scroll down for video . Terrie Sena, 43, (pictured left) agreed to a plea deal for taking part in incestuous video-taped sex attacks with her ex-husband and his second wife, Deborah (right). A former child victim of the pedophile ring has defended the two women . Deborah Sena was offered the same deal, but her attorney said she was a victim and her husband made her take part. Her defense attorney, Kristina Wildeveld, told the Review-Journal: 'She was coerced, threatened, blackmailed, beaten, by Chris Sena. 'I'm very uncomfortable with a victim of domestic violence signing up for 10 to life in prison for something that she never was an active participant in.' The statement was seconded by a victim of the sickening sexual abuse, who is now an adult. In a letter to the Las Vegas Review-Journal this week, the victim said the mothers should not face jail because they were also subjected to years of torture and sexual abuse. The victim said the women, like the child victims, lived in constant fear and were monitored 24/7 by Sena, under threats of violence. Christopher Sena has been accused of sexually abusing his children and filming them in sickening acts for more than ten years . The letter read: 'Christopher would ask them if (Deborah or Terrie Sena) would like to take the punishment instead of us. 'And they would take those beatings for us.' The victim also added in the letter: 'Our father is in jail, where he belongs. 'And the absence of our mothers continues to victimize us kids.' Christopher Sena was arrested in September as part of a SWAT team operation and recording equipment seized from the home. Authorities allegedly found footage of Deborah Sena, who left her husband last August and reported the abuse, involved in sexual acts with the family dog. She claimed her husband told her she would do what he wanted if she loved him. One of the seized recordings also allegedly shows two children having sex with the family dog,The Daily Beast reported. Sena faces 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse. Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison. The 47-year-old is due in court for a preliminary hearing in April. The women, who were arrested on December 11, together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor

"His primary job is to keep opposition strikers at bay, but that hasn't stopped John Terry from showing them the art of finishing too. The Chelsea captain scored his side's second goal in their 3-1 win away at Leicester on Wednesday night - as the Blues close in on their fourth Premier League title. The 34-year-old's close-range effort took his tally for the season to seven in all competitions - making him the club's joint third-highest goalscorer. John Terry was on hand to prod home from close range against Leicester on Wednesday night . Terry's strike at the King Power Stadium was his seventh goal in all competitions for Chelsea this season . Terry sits alongside strikers Loic Remy and Didier Drogba with seven goals apiece as well as attacking midfielder Oscar. Only star striker Diego Costa (20 goals) and PFA Player of the Year Eden Hazard (18) have more for Jose Mourinho's side this campaign. The centre back's ability to score is a skill that compares him favourably to the firepower among other teams in and around the top seven of the table. At Manchester City, former Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard also has seven goals in all competitions this season - but Terry has fared better than forwards Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic who have only found the back of the net six and five times respectively. On the other side of Manchester, much has been made of the malaise of on loan United striker Radamel Falcao. The 29-year-old has endured a tough season in England and this has been reflected by his poor tally of four goals in all competitions. Terry's goal return is better than Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko - who has six goals for the season . Radamel Falcao has endured a difficult season on loan at Manchester United - scoring only four goals . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has scored only one more goal than Terry this season . Liverpool forward Mario Balotelli (left) and Tottenham's Roberto Soldado have both struggled in front of goal . Danny Welbeck, who left United for Arsenal last summer, hasn't fared much better too - having scored eight goals in all competitions for the Gunners. North London rivals Tottenham have relied heavily upon on the goals of Harry Kane and without his productivity Mauricio Pochettino would have had to call upon four-goal man Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor who has only scored twice. Liverpool's struggle for goals has been highlighted by the fact that Raheem Sterling has been deployed in attack by manager Brendan Rodgers this season. First-choice forward Daniel Sturridge has scored only five goals in a campaign which has been beset by injuries. Coupled with that, summer signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have failed to replace the void left by Luis Suarez - with the pair having scored four and three goals apiece. Terry's impressive goal return is even impressive when you look at the figures of Lambert's former club Southampton, where Saints forward Graziano Pelle (15) is their only player to have scored more than

"An educational centre at Cambridge University nearly lost two 'irreplaceable' artefacts after they were taken by an oblivious tourist who thought they were souvenirs. The Japanese artefacts – a wooden plaque and replica school textbook – went missing from the Kaetsu Educational and Cultural Centre last Saturday as it hosted a Japan Day celebration. The replicas were loaned to the university from a museum in Japan, marking the first time they had ever been taken out of the country. Punt boats carry tourists on the river Cam past King's College at Cambridge University . Staff launched a search after they noticed the precious objects were missing. They eventually found the tourist who had mistaken the artefacts for souvenirs and returned them with an apology. University officials said the textbook is a replica of those used in Japanese schools during World War II. During the war residents of the island of Okinawa – a key battleground for Japanese and American forces – were forced to speak the Japanese language the rest of the country used, rather than their own dialect, for the purposes of unification. The Japanese artefacts were taken by a tourist during a Japan Day celebration at Cambridge University . As punishment, those who spoke their native tongue were forced to wear the wooden plaque around their neck. The artefacts are now being returned to the Peace Memorial Museum in Okinawa. Peter Roberts-Taira, the education centre's director, said he was relieved when he found out that the artefacts had been recovered. He said: ‘It's the first time these items have ever been out of Japan, so the museums themselves were taking a risk. University officials said they located the tourist and the artefacts were returned with an apology (file photo) ‘It was Saturday, right at the very end of the day when everyone was packing away that we realised they had gone. ‘One was a wooden plaque with some Japanese on it, the other was a maths book which children had in their classrooms.’ He added: ‘You wouldn't know they were valuable to look at, so maybe somebody just though they could take them. ‘The message went out wider to people who asked their friends, and apparently they discovered a friend of a friend had thought those things were possible to take away as souvenirs. ‘They are irreplaceable, if they are gone, they are gone forever. It's very, very special to have them at all.'

'What we have done, no one has attempted to do,' said lead author Arny Ferrando, who noted past studies showing trained dogs can reliably tell the difference between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. 'We have taken the next step by asking the dog to tell us whether or not cancer exists before the medical diagnostic system does. 'We wanted to see, can the doctor utilise the dog to help diagnose cancer?' Thyroid tumours, which occur in a gland in the neck, are relatively rare and usually diagnosed by taking a blood sample and testing its hormone levels. Frankie was trained to lie down when he could smell thyroid cancer in a sample of urine and turn away if it was clean. Thyroid tumours (artist's illustration right), which occur in a gland in the neck, are relatively rare and usually diagnosed by taking a blood sample and testing its hormone levels . 'Detecting and diagnosing thyroid cancer can be difficult, because it's often looking for a very small number of occurrences in a very large background of benign nodules,' said Dr Donald Bodenner at the University of Arkansas. 'It is also difficult to say with certainty that a patient is cancer-free after surgery.' Dogs, however, can sense it as their ability to smell is 10 times better than that of humans. The researchers now want to see if Frankie, and other dogs, could be used as a diagnostic test for different types of cancer. Cancer Research UK told the BBC that using dogs would be impractical. However, it added that discovering the chemicals the dogs can smell could lead to better tests. Researchers at the University of Arkansas said Frankie only made two false positives and two incorrect 'all-clear' diagnoses. He is pictured here. Pictured is Dr Arny Ferrando, who found Frankie as a stray . 'Having a technique with which to do these things with a higher degree of certainty would be a tremendous advance in thyroid cancer,' said Dr Bodenner. The implications could be tremendous, the researchers said, both in terms of cost savings in diagnoses and especially the prevention of unnecessary surgeries. Additionally, the method could be transported to under-served areas where traditional detection methods of biopsy and ultrasound are unavailable. The researchers believe

"It is a cold, spring night in the heart of Liverpool at a football ground bordering Huyton, where Steven Gerrard grew up, so Paul Scholes is in unfamiliar territory. But he is reluctant to leave. Most of the rest of his party have gone but he lingers as the final minutes are played out, with the score 0-0. It has been a frustrating night for Salford City, the club Scholes co-owns with former Manchester United team-mates Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt. A draw here at Prescot Cables means automatic promotion will become only an outside possibility. Gary Neville and Paul Scholes attending the Salford City game at home to Clitheroe Town on Saturday . (Left to right) Scholes, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs co-own the club with Gary Neville (not pictured) Salford are attacking the far end of the ground and the view is obscured but, with 90 seconds remaining, the ball breaks for substitute Gareth Seddon about 10 yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat. And even from Scholes’s long-distance view the ripple of net is immediately visible as the ball beats the keeper and Seddon turns away to celebrate. Scholes, too, punches the air, his face beaming as it once did when he scored a last-minute goal against Manchester City in April 2010. ‘We had to win,’ he says, a look of real relief in his eyes. This must compare to watching United in a title run-in. ‘It’s the same,’ he replies nonplussed, before reconsidering. ‘Tonight it has been worse.’ Seddon’s late goal set the wheels in motion for a fantastic run that has seen Salford win six on the bounce, their latest victory away at Burscough on Saturday. It takes them five points clear of Darlington, who have a game in hand, at the top of the Evo-Stik League First Division North (four tiers below the Football League). With one week to go promotion is well and truly in their hands. Win at home to Ossett Town on Saturday and they are up. Remarkably, Salford City are the team who have happened upon five of the biggest names in English football as owners. The former United players, otherwise known as the Class of ’92, are products of the Premier League era which has propelled the game into a celebrity culture. Here, though, they seem in their element and none more so than Scholes. Earlier Phil Neville was with him. ‘This is going to ruin my week, this is,’ he mutters as another chance is wasted. This is near the base of the football pyramid: clearly the players are a lot better than Sunday League footballers but the culture is closer to Hackney Marshes than Old Trafford. Scholes sits in one corner with a friend, while Phil Neville, across the table with his father, Neville, informs him that they will be pairing up with One Direction at a forthcoming Pro-Am Golf Day so Scholes might need a stylist to keep up appearances. Scholes pulls a face while the rest of the group laughs

"Sam Burgess starred for Bath as Mike Ford's men moved within one point of Aviva Premiership leaders Northampton with a five-try hammering of London Irish at the Rec. Burgess, playing only his second game at blindside flanker, claimed the man-of-the-match award and was among the try-scorers along with Leroy Houston, Jonathan Joseph, Matt Banahan and Semesa Rokoduguni. The Exiles were ahead at half-time thanks to Tom Court's try, but Bath were in imperious form in the second period and coasted to victory - Blair Cowan scored a late consolation for the visitors.

Chris Noakes registered the first points of the night for the visitors in the 16th minute following a powerful Exiles scrum. Ford added two more penalties to give Bath a comfortable 12-3 lead after 30 minutes of play. Noakes clawed back three points with a second penalty and the former Auckland Blues No 10 almost scored the first try of contest when he intercepted Houston's pass to sprint clear. Anthony Watson had other ideas, however, as the England flyer showed great pace to get back and bring down the Exiles playmaker. Bath winger Matt Banahan glides over for another five-pointer during a dominate second-half . The Exiles were not be denied before the break as ex-Ulster prop Court burrowed over from close range after great work from Guest and Topsy Ojo in the build-up. Noakes knocked over the conversion to give his side a 13-12 lead heading into the break. It took Bath just six minutes of the second half to get their act together, however, as Houston peeled off an untidy scrum to touch down, with Ford adding the conversion. Five minutes later, Joseph raced away to score from his own chip and collect after deft work by Houston and Francois Louw. Ford converted again to give Bath a 26-13 lead.

The third Bath try followed almost immediately as replacement lock Matt Garvey made a storming run into the visitors 22. From the ensuing ruck, the ball was moved swiftly to Kyle Eastmond whose long pass gave Banahan an easy route to the corner. This time Ford was wide with the conversion but the bonus point was wrapped up on the hour mark as Burgess touched down following a powerful driving maul from the home pack.

"The bi-racial granddaughter of a Nazi concentration camp leader has revealed the horrifying moment she discovered the truth about her ancestry after she was given up for adoption. Jennifer Teege was 38 when she came across a book in a Hamburg library written by her mother - a name she recognized - and learned that she was the granddaughter of SS Commander Amon Goeth, who was portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in the 1993 Oscar-winning movie 'Schindler's List'. 'It really turned my world upside down,' said Teege, now 44. She has now penned a book - due out next month - about the life-changing discovery and how her adoptive parents and therapist helped her find peace with who she was. Scroll down for video . Learning the truth: Jennifer Teege, pictured, has written a book that comes out this month about her soul-searching experience after she found out her grandfather led a concentration camp in Nazi Germany . Ancestor: When she was 38, she learned that her grandfather was SS Commander Amon Goeth (pictured left), who was portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in the 1993 Oscar-winning movie 'Schindler's List' (right) 'A Nazi gene doesn't exist,' she told People magazine. 'We can decide for ourselves who and what we want to be.' Teege was the result of a brief relationship between her German mother and Nigerian father; by the time she was born, her mother was in another relationship and she was given up for adoption. By the age of seven, she had been taken in to a foster family but she reconnected with her mother, Monika Hertwig, when she was 20. Her mother told her nothing of her ancestry. By nearly two decades later, she came across her mother's book, 'I Have To Love My Father, Don't I? The Life Story of Monika Goeth' and recognized the author as her mother. 'The moment I had that book in my hand, I knew it would give me so many answers,' she told People. She learned that her grandfather had ran a concentration camp in Plaszow, Poland in World War II. Family: Teege, who was adopted, made the discovery when she found a book about her biological mother, Monika Hertwig (pictured), in a library. She had had contact with her mother, who never told her the truth . Ancestors: Teege's mother Monika is pictured right in the 1940s with her own mother Ruth Irene Kalder, who had an affair with Goeth while working as a secretary in his factory . Goeth was known for shooting Jewish inmates for sport at the concentration camp and for training his large dogs to attack them, and was a central character in the film 'Schinder's List'. Compelling: Jennifer Teege has penned a book about the discovery, due out next month . The German industrialist Oskar Schindler saved more than 1,200 Jews by bribing Goeth and other Nazis to have them work in his factories rather than be sent for extermination in death camps. Goeth, who was known as the 'Butcher of Plaszow', was convicted as a war criminal and hanged

"Atlanta (CNN)A report on lab safety at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put together by a committee of external experts calls the agency's commitment to safety ""inconsistent and insufficient."" The report, which was completed in January but posted on the agency's website this week, also says ""laboratory safety training is inadequate."" The report was put together by an external group of 11 experts in biosafety, laboratory science and research. In the report, they say they are ""very concerned that the CDC is on the way to losing credibility."" The agency created the advisory group to improve lab safety in July in the wake of two mishaps and other issues that were uncovered through procedural reviews. One incident occurred in June when dozens of employees in a bioterrorism lab working with the deadly anthrax virus, were at risk because of a failure to properly follow sterilization techniques. The head of that lab resigned after the incident. This followed a May incident in which avian influenza samples, thought to not be dangerous, were unintentionally mixed with the deadly H5N1 influenza virus and then shipped to a USDA lab. Then in December, with the advisory group already working to reduce lab safety risks and improve the culture of safety, employees in the Ebola lab were potentially exposed to that virus when a technician mistakenly transported the wrong specimens from a high-level lab to a lower-level lab. Internal investigations were done after each incident, and various changes were recommended such as cameras being added to some labs and certificates being required to transfer samples from some labs, following the Ebola incident. The four-page report summarizes the groups findings and offers recommendations following visits to CDC labs, meetings with CDC staff and a survey about the laboratory safety culture at CDC. The report recommends all CDC labs go through an external review and accreditation process. They suggest the College of American Pathologists for clinical labs and the American Biological Safety Association for research labs. To that point, the committee says in the report, ""The CDC must not see itself as special. The internal controls and rules that the rest of the world works under also apply to CDC."" Other recommendations include: . -- Funding for lab safety programs and standardized training. -- Implementing risk assessments. -- Establishing a system of responsible science and accountability. -- Rewarding researchers who run safe labs. -- Hiring a director to oversee lab safety. In response to the recommendations, CDC Chief Operating Officer Sherri Berger said in a statement, ""It's critical that we continue to solicit feedback on how we can improve our operations, especially functions as critical as lab safety. We brought this group of external experts together over the summer to assist us with identifying and implementing solutions, of which many are already underway.""

"(CNN)Famed cosmologist Stephen Hawking has proved his comedy chops on shows like ""The Big Bang Theory,"" and now he's trying his hand at musicals.

"Dark tourism is on the rise, with perhaps the best example of such a phenomenon being the ever-increasing interest in Chernobyl as a holiday destination. April 26, 2016 marks the 30th anniversary of the explosion, which was one of the worst nuclear accidents that the world has ever seen. In recent years, visits to the nuclear explosion site have increased exponentially, with Kiev-based tour company, SoloEast, estimating that it takes approximately 10,000 tourists there each year. Scroll down for video . In recent years, the Chernobyl nuclear explosion site, and nearby ghost town of Pripyat, Ukraine, have seen an increase in tourist interest . In 1986, Reactor 4 in the Chernobyl power plant exploded, sending radioactive particles into the air above the city of Pripyat, north of Kiev. At the time, the area was part of the former Soviet Union, but is now Ukraine. The Exclusion Zone, a nearly 50kilometre (31-mile) radius of contamination, runs around the power plant, although levels have now returned to those which are safe for brief visits to the area. However, such visitations are highly regulated and permitted only as part of an organised private tour. However, visits to the 50-kilometre Exclusion Zone, a contamination radius guarded by security, are highly regulated . Several private tour companies offer packages to the Exclusion Zone, which in some cases even include overnight stays . Guests must provide documentation at several check points upon reaching the site via tour bus. Once there, visitors are banned from touching anything, eating or drinking any food or beverage that does not come from outside the zone, and are even warned against sitting on the ground. Needless to say, all discarded objects and property littered in and around the abandoned city must also remain. And exiting is likewise highly regulated, with several body scanners checking for high levels of radiation. Once inside, visitors are banned from touching any objects or digesting any food that does not come from outside the zone . However, day trips - and even overnight stays - are permitted, now that radiation levels have decreased in the years since the disaster, despite still being up to 10 times higher than normal levels. While the city of Pripyat, which was located just 3 km away from the reactor, remains empty to this day, some people do live in the nearby town of Chernobyl, which is about 15 km from the site. In fact, there's even an InterInform Agency Hotel in the zone, which caters to travellers interested in spending even more time in the area. And in the nearby village of Orane, SoloEast Travel offers accommodations for their overnight tours at the Countryside Cottage Chernobyl Hotel, a Western style dwelling located just 5 km from the Dityatky check point. SoloEast Travel, a Kiev-based tour operator, offers multi-day trips that include overnight stays at a cottage about 50 km from the site .

"(CNN)The man suspected of killing a deputy U.S. marshal at a motel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has died, Brittany Stewart in the East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office said Wednesday. The cause of death is pending autopsy, she said. Jamie Croom, 31, was wounded in a shootout with Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells. It can be one of the most dangerous tasks for a law enforcement officer: serving an arrest warrant to a fugitive murder suspect. When Wells tried to do that Tuesday, he lost his life.

Hylton said in a news release. ""The fugitive who killed Deputy Wells was extremely dangerous, wanted for double homicide and intentionally evaded justice. ... When a public servant dies in the line of duty, it is an immeasurable tragedy felt by all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Deputy Wells' family, friends and colleagues."" Officials would not elaborate on exactly what happened, but The Advocate newspaper in Baton Rouge said there was a shootout. Authorities said Croom shot and killed Wells at a Baton Rouge motel. Wells, 28, was based in Mississippi but was on temporary assignment in the Baton Rouge area, the Sun Herald newspaper said. He was married and came from a law enforcement family. Despite the risks, Wells loved his job. ""It was his passion,"" longtime friend Alex McGee told the paper. ""I tipped my hat to him because he knew the dangers and wanted to do the job anyway."" Croom, the suspect, was taken to a hospital after he was wounded, WAFB said. He was wanted in the shooting deaths of the two siblings in February and was also on probation for firearms charges. That double homicide stemmed from a feud over a loan made to one of the victim's relatives as well as an alleged break-in at the suspect's grandmother's house, Croom's older sister Latonia Croom Duncan told CNN. Duncan said the family reported threats and a shooting at her grandmother's house to police, but said there was never any follow-up. She said her brother called her the night of the homicides, which took place at a nightclub. ""He called me and said he loved me and that he'd be gone,"" Duncan said. ""He said he wasn't going back to jail. Before he'd go back to jail, he said, he'd rather be dead."" CNN's Devon M. Sayers, John Newsome, Sam Stringer and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.

"If Kim Kardashian has proven anything, it's that big bums are big business. Kim, who was officially crowned 'world's best bottom', sparked a new trend for 'bacials' - that's bottom facials - and caused a 45 per cent increase in bottom enhancing procedures over the last 12 months. And now, one high street store have created a pair of bottom-boosting jeans that promise to give you a derriere to rival the reality TV star. Debenhams has unveiled a £45 pair of bottom-boosting jeans designed by Jasper Conran. MailOnline's Hanna Flint pitted the enhancing jeans, right, against her regular jeans, left . Debenhams has jumped on the derriere enhancing bandwagon by giving customers the chance to enhance that all-important asset with a pair of £45 jeans. The new denims, designed by Jasper Conran, can add up to two extra inches to your derriere and have proved an instant success for the high-street chain. According to the store, the Shape Enhancing Jeans are said to be flying off the shelves, purchased by women looking for a more shapely figure. FEMAIL put the jeans to the test to see if they really can give you a pert posterior a la Kim or whether it's all just a clever gimmick. The new denims, right, can add up to two extra inches to your derriere compared to normal jeans, left, as modelled by 24-year-old Jenny Kershaw . Lucy Herring, 28, tested out her day-to-day jeans, left, against the bottom-boosting pair, right, which have heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve . The secret to the new jeans' success? A clever combination of cheek-enhancing cut, expert tailoring, and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve, promising to turn a shapeless bottom into rear of the year. Control panels at the front also claim to flatten the tummy to emphasise the effect, while the position of the darts in the denim promise to give a flattering hourglass effect. Debenhams also say the jeans give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear. Speaking about the jeans, a spokesperson for Debenhams said: 'Pictures of curvy famous women, from Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj, to Pippa Middleton and Carol Vorderman, have helped women with prominent rears realise they have a gorgeous fashionable asset to emphasise, rather than minimise. 'Of course it is a little more difficult for women with a slimmer, straight up and down silhouette. The only solution used to be an expensive gym membership and weeks of working out, but now buying a pair of shaping jeans can offer a wonderful, instant booty boost.' The jeans promise to give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear, which Bianca London, 25, tested out (left: regular jeans, right: bottom-boosting jeans) According to the store, the Shape Enhancing Jeans boost bottoms thanks to a clever combination of cheek-enhancing cut, expert tailoring, and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve . So what did our testers think? Jenny Kershaw and Bianca London were impressed.

Dortmund's ball-playing midfielder Gundogan has been watched extensively by United and has emerged as their primary target. Van Gaal has an intrinsic knowledge of the Bundesliga and believes the 24-year-old has the ability to take over from Carrick on a long-term basis. Carrick, who recently signed a new 12 month extension, will continue to be part of Van Gaal's plans next season - but the club are planning for life without him. Louis van Gaal believes the midfielder is the perfect replacement for current midfielder Michael Carrick . Van Gaal has been hugely impressed with Carrick's contribution at Old Trafford this season. The England international's passing range and ability to dictate the pace of a match has been a key feature for United this season. But at the age of 33, the Dutchman knows the midfielder is in the twilight of his career, while the amount of time Carrick has spent injured this season is also a worry. Gundogan vies for the ball with Hannover ace Horoshi Kiyotake at Signal Iduna Park .

"Boasting nothing more than an empty, concrete shell on the top level, the 'Aurora' Soul penthouse has sold for $7 million to property tycoon, Tony Fung. The aim of stripping the property for the sale was to attract a buyer who can stamp their personality on it. The gamble worked. Mr Fung had to beat six other bidders to buy the massive four-floor apartment on the Gold Coast. The apartment with its own opulent pool, luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque, became Australia's most expensive penthouse, in 2006 when an agreement was reached to sell it for nearly $17 million. But the deal with Brisbane businessman Charlie Caltabiano fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute. Since then, the penthouse has been stripped of every piece of furniture, every fitting, the walls, the ceiling and even the kitchen sink. Scroll down for video . Gutted. The living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance, all fittings and furnishings have been removed, even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the Gold Coast, though, is still the same . The previous fit-out is long gone as the Soul Penthouse prepares to go under the hammer . The Soul Penthouse is one of the stand-out buildings along the Gold Coast skyline . The 63-year-old Hong Kong businessman is no foreigner to expanses in need of some love. He is planning to develop an $8.15 billion 'Aquis' casino and resort in Yorkey's Knob, Cairns, causing much controversy among locals. McGrath agent James Ledgerwood told The Courier Mail that this high profile buyer will attract a lot of attention to the Soul building. 'Given the new owner and his expectations, it's safe to say it will become one of the icons of penthouses in Australia.' Ledgerwood also added that spaces like this one are unique due to their versatility. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' James Ledgerwood admitted. The interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting Mr Fung's personal touch . Today: The bare bones living area. 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we stripped it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too' Mr Ledgerwood of selling agents McGrath told Daily Mail Australia . 'It's similar to buying a vacant house lot, but 220 metres up in the sky and with the highest swimming pool in Queensland,' he said. A spokesperson for Mr. Fung said that he was ecstatic with the recent purchase. 'It is a vote of confidence in the Queensland economy and an important addition to his property holdings in the state,' he said. Fung already owns 447 hectares worth of properties in the Gold Coast hinterland as well as an Innisfail farm, a private golf course in Noosa and he purchased Casino Canberra in December. Agent James Legerwood had previously told Daily Mail Australia that this property was a rare gem, particularly on the Gold Coast in Australia. He and co-partner John

"An Indonesian woman accused of ordering the murder of her wealthy Australian husband is claiming to be of another religion so she won't lose her inheritance, a lawyer says. Noor Ellis, 45, is facing charges carrying the death penalty after allegedly paying her maid's boyfriend to kill Robert Ellis, 60. The successful businessman's body was found in a Bali rice field in October 2014. Ellis told police her husband had neglected her and was denying her money she was entitled to - a claim that shocked family and friends who knew the couple. British man Robert Kelvin Ellis (left), here with wife Noor Ellis (right) was found in a rice paddock with his throat cut in October 2014 . 60-year-old Robert Ellis's (left) body was found wrapped in plastic with his wrists and feet bound and was dumped in a ditch in a rice field near Sedang Village. Sons Peter (centre) and John (right) now face the loss of their mother too if she gets the death penalty for their father's murder . The lawyer for their two sons, Any Aryani, says even as she faces the death penalty, Ellis is making moves to protect her inheritance. Ms Any says Ellis is now stating her religion is Hindu, even though official documents say she's Muslim. Under family law, which closely follows religious custom in Indonesia, if a Muslim woman is convicted of her husband's murder, she loses her rights to benefit from it. 'If Noor thinks ""I killed, I've been punished, but my inheritance rights remain"", well that's not possible,' Ms Any told AAP. 'We have prepared for that. 'As soon as the court states Noor is guilty of killing her husband, we will take legal measures that will ensure Noor will not get even the smallest bit of Bob's fortune.' Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids . If the suspects are found guilty of murder, they could face the death penalty . Ms Any says she's confident Mr Ellis's Perth-based sons Peter and John will be well provided for. The young men say they will support the court's decision if it sentences their mother to death for the crime, because they just want justice done. Peter Ellis learned about his father's death via the internet, and hopes to be better informed about the trial process as it continues. Police allege Noor Ellis paid a man known as Aril, the boyfriend of her maid, $A14,000 to kill Mr Ellis. They allege Aril and four others slashed Mr Ellis' throat in the kitchen of his villa while his wife was in another room. The trial last week heard from a friend of Noor Ellis who lent her the money to pay the killer. Police move Noor Ellis from her detention centre cell to an investigation room in the Crime Detectives Division of Bali Provincial Police on October 27 . Ellis has her handcuffs temporarily removed at Denpasar District Court in Bali on

"A Jetstar Airways flight was forced to return to Melbourne – causing a delay for passengers and crew – after one of the travellers was caught drinking and smoking on board. The Perth-bound flight turned around about an hour after take-off and the disruptive man was arrested after the plane was met by police officers early Sunday morning. An airline spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald that the unruly passenger has been banned from flying with Qantas and its subsidiaries, including Jetstar Airways. A flight attendant told passengers that the man was caught drinking his own booze on board the plane . A YouTube video captured by a passenger shows a man getting out of his seat as Australian Federal Police officers board the plane in Melbourne. One of the flight attendants tells passengers: ‘Ladies and gentlemen we do have security forces coming on board, we ask you to please remain seated, thank you.’ The man makes his own way to the front of the cabin, where he is met by the officers before being escorted off the plane. The flight attendant tells passengers that the man was drinking alcohol that he brought on board and was twice caught smoking on the plane. She added: ‘We carry jet fuel which is 10 times more volatile than car fuel, so for safety reasons [the flight turned around]’. The plane was forced to turn around over Gulf St Vincent, west of Adelaide, and return to Melbourne . The cross-country flight normally takes four hours to complete, but was forced to turn around over Gulf St Vincent, west of Adelaide.

"Comedian John Oliver couldn’t resist ridiculing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz over the introduction last week of his controversial ‘Race Together’ initiative. Schultz and the coffee chain have faced an avalanche of bad publicity and public derision over a well-intentioned initiative for its baristas to strike up a conversation about race relations in the U.S. with customers. ‘I think it’s pretty clear that no one has said “no” to this guy in 25 years,’ said Oliver as he could hardly contain his glee at the comedic material the announcement has created. Comedian John Oliver couldn’t resist ridiculing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Sunday over the introduction last week of his controversial ‘Race Together’ initiative . Speaking on his HBO show on Sunday, the British comedian said a conversation about race is ‘clearly important but there is a time and a place’ ‘But it is not the length of time it takes to whip up a tiramisu frappuccino,’ he joked. The campaign, announced on Tuesday, has received criticism that the company was using racial tensions to boost its bottom line, as it came in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. Others questioned how Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks. 'Still let's give Howard Schultz credit for starting a conversation across the racial divide with a white billionaire pitching an idea and any number of African American customers telling him how stupid it was,' said Oliver. One user tweeted: 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train.' ‘Hey how’s that conversation on race going Starbucks? Lots of fun right? What if this could be every morning?’ joked Oliver on his HBO show on Sunday . Another added: '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life 'white man's burden' crisis.' ‘Hey how’s that conversation on race going Starbucks? Lots of fun right? What if this could be every morning?’ joked Oliver. 'Nice try Starbucks. Now you can go back to what you do best – burning coffee and glaring at us for using your bathroom without buying anything.' 'Just stay in your lane!' In the face of the backlash, Starbucks announced over the weekend that baristas will no longer be encouraged to write 'Race Together' on customers' cups. The initiative ended on Sunday, but spokesperson Jim Olson denied that the phase out was a reaction to the push back the chain has received. 'Nothing is changing,' he said. 'It's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned.' In a statement on Sunday, Schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was 'just the catalyst' for a larger conversation . Ridiculed: After the campaign was announced, Twitter users slammed the idea as naive . In a statement on Sunday, Schultz acknowledged the naysayers and skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach. 'While there has been criticism of the initiative - and I know

"Our almost constant use of mobile phones and the decline of working class jobs are contributing to the erosion of the age-old whistle according to new research. Once heard constantly on the streets, in songs, on the stage and in the workplace it has nearly disappeared. Whistling aficionados are in agreement, no one is whistling while they work – or anywhere else for that matter. All children used to be told to whistle while they work by the classic Disney animation Snow White. However the rise of the mobile phone and music on the ipod means young people are less likely to whistle now. Cultural historian at Syracuse University, London, Chris Cook, told the Sunday Times that whistling has all but disappeared over the last few decades. A YouGov poll commissioned by the newspaper confirmed the trend illustrating that 70 percent of people were in agreement that they hear fewer people whistling compared with 20 or 30 years ago. Half of those asked said they believed the decline was a result of the demise of working class culture, while a third said they were listening to ipods and personal music players instead of whistling. Co-Author of 'A Brief History of Whistling' John Lucas said the sound of miners on their way to the pits or workers to and from the factories used to be common. He explained there were even whistling choirs on the buses on the way to work. In the 70s and 80s whistling was still popular in many pop songs, John Lennon's Jealous Guy, later covered by Bryan Ferry's Roxy Music in 1981 were well-liked whistling tunes . Paul Simon'a 1972 hit Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard is also well-known for its use of whistling . Monty Python's Always Look On the Bright Side of Life from the 1979 film the Life of Brian is one of the few tunes you might hear whistled . Lucas said other jobs also normally associated with whistling were gone. These included errand delivery boys, and the coalman. Where the jobs do exist, whistling does not appear to be appreciated. Kevin Gifford, a milkman from Leicestershire was handed a warning in 2013 after residents on his route complained that his whistling disturbed them. The slow fizzle of whistling's popularity has also been linked to the decline of variety shows. In the past whistlers could be incredibly popular. Ronnie Rondale from Islington, London was so successful that he became a best-selling artist with Columbia records and toured the world. However, the era of master whistlers is still not completely dead and Britain can still boast at least one. Seventy-year-old Sheila Harrod from Loughborough won the 1995 international whistling championship in Berlin and still performs 1940s-style variety shows at home and abroad. Mrs. Harrod explained that she began honing her whistling skills at the age of 13 but complained that now young people don't seem much interested in it. All of her audiences are at least over 40. In the 70s and 80s whistling was still popular in many pop songs, as Paul

"A $300,000 McLaren sports car was wrecked after a man's tractor trailer stalled and was plowed into by a train as it sat on the tracks. The driver of the truck heard a train coming and made out before his vehicle was hit. No one was injured in the Orange Park, Florida, crash on Friday. A McLaren MP4-12C, however, was heavily damaged. Ryan Fung was taking Jorg Bober's McLaren to a dealership near Orange Park, Florida, for warranty work when we got stuck on the railroad tracks . Though Fung escaped his truck when he heard the train coming, he couldn't save the car which was in a trailer in tow . Bober received a call from Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater, a McLaren dealership, who said his car had been totaled . Truck driver Ryan Fung frantically called 911 when we got stuck at the crossing. 'Yeah I'm stuck right across. The bars are coming down, and he's about to hit the truck,' he told the dispatcher. The dispatcher told Fung to get out of the truck as a train horn sounded in the background. Fung escaped the crash with about three minutes to spare but he was unable to save the car in tow, according to First Coast News. The car's owner, Dr Jorg Bober told Palm Beach Post that his car had been picked up by the company for warranty work when it got stuck on the tracks. 'My nurse called me up, she says ""Listen, take doctors Lake Drive the opposite way to college because there's a huge train accident"". I didn't think anything of it. Five minutes later I get a call from the company saying, ""Your car is totaled"". I was like ""Really? That's my car?"" the pediatrician said. Bober only found out about the accident from a nurse who told him to take an alternative route to work to miss the traffic . Bober's hoping that Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater will cover losses since it was being taken to their dealership . When asked about the accident Bober was in good spirts, saying he'd 'get another one' once the accident was sorted out . But Bober's resolution to the issue of having a totaled exotic car was simple. 'Eh, we'll get another one,' he told Palm Beach Post. Bober hopes Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater, the McLaren dealership where he bought the car, will cover the loss, according to WFLA. 'They've apologized, ya know. And as far as I'm concerned, that's what they can do right now. I mean, I'm actually pretty happy that no one got hurt,' he told WFLA. The area where the accident occurred has signs that read 'No Thru Trucks', meaning the truck driver should not have driven across the tracks. Florida Highway Patrol said the driver will be cited. Clay County Sheriff's Office, Florida Highway Patrol and Florida Department of Transportation were at the scene on Friday. Four trains transporting vehicles from Orlando to Louisville and two passenger Amtrak trains were affected or delayed from the crash. The area

"Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney enjoyed a night out with friends at a gay police ball after receiving a standing ovation for her tearful speech at the Ukip conference. Wearing a gold lamé skirt, high-necked black top and forest-green shrug she was seen arriving at the 'Fabulous Thirties' themed event at the Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone on Saturday. Just hours earlier she had read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide during her address at the annual Ukip meeting in Margate, Kent.

Ms Maloney completed her look for the evening with black heels, layered gold necklace, black handbag and understated make-up. The twice-married 61-year-old, who underwent surgery in November last year to make her face appear more feminine, is almost two years into her transition period to change gender. As a boxing promoter she helped Lennox Lewis to become world heavyweight champion. The longtime Ukip supporter was praised by Nigel Farage on Saturday as proof that his party was 'open to everyone'. Just hours earlier she had read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide during her address at the annual Ukip meeting in Margate, Kent . Ms Maloney also said she hoped to help people understand more about transsexual issues and added 'we are human beings too'. She was given a standing ovation after reading a poem from two children to their transsexual parent who had committed suicide. 'This poem I am going to read is a really personal poem for me and my family,' she said. 'Both my daughters and I met this brother and sister and my daughters feared they might have to do this at my funeral but we pulled through all our dark moments.' The audience broke into applause to show their support when Ms Maloney's voice started to crack during the reading. Wearing a gold lamé skirt, high-necked black top and forest-green shrug she was seen arriving at the 'Fabulous Thirties' themed event with friends . Ms Maloney started her speech by apologising for homophobic comments she made while standing to become London Mayor in 2004. At the time, the high-profile promoter said she would not campaign in Camden because there were 'too many gays'. Today, Ms Maloney said: 'I have learned to say sorry and apologise if I am wrong. 'I made a terrible mistake in 2004 when I made a derogatory remark about the gay community, and to them I apologise. 'I had to come to terms with myself and accept that I was a transsexual. It is something I hid and something I fought. 'I wanted to transition very quietly, but unfortunately

"David Cameron has vowed to build 200,000 homes for first-time buyers . More than 30,000 people have registered for cheap 'starter homes' - less than 48 hours after a new scheme was officially launched. David Cameron today announced plans to build 200,000 new homes which will be sold 20 per cent cheaper than the going rate for under 40s who haven't yet bought their own home. Since a website promoting the scheme was officially launched on Saturday there has been a 'stampede' of first-time buyers showing an interest, Downing Street said. The revelation comes after Mr Cameron promised to make cheap new homes for first time buyers the centre-piece of the Tory Party's house-building strategy after the election. He announced that a Conservative Government would build double the number of subsidised starter homes to give 'more young people the security of owning a home'. The homes will be sold below market rate and won't be 'snapped up by buy-to-let landlords', Mr Cameron said. He promised the homes will be 'decent, well-built, homes – places to start and raise a family'. The House Builder's Federation, which runs the Starter Homes website, confirmed that almost 31,000 people have registered to receive information on starter homes being built in their area. The federation's Steve Turner said the stampede of interest in the last 48 hours revealed the pent-up demand for first homes. He said: 'The volume of registrations clearly demonstrates the need for schemes to assist people to buy their own homes.' He added: 'In recent years it's been very difficult, particularly for first-time buyers, to realise their ambitions of home ownership. Government schemes to help them do so are clearly welcome.' David Cameron today promised to make cheap new homes for first time buyers the centre-piece of the Tory Party's house-building strategy after the election . The Prime Minister's pledge to build 200,000 new properties for first-time was one of five election promises to help home owners. He said the Tories would keep mortgage rates low, build more homes, extend the controversial help-to-buy scheme and encourage more people to buy their own council house. Local councils will also be given more power to stop unpopular developments, Mr Cameron said. The PM said: 'There is a particular kind of security that comes with owning your own home [but] too many people have been denied that security. 'The young people in their 20s and 30s still living with their parents, desperately saving for their own place. 'The couple who want a child but can't afford to upsize – even though they both have full-on, full-time jobs. It shouldn't be this way. 'Our goal is a Britain where everyone who works hard can have a home of their own.' Ed Miliband has promised to build 200,000 homes a year by 2020 - up from around 140,000 this year . But Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking at a People's Question Time in Hove today, said: 'David Cameron's plan on housing has failed Britain and failed families. 'Under this government we are building fewer homes than at any time

"Edinson Cavani's agent has talked up a potential switch to Manchester United this summer after admitting a move to England is a possibility. United are monitoring the Uruguayan striker's situation at Paris Saint-Germain, and Cavani was furious about being taken off against Marseille at the weekend.

'Edi is under contract at Paris Saint-Germain and there are several factors that come into play with respect to his future.' Once the situation is clarified there are several different scenarios given that players like him, at his level of maturity, are coveted by the biggest clubs in Europe. 'The market would seem to suggest Spain or England - we can't say at the present time that an Italian club could participate in the bidding for Cavani.

'However, we must remain alert to the developing situation at Milan and the recent change of ownership at Valencia.'

"It's been three weeks since Dan Osborne was heard threatening to stab his ex-girlfriend - and the mother of his one-year-old son Teddy - Megan Tomlin in an audio recording. But a second audio, handed over by Megan, 23, this week and released by The Sun On Sunday, hears the 23-year-old TOWIE star make another expletive-laden rant, threatening to end her life. Dan, who was arrested but released by Essex Police without charge after the last incident, also refers to his second child Ella, born last month with Jacqueline Jossa, as a 'mistake.' Scroll down for video . Recorded: A second audio recording has been released which hears TOWIE star Dan Osborne threatening his ex-girlfriend, and the mother of his child Teddy, during an expletive rant . Dan and Megan split in April 2013, shortly after the birth of Teddy, and the reality TV star then started dating EastEnders actress Jacqueline before announcing they were pregnant in August 2014. Now though, an audio-taped recording - heard by MailOnline and allegedly secretly taken by Megan last November at her home in front of their young son - sees Dan refer to her as his 'property' and threaten her if she moves on with another man. He is heard saying: 'I swear on this boy’s life I will end your f****** life if you shag another man. Never in your f****** life are you going to be with another man. I can swear on my son’s life.' Split: Dan Osborne and ex-girlfriend Megan Tomlin split in Aprul 2013 and have a one-year-old son together Teddy . 'Shut your f****** mouth you f****** c***. If you go near another man I promise you I will stab you in the f****** throat.' Dan made similar threats of physical violence in the first tape released earlier this month but in this latest release Megan can be heard exclaiming, 'Ow, get off me!' and tells Dan to stop 'hitting' her until she seems distressed and in tears. There is no proof that Dan actually hits Megan in the recording. After asking him to leave her house, he admits, 'Yes I am horrible when you go on about other men' telling her that as long as they have a son together, Megan is his 'property' Bouncing back: Following the release of the first audio recording, in which Dan was heard denying he was dating current girlfriend and the mother of his second child Jacqueline Jossa, Dan is now back in his relationship and expected back on TOWIE . Throwback: Megan and Dan are now the parents of Teddy, who is one year old . Dan can be heard telling Megan that she can't get a new boyfriend even though he's made another girl pregnant because that was a 'mistake' and he didn't 'mean' to get 22-year-old Jacqueline pregnant. Megan tells him that it's laughable because having a child doesn't get more permanent but he says things would be different if he 'actually wanted a family with [Jacqueline]' or if he was going to 'propose' to her. 'I don't care.

"A pledge to lift everyone except millionaires out of inheritance tax is to be revived by the Conservatives in their general election manifesto. Official forecasts suggest the number of families paying death duties will double over the next five years unless the current threshold of £325,000 is raised. Leaked Government documents suggest that the majority of estates currently liable would be lifted out of tax under plans drawn up for the Tories. The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Lib Dems . The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives proposed raising the threshold to £1million before the 2010 election, prompting the Labour government to allow married couples effectively to combine their allowances to £650,000. The Chancellor's plan to raise it further was killed off by the coalition with the Lib Dems, who insisted that raising the personal income tax allowance should take priority. David Cameron believes families who do not feel 'in any way mega-rich' are being dragged into the tax bracket, according to Government sources. One option is to create a new tax free band worth £175,000 per person on a family home, that could be transferred between married couples, making it worth a maximum of £350,000. The leaked documents show that by adding the existing maximum combined allowance for couples of £650,000 to the new maximum relief of £350,000, properties up to £1million would escape inheritance tax. The Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable (pictured) said the Tory plan was 'very cynical' The paper, written by officials for the Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke, notes the scheme will be 'very popular with the public'. 'It will allow you to say you are exempting those with modest homes from inheritance tax (with up to £1million of assets) exempted in certain circumstances,' the paper states. 'This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house, particularly in London and the South East, paying inheritance tax.' It estimates that by 2019-20, around 20,000 fewer estates a year would be liable for any inheritance tax. Critics of the duty say that money bequeathed at death has already been taxed, so should not face further charges. They also point out that the super-rich often employ accountants to devise trusts and exemptions to reduce their liability. The Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Tory plan was 'very cynical'. 'If taxes can be cut – and it's very difficult within the present budget constraint – we've got to start at the bottom with people on low pay, not at the top,' he said. A revival of the inheritance tax pledge would be another pitch to the 'grey vote' that could prove crucial in May's election. The policy was credited with a surge in support for the Conservatives in 2007, which helped scare Gordon Brown into abandoning plans for a snap election. Experts pointed out that the Treasury has suggested the inheritance

"(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the ""severe outbreak,"" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people ""who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,"" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there ""is not a lot to do."" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as ""a community activity,"" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for

"It may be another 149 days until England begin their World Cup campaign against Fiji at Twickenham, but England assistant coach Andy Farrell can already feel the excitement building across the country. Stuart Lancaster’s side will take on the South Sea Islanders in the World Cup curtain-raiser on September 18 at England HQ in a tournament that will encompass 48 matches spread across 44 days of action. ‘Rugby is going to be the sport of the year with the World Cup coming up,’ said Farrell. Andy Farrell says rugby union is going to be the sport of the year with the World Cup coming up in England . ‘It's as though the tournament is going to start in a few weeks’ time. If it’s already like it is now, I think we'll never have seen anything like it come World Cup time. The important thing on the back of that is obviously seizing the opportunity for the legacy after it. ‘I've absolutely no doubt that this is going to be the biggest World Cup ever. You go to places like Gloucester or Exeter; you see the buzz around the place because they know it's coming. It's going to be fantastic.’ England came within six points of claiming the RBS 6 Nations following their pulsating 55-35 victory against France on the final day of the championship – as Ireland secured a second successive title on points difference. It was the fourth consecutive time that England had finished second in the championship, but Farrell saw plenty of positives with international rookies like Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson and George Ford impressing throughout while established campaigners such as Ben Youngs and Billy Vunipola looked rejuvenated. ‘Coming into the World Cup, we're in a great place,’ Farrell explained. ‘There were a few injuries before the Six Nations and people got their opportunity. A lot of people took those opportunities. We're fortunate now that when we pick a 31-man squad; all these guys will have had some experience at international level. ‘Not just experience, but in pressure situations like the French game for example. We’re certainly going to have a squad full of people that can certainly cope in this environment.’ The England assistant coach says England are in great shape ahead of the tournament this summer . England will begin their preparations for the tournament with a two-week training camp at Pennyhill Park in early July. The squad will then embark on a trip to Colorado in Texas for a fortnight of high-intensity training at high-altitude before returning for three warm-up games against France (twice) and Ireland prior to the tournament. England must name a 31-man World Cup squad by August 31 and Farrell admits that some tough selection calls lay ahead. ‘The first train-on squad, we could pick up to 50 players. There'll be good players disappointed that they've not got into that squad! ‘Imagine taking it down to 31 - there's going to be a lot of players, good players, missing out on what is dream playing in a home World Cup so it's a

"When it comes to criss-crossing the globe by plane, it seems jet lag is the least of our worries. Whether you're suffering from dehydration due to low cabin humidity or suffering from pain in your ear canal during takeoff and landing, everything from oxygen deprivation to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell in the air. Here are some of the scariest health effects of flying... and some suggestions to prevent and combat them. Everything from dehydration to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell while in the air . Dehydration . While bodies are most comfortable at around 50 percent humidity, an aeroplane's cabin humidity can be as low as 10 per cent. That is drier than being in a desert. Naturally, this extreme dryness will only lead to only one inevitable conclusion: a very dehydrated traveller. According to NHS, the symptoms of dehydration include 'dizziness or light-headedness, headache, tiredness, dry mouth, lips and eyes, and the passing of small amounts of urine infrequently.' Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina and dry sinuses, nostrils and throat that make you far more prone to infection. Combat all of this by drinking plenty of water and keeping away from beverages with diuretic properties, like alcohol or coffee. Low humidity in cabin air means that passengers should keep diuretic beverages, like alcohol, to a minimum . Ear pain . Ever wondered exactly why you feel pain in your ears during takeoff and landing? It turns out that the uncomfortable feeling a product of the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure to build up within the ear canal. But it's only when this pressure cannot be released, such as due to blockage from a cold, for example, that the passenger will really be made aware of the change. Luckily, alleviating the pressure in most cases is relatively easy - simply by swallowing, chewing or yawning. Additionally, the motion sickness that you may feel in the pit of your stomach actually also starts in your inner ears, when your balance is thrown off by something like turbulence. Ear pain during take off and landing is due to the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure . In this instance, the best bet for preventing nausea is to book a seat over the wings, which is the steadiest part of the plane. And the final ear-related concern to contend with on board has to do with hearing. Whether watching a movie or listening to your iPod, the sounds you're blasting to block out engine noise and passenger chatter are probably wreaking a bit of havoc, since it's a different listening environment than you're used to with different levels of ambient noise to tune out. Although your hearing won't suffer any permanent damage after a plane ride or two, frequent fliers should take note of the decibel difference to avoid any sort of long-term effects. Lower levels of oxygen in the plane's pressurised air can cause light-headedness and shallow breathing . Oxygen deprivation . It may be a

"The Gilliam family were just trying to celebrate a birthday with a nice dinner out. But their night ended in tears when they had to rush their 2-year-old daughter Gabriela to the hospital drunk.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers accepts Champions League football is unlikely to return to Anfield next season, but insisted once again that contract rebel Raheem Sterling will do. This has been an uncomfortable week on Merseyside after the England forward's ill-advised interview only heightened speculation over his future. Sterling told the BBC that he turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal but insisted he was not a 'money-grabbing 20-year-old', while also admitting that links to Saturday's opponents Arsenal were 'quite flattering'. Raheem Sterling will still be a Liverpool player next season, insists Reds boss Brendan Rodgers . Sterling (left) started Liverpool's 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday despite going public over his club contract . Rodgers spoke to the forward about the week's events yet still started him at the Emirates Stadium, where the Gunners all but ended Liverpool's hopes of a top-four finish with a comfortable 4-1 win. 'The reaction and commitment of the players has been first class since (the defeat to Crystal Palace in November),' Rodgers said. 'Really, up until the Manchester United game we were the form team and playing very, very well. 'But we have been dealt two big blows in these last two games, we haven't performed how we would like and that has ultimately cost us in terms of the result. 'I very much doubt we will be in the top four now come the end of the season. There's too much ground to make up - that's the realistic view from me. 'Now, we must really focus on the FA Cup and that has got to be very, very important for us.' The 20-year-old (right) has turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal and put off talks until the summer . Liverpool take on Blackburn in a replay of their FA Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, when talk about Sterling will no doubt still be dominating the headlines. Rodgers is only interested on what is happening with the forward on the field, though, and wants another impressive performance from the England international at Ewood Park. 'There was no change in him,' he said of Sterling. 'I thought he was excellent today, our best player. 'He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, won the penalty and was very direct and strong, so I thought he was excellent today.' Rodgers was peppered with questions about Sterling in the post-match press conference, during which he said 'a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him'. Sterling (top) did win the visitors' penalty after he was fouled by Bellering (bottom) in the second half . The Liverpool manager was coy when asked about outside influences destabilising both club and player, but was forthright when it came to the forward's future. 'At 20 years of age - and just turned 20 in December - there is still a long way for him to go,' said Rodgers, who confirmed Mario Balotelli deemed himself unfit to travel after receiving a knock in training. 'He has got a lot of potential. I believe that potential he can really develop over

'Submissions and evidence were also presented by the tournament disciplinary officer. 'In upholding the citing complaint, the judicial officer determined that the offence was reckless and warranted a red card, and that it was at the low end (two weeks) of World Rugby's sanctions for offences of this nature. 'There were no aggravating factors, and he reduced the suspension by the maximum amount of one week due to the player's guilty plea, early expression of remorse, good conduct during the hearing and clean disciplinary record.'

"A man who tied up a cockerel in a trap and used it as live bait to lure foxes has been convicted of animal cruelty. The bird was found dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin after being tied up with nylon bailing twine for days. Nicholas Wells, 37, of Bedworth, had pleaded not guilty, blaming a burglar for the offence - which was discovered by RSPCA inspector Louise Labram last June - but was found guilty after an eight-hour trial. A man who tied a cockerel to a trap and used it as live bait to lure foxes has been convicted of cruelty. The bird was found dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin from being tied up . He appeared in court in Birmingham to face charges against the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 and the Animal Cruelty Act 2006. Recalling how she found the bird and came to its rescue, Ms Labram said: 'I found the cockerel in such a critical state that it wasn't able to stand. 'The bird was horrifyingly dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin from being tied up with nylon bailing twine for some days. 'I was just sickened to see the cockerel stuck desperately in a barbaric situation like this - completely vulnerable, defenceless, and in alien surroundings, just lying there waiting to die either slowly from dehydration or by being eaten by the fox that this trap was clearly set for.' Nicholas Wells, 37, of Bedworth, had pleaded not guilty, blaming a burglar for the offence - which was discovered by an RSPCA inspector last June - but was found guilty after an eight-hour trial in Birmingham . Wells admitted owning the trap but said that normally he would use eggs, cat food and dead chickens to catch foxes roaming around the area. He claimed that a burglar had brought the bantam cockerel and had placed it in the trap - but his argument was thrown out by the district judge. The court was told that the cockerel 'was very lucky to have pulled through from a terrible act of cruelty.' The bird had survived the ordeal and, according to the RSPCA inspector, 'is now living the happy, healthy life that he deserves.' Wells was found guilty of using a live bird as a decoy for the purpose of killing or taking a wild animal and causing unnecessary suffering to ananimal. He was fined £750 for each offence and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £75 and a contribution towards costs of £2,300.

"The woman whose secret life as a £300-an-hour call girl made her a fortune is suing her ex-boyfriend for libel - because he claims she was never a prostitute. Dr Brooke Magnanti, 39, whose diary of her adventures working as a high class escort was published anonymously under the pen name 'Belle de Jour', is reportedly suing on the grounds that the claim damages her reputation. Her blog told of her life as a struggling graduate in London and working as call girl to fund her studies - and included her former lover Owen Morris, known only as 'The Boy'. It led to two bestselling books and the successful Secret Diary Of A Call Girl series, starring Billie Piper. Scroll down for video .

The 39-year-old's blog spawned two bestselling books and an ITV series starring Billie Piper (left) But American-born Dr Magnanti has said she faced a backlash for glamourising prostitution after her identity was revealed. The books and series also led Mr Morris, a former RAF officer, to file a lawsuit in 2013 challenging Dr Magnanti's version of events. He claimed her stories were based on her sex life with him. But in what is likely a legal first, Dr Magnanti's legal team had launched a counter-claim at Edinburgh's Court of Sessions, VICE reported. They are set to argue that claiming she had never worked as a prostitute is defamatory.

Dr Brooke Magnanti's (pictured left, with Billie Piper) has filed a counter-claim to ex-lover Owen Morris's suit claiming her books were based on 'fantasy' Soon after their relationship ended in 2008, he claimed her books - The Intimate Adventures Of A London Call Girl, in 2005, and The Further Adventures Of A London Call Girl, in 2006 - were 'fantasy'. Writing on blog Sexonomics at the time, she said: 'I have no choice but to defend this. But am happy to do so even though it will almost certainly mean losing everything I have even when I win.' She took to her blog to vehemently deny his allegations, insists her blog and the resulting books are true.

"One of the Hillsborough samaritans sought by investigators has come forward after an appeal was launched to identify fans who tended to the wounded as they lay dying on the pitch at the 1989 disaster. The man was located after Operation Resolve launched the appeal on Thursday morning in the hope that the supporters might be able to supply crucial evidence for the ongoing inquest. Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy were released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner’s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal .

"Prosecutors have made Serbia's first arrests of people suspected of carrying out 1995's Srebrenica massacre - a significant milestone toward healing the wounds of Europe's worst civilian slaughter since World War II. Officers today arrested eight men accused of taking part in the murder of more than 1,000 Muslims at a warehouse near Srebrenica, a team of Serbian and Bosnian prosecutors told the AP. Altogether, more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed in the eastern enclave by the Serbs in 1995 - the only atrocity in Europe to be labeled a genocide by the UN since World War II. Serbian prosecutors said they initially arrested seven suspects in pre-dawn raids at different locations in Serbia this morning, then caught the eighth suspect following a manhunt later in the day. Horror: Pictured is the abandoned warehouse where over 1,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were murdered in July 1995. It remains the only atrocity in Europe to be labeled a genocide by the UN since World War II . Memorial: This photo shows the gravestone of Muriz Sinanovic - one of the 1,000 victims of the massacre . Chief Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic told the AP that all those arrested 'are former members of a special brigade of the Bosnian Serb police.' Serbia in the past has put on trial men who took a group of prisoners away from Srebrenica to be killed. And in 2011 it arrested Ratko Mladic - the warlord who masterminded the slaughter — and sent him to an international criminal court in The Hague, Netherlands. But today's arrests are Serbia's first attempt to bring to justice men who got their hands bloody in the killing machine known as the Srebrenica massacre 20 years ago this July. 'It is important to stress that this is the first time that our prosecutor's office is dealing with the mass killings of civilians and war prisoners in Srebrenica,' Bruno Vekaric, the lead Serb prosecutor in the case, said. He said Serbia was approaching a key moment in confronting its past. 'We have never dealt with a crime of such proportions,' said Vekaric, Serbia's deputy War Crimes Prosecutor. 'It is very important for Serbia to take a clear position toward Srebrenica through a court process.' Snows covers the area surrounding the now-abandoned warehouse where the massacre took place . Munira Subasic, head the Mothers of Srebrenica group, called the arrests 'good news.' 'It was time for Serbia to do something,' she said. 'This is a message to all criminals who fled and thought they are safe from justice that they can never rest.' The biggest arrest in the sweep was Nedeljko Milidragovic, the commander dubbed 'Nedjo the Butcher,' who went on to become a successful businessman in Serbia, the AP has learned. More than 100,000 people were killed and millions were left homeless in Bosnia's 1992-95 war when Bosnian Serbs, supported by neighboring Serbia, rebelled against Bosnia's declaration of independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia. The collaboration Wednesday by prosecutors from former wartime enemies Serbia and Bosnia — supported by

"Tim Farron, pictured, has vowed to bring the Lib Dem party 'back from the dead' Embattled Nick Clegg faced a dramatic leadership challenge last night after a top Lib Dem MP vowed to bring the party ‘back from the dead’. Former Lib Dem President Tim Farron savaged Deputy Prime Minister Clegg’s U-turn on university tuition fees and said the party had been ‘tarnished’ by the Coalition with David Cameron. Farron, a bitter Lib Dem foe of Clegg, said the party needed a tough new leader like ex-marine Paddy Ashdown who rescued it from a similar crisis in the 1980s. He said he had the ‘vision and never say die’ spirit needed to repair the slump in Lib Dem fortunes under Clegg. Left-winger Farron, hot favourite to succeed Clegg if, as expected, the Lib Dems flop in the Election, threw down the gauntlet in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. Clegg’s panicking allies have launched a ‘stop Farron’ campaign in a last-ditch attempt to stop him taking over after the Election. But speaking ahead of the party’s spring conference in Liverpool this weekend, Farron made it clear he is determined to replace Clegg. He brushed aside claims by the Clegg camp that he is a ‘sanctimonious, God-bothering, treacherous little s***’, compared Clegg’s leadership to the Lib Dems’ ‘near death’ in the 1980s and said voters would never forgive him for his tuition fees somersault. For a committed Christian, it is surprising how much hatred Farron generates among fellow top Lib Dems. There is no love lost between Farron and his main leadership rival, Minister and Clegg ally Norman Lamb. Clegg, Lamb and co swallowed their Lib Dem pride and principles, at least on occasion, for ministerial jobs and limos in the Coalition.Meanwhile, Farron, refused a Government post by Clegg, could grandstand from the sidelines, voting against the bedroom tax and tuition fees. Farron’s supporters in the Lib Dem sandal-wearing brigade say he is ‘untainted’ and see ‘Saint Tim’ as a saviour. He became a Christian at 18, when marooned in a house in rainy Singapore on a trip with his mum. ‘There was nothing to blinkin’ read and I read this weird-looking book on God. It was life-changing,’ he explains. Farron’s conversation is peppered with ‘blinkins’ and ‘bloomins’, adding to a boyish, Tintin cartoon air of wide-eyed enthusiasm. The book he stumbled on said the Bible was true. And from that moment, Tim believed every word. Literally. He thinks God knows everything. ‘Every hair on your head is numbered,’ he says, without blinking. God knows every hair on his head? ‘Yeah.’ Farron believes that Nick Clegg, pictured, blew the trust of the voters by his u-turn on tuition fees . Mr Farron, pictured, said neither of the two main parties should assume the Lib Dems will prop them up . He scoffs at the idea of a ‘half-baked distant God – either he created every bloomin’ atom in the entire universe or he didn’t’. He derides those who believe in ‘some kind of part-time, low-wattage God’.Similarly, he believes Heaven and Hell really

"A women's rights group has slammed a popular eatery for their latest advertising campaign which they claim objectifies women's bodies to sell beer. The Lowenbrau Keller, in Sydney's The Rocks, has released a social media and bus campaign featuring the slogan 'Wunderbra' underneath a photograph of a woman in a low-cut lederhosen holding a tray of beer steins. The same campaign also features an image of two women in a similar state of dress with the caption 'Make Mein A Dubbel', sparking outrage from Collective Shout, who claim the advertisements reinforces sexual objectification. Scroll down for video . Campaign group Collective Shout has slammed Sydney restaurant Lowenbrau Keller for an advertising campaign they claim sexually objectifies women . The Lowenbrau Keller campaign is being used on both social media and public transport platforms . 'Through this advertising Lowenbrau reinforces sexist attitudes and invites patrons to view female staff as sexual objects, exposing them to sexual harassment,' Melinda Liszewski, spokesperson for grassroots campaign movement Collective Shout, told Daily Mail Australia. '[The company's slogan] “Live it Large” and “Wunderbra” sends the message to an audience of all ages that women are to be valued for their body parts,' Ms Liszewski said. Ms Liszewski said that the 'Make Mein A Dubbel' advertisement also suggests that the two women shown are 'part of the menu'. Dan Hopkirk, Marketing Director for Urban Purveyor Groups who owns the Lowenbrau Keller, said that the advertisements were meant as 'fun play-on words' that people would be familiar with. '[The campaign was] designed as a portrayal of the typical Bavarian cultural experience enjoyed by millions during Oktoberfest in Munich every year, synonymous with this venue,' Mr Hopkirk said. 'The advertising slogans coupled with the imagery that has been used across the campaign, are popular anglicised German phrases which are fun play-on words,' he said. 'The Löwenbräu Keller campaign aims to embody the traditions of Oktoberfest which is about a celebratory occasion and enjoyable time spent with friends.' Ms Liszewski said that the Lowenbrau Keller, along with other establishments which the Urban Purveyor Group owns, including the Bavarian Bier Cafe, has a history of creating sexist and objectifying advertisements. 'A number of Lowenbrau advertisements make a direct comparison between the serving size of food and beverages and the size of women’s breasts,' she said. Ms Liszewski said that the advertisement also suggests that the two women shown are 'part of the menu' This images was tweeted from the restaurant's official Twitter account and posted to their Facebook page with the caption 'Is anybody suddenly thirsty?' The advertisements have garnered criticism from social media users who expressed their outrage over the allegedly objectifying images . 'This is explicitly spelt out via an ad on social media “Bigger is better - don’t you agree? We’ve got big biers, big meals and big…fun. #beer” and reinforced by outdoor advertisements.' The image, which shows a woman's chest next to steins of beer, was tweeted from the restaurant's official Twitter account, and was also posted to their Facebook page with the caption 'Is anyone else suddenly thirsty

"A northeast Ohio bridal store linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson has put its building up for sale after announcing plans to close. Miss Vinson, 30, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio in October. The store temporarily closed and was cleaned before reopening, but its owner, Anna Younker, said there was a lingering 'stigma' and business failed to bounce back. On Friday she announced on the shop's Facebook page that the bank has now cut off the business credit line, forcing her to sell the building for $338,000. Negative press: Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio, (above) which was linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson, is now up for sale after business failed to bounce back . Chain of events: Miss Vinson, 30, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas (pictured), was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting the shop in October . The store, located at 1220 E. Tallmadge Ave., is listed with Cutler Real Estate. Particulars describe it as a 'great 4,000 sq ft brick retail building, built in 1996 with eye-catching curb appeal. 'The space would be ideal for beauty shop, message facility, auto parts store, doctors/dentist office, day-care center or veterinarian with plenty of parking.' Younker, who has been in business for 30 years, said her shop became known as the 'Ebola store' after news of Vinson's visit hit the press. She claims that the temporary closure and canceled orders cost the store at least $100,000. The loss wasn't covered by her insurance because the plan excludes viral illnesses. Ms Younker told NewsNet5 that Miss Vinson, who was visiting her hometown for a few days to plan for her wedding, should have been more careful. Sanitisation process: The store temporarily closed and was cleaned before reopening, but its owner, Anna Younker, said there was a lingering 'stigma' and business failed to bounce back . 'I wish that now she knew better not to travel. The impact its had on me is huge,' the store owner said. 'Never in a million years did I expect something like this to cause our business to have to close.' Ms Younker said she was particularly offended when Miss Vinson asked for a $480 refund on her bridesmaid dresses. Miss Vinson, who recovered from Ebola nine days after treatment, asked that the shop refund her bridesmaids the $479.89 they paid for their dresses, via her attorney. Ms Younker said the refund request feel like 'a slap in the face'. In January she posted a message to customers on Facebook, announcing that her business would be closing down. 'Despite our best efforts, we simply have been unable to recover,' she wrote. 'The decision for me to close was not easy for me.

"Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness. After surgery, the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened, and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent, which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects – including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue – can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. But experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called EndoPredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500, although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the NHS. Surgeon Hemant Singhal said: 'I think there is a good case for the NHS to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy.' Professor Kefah Mokbel, consultant breast surgeon at St George's Hospital, London, said: 'With this test we can help patients make an informed choice, whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone.' Becca Cornford, a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11, six and four, was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence . She said: 'I dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy. I was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children.' Professor Mokbel operated on Becca in December at the Princess Grace Hospital, London, and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the EndoPredict. A low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds. 'I could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return,' she says. 'There is no treatment that places your chances at zero. But if you have regular monitoring, there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early.'

"(CNN)Two deputies involved in the fatal attempt to arrest Eric Harris in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have been reassigned because of threats against them and their families, Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Monday in a news conference. The deputies were trying to arrest Harris when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot him. Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, ""I'm losing my breath."" Police appear on video saying, ""F*ck your breath,"" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was ""very concerned"" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, ""Taser, Taser,"" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing . On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. ""We are sorry Eric was taken from you,"" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look. Harris' family has said the shooting reveals ""a deep-seated problem"" within the department and has demanded justice, and changes in policy.

"Jack Colback admits Newcastle United's supporters are being left short-changed as the club's sorry season threatens to plunge new depths. The 25-year-old says he is already looking forward to next term given the slump in form which has seen the Magpies lose five on the spin and score just one goal in eight hours. But before this season is out Colback and his team-mates will have to endure planned protests with a boycott of Sunday's match against Spurs set to see thousands stay away from St James’ Park. Jack Colback (left) says the Newcastle United fans deserve more following another disappointing defeat . Newcastle lost six in a row at the same stage 12 months ago and the atmosphere inside the ground was toxic during the final home game as fans targeted manager Alan Pardew and owner Mike Ashley. One year on and John Carver’s threadbare squad is in real danger of being sucked into a relegation scrap should their ruinous run continue. And Colback accepts that their current effort is far from the standard required. The midfielder was one of the only players who deserves credit this season and put in a shift against Liverpool . ‘This is a huge club which deserves more than it is getting at the moment,’ said the midfielder, who was part of another lacklustre display during Monday’s 2-0 defeat at Liverpool. ‘It’s a difficult situation we’re in – we’ve not got a lot of players. ‘But we can’t feel sorry for ourselves. We’ve got to make sure we perform this weekend. ‘If we play like we did in spells (at Liverpool) then we can pick up the wins we need to get this season out of the way and look to progress next year.’ Carver says Ashley has promised him that the squad will undergo major renovation work this summer. Moussa Sissoko was sent off for a terrible tackle on Lucas Leiva to add to John Carver's woes . The head coach has raised concerns about the character of the players after they lost a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby last weekend. But Colback said: ‘The character is there in the team, even though we didn’t show it last week (at Sunderland). ‘We had to show a reaction at Liverpool because last week was nowhere near good enough. ‘The minimum we could do is be better than the last game and I thought we were. ‘We should have done better with their first goal and it was a shame we took until then to react. We created the odd chance. ‘The penalty decision (Ayoze Perez was fouled by Dejan Lovren with the score at 1-0) was massive, it might have been a different game if we’d got that. Nothing seems to be going our way at the moment. Ayoze Perez (centre) was denied a stonewell penalty by under-fire referee Lee Mason in the first half . ‘But we’re not going to get any sympathy, we’ve still lost the game.’ Carver, meanwhile, will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save the season. The £6million

"Real Madrid’s La Liga and Champions League chances have been dealt a major blow with confirmation that Luka Modric could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. The Croatian midfielder pulled up in the second half against Malaga on Saturday and tests on Sunday confirmed a sprained ligament in his right knee with a recovery time of between five and six weeks. The news comes as the club wait to assess the full extent of Gareth Bale's calf injury, picked up in the same game.

Modric could still be back for the Champions League final but Real Madrid will have to get there without him.

It’s one year on from his dramatic winner in the Copa del Rey final but Bale, who also scored in the Champions League final and the World Club Cup last year, is likely to be in a race to get back before the Champions League semi-finals on 5-6 May should Real reach them. Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening . Real Madrid will have Karim Benzema back against Atletico so he will partner Crisitano Ronaldo up front with James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Isco plus whoever Ancelotti calls upon to replace Modric in a midfield four. German international Sami Khedira and former Real Sociedad player Asier Illaramendi are the options. Bale’s absence will be a massive blow for Ancelotti.

He scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax.’ And most Real Madrid supporters see Modric as even more important to the team.

"Friends of murdered Indiana University student Hannah Wilson have said she was last seen at the same bar where Lauren Spierer partied before she vanished in 2011. Wilson's body was found in rural Brown County, about 10 miles from the campus, on Friday morning after a night out. Daniel Messel, 49, was arrested hours later and has been charged in her death. Circumstances of her disappearance are 'eerily similar' to the case of 20-year-old Spierer, police told Fox59, and they will be looking into the case again. Spierer vanished after a night out at Kilroy's Sports Bar in Bloomington with a group of friends nearly four years ago. Her body has never been found and no criminal charges have ever been filed. 'Eerily similar': Student Hannah Wilson, left, was found murdered hours after leaving a bar in Bloomington, Indiana last week - nearly four years after Lauren Spierer, right, vanished after leaving the same bar . On Monday, Wilson's friends said she had been partying in downtown Bloomington and they were also going to go to Kilroy's Sports Bar, but deemed that she was too drunk to join them there. The group put Wilson into a taxi alone around 1am on Friday and gave the driver her address. Her body was found near Lake Lemon at around 8.30am. She died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to the county coroner, and preliminary results of an autopsy show she was struck three or four times in the back of the head with an object. Her only other injuries were superficial abrasions and bruises that the coroner said were protective, rather than defensive, wounds. 'Like trying to prevent her head from being hit,' he told The Herald-Times. Wilson was found fully clothed and there was no sign of sexual assault, police told Sky News. Toxicology reports for the woman will not be available for ten to 14 days. Police said they traced a cellphone found near Wilson's feet to Daniel Messel and after they arrested him, investigators found blood in his vehicle, according to a probable cause affidavit. Arrested: Daniel Messel, 49, has been arrested on suspicion of her murder. A cellphone that police traced back to Messel was found at Wilson's feet and investigators allegedly found blood inside his vehicle . Last seen: Her friends went to this bar in Bloomington but, thinking that Wilson was too drunk, put her in a taxi to go home. Spierer also spent time at the same bar before she vanished in 2011 . Messel's stepfather, Gerald Messel, told Fox59 that the man spoke of meeting a girl called 'Hannah' at bars near the university campus ahead of her death. Gerald Messel, who lives with his stepson, said he was surprised when the man failed to come home on Thursday evening and he failed to go to work the next day.

"Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor may have taken the spotlight over the past two weeks when it comes to the UFC's featherweight division, but this weekend it's time for two other top ranked 145ers to take centre stage, as No 1 ranked Chad Mendes and No 4 ranked Ricardo Lamas meet in Fairfax, in a bout which could potentially determine the next challenger to the title. Mendes' only two professional losses have come at the hands of the Brazilian king and Lamas also dropped a decision to Aldo when the two met in February last year. But it is Aldo's upcoming opponent, Irishman McGregor, who has dominated conversation in the lead up to this weekend's fight. Opponents Chad Mendes and Ricardo Lamas face off during the UFC weigh-in at the Patriot Center . Lamas holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym on in Fairfax, Virginia . 'I thought Aldo handled it well' said Team Alpha Male's Mendes, when asked about Aldo's reaction to McGregor snatching the championship belt on stage in Dublin. 'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued. 'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.' A stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event. Mendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre . Mendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield . Anticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo. 'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added. 'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens. 'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.' Mendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia . And Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims

"Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. Researchers have found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. A stock image is shown . The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. On a game reserve co-owned by Sean Hensman, three elephants passed the smell tests. Sniffing at buckets, they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. ‘They work it out very, very quickly,’ he said. Stephen Lee, head scientist at the US Army Research Office, which backed the study financially, said that elephants remember their training longer than dogs. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. This image shows an a warning sign in an area littered with explosives . Last summer, researchers confirmed that African elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom. Scientists from the University of Tokyo said elephants have the largest number of genes dedicated to smell of any mammal. They have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent - twice as many as dogs and five times as many as humans. Previous studies have shown that the animals have well-developed olfactory systems that include large olfactory bulbs and areas in the brain. They seem to be able to distinguish between two Kenyan ethnic groups—the Maasai, who spear elephants to demonstrate strength, and the Kamba, who pose little threat to the animals. The ability of elephants to detect explosives was first noticed in Angola - a country that many elephants had returned to after a 2002 peace deal ended a protracted war. While there was peace, the land remained sown with mine fields. Some elephants seemed to intentionally avoid them, though it might not have been a scent that kept them away - they could instead have associated those areas with danger because elephants had died there in the past. Researchers decided to investigate and in Bela-Bela, a town north of the South African capital of Pretoria, elephants named Shan, Mussina and Chishuru were administered smelling tests. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets, according to Ashadee Kay Miller, a zoology student at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. They only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive, which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper. In an experiment

"Researchers have completed the first comprehensive study of the microbes living on and in and uncontacted tribe from the Amazon. They say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us - and that the bacteria they found could be potentially beneficial to modern society. Researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the Amazonian region of South America. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are hunter-gatherers. They gather wild bananas, seasonal fruits, palm hearts and cassava. They hunt birds, small mammals, crabs, frogs, small fish and the occasional peccary, monkey or tapir. The group doesn't grow food or domesticate livestock. The researchers found that Yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. 'That tells us that Western diets and lifestyles have a great impact on our microbiomes', experts at University of San Diego said. 'Studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics, sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors,' said study co-author Rob Knight. In the new study published April 17 by Science Advances, researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. This information revealed, for the first time, the species of bacteria that co-exist with people who have never been exposed to industrialized society, including Western food and antibiotics. 'Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body,' the researchers wrote. Many Yanomami now regularly interact with Western civilization through trade, but some villages have never had contact with non-Yanomami people. One such unmapped village was first spotted by an army helicopter passing overhead in 2008. In 2009, a medical mission landed there. As part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered. The samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study. Yanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests . Thousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international. The Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade. The Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a

"A jealous transvestite who attacked the Polish wife of a man she fancied with her stiletto shoe is facing jail. Plagad Somian, 23, began hassling Marek Pietrzycka, 45, when she saw him walking with his wife Katarzyna in the street in Pattaya, a city on the east coast of Thailand known as a sex tourist hotspot. She reportedly told him to 'ditch the b**** and make the switch' which annoyed Mrs Pietrzycka, 42, who told Somian her husband was not interested before taking his hand and walking off. Katarzyne Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai transvestite jealous over her husband, leaving her bleeding heavily from her head (right) following the assault in the east coast Thai city of Pattaya . Transvestite Plagad Somian, 23, has been arrested over the incident after allegedly flying into a jealous rage . Mrs Pietrzycka is comforted in hospital after the horror attack. She and her husband were trying to walk away . But as the couple tried to leave the brunette sex worker flipped, taking off her shoe and striking Pietrzycka in the face, knocking her to the ground and screaming: 'Don't f***ing mess with me you ugly whore.' Fellow tourist Oliver Kolar, 33, told local TV: 'The ladyboy had been talking to the woman's husband and she obviously didn't like it. 'The blonde started telling the man they were leaving, and the next thing you knew the ladyboy went mental, took off her shoe and smashed it into the woman's face. 'She was swearing a lot and when she attacked, the blonde went down like a tonne of bricks and was lying on the floor with blood streaming down her face. 'The ladyboy then hit her again and that's when the man, who I assumed was her husband, pulled her off.' Police quickly arrived on the scene and arrested Somian, who was being calmed down by fellow transvestites. Local man Son-Ram Wonggoun, 42, said: 'Foreigners are quite vulnerable around here and there have been a few incidents where they have been robbed or ripped off. The Polish tourist was struck in the face and knocked to the ground while on holiday in Pattaya, Thailand . Somian is detained. She reportedly shouted 'ditch the b**** and make the switch' before launching the attack . 'But I have never seen anything like this. 'The local working girls and ladyboys are temperamental but are normally very good to tourists as that is their trade. 'Attacking one is bad news for everyone as it will give us a bad reputation. 'People won't come here and enjoy what's on offer if they feel threatened by the prospect of violence. 'It was clear that this blond lady was on holiday with her man for sightseeing and not there for the other stuff. 'The ladyboy should have stayed away.' A police spokesman said: 'She admitted attacking the woman but said she had done it in a fit of rage at being slighted. She said the Polish woman had insulted her.

"Amid a torrent of rumours surrounding Rafa Benitez and his managerial future, the Spaniard quietly continued a phenomenal career trend on Thursday with Napoli. He took the Serie A side into the Europa League semi-final with an emphatic 6-3 aggregate victory over Wolfsburg and the impending encounters against Dnipro will be Benitez's seventh major European semi-final in 12 seasons. Napoli are the fourth club he has taken to the latter stages of a European competition, following spells with Valencia, Liverpool and Chelsea.

That achievement, alongside the two La Liga titles he won during his three-year spell at the Mestalla, caught the eye of Liverpool, who swooped to bring the Spaniard in as Gerard Houllier's replacement. His first Premier League season was one of adjustment but in Europe, Benitez flourished. He recorded his most stunning glory to date, masterminding what on paper was a woefully uninspiring Liverpool team to Champions League glory, overcoming a star-studded AC Milan side that boasted the likes of Cafu, Paolo Maldini, Kaka and Andriy Shevchenko in the final. Benitez maneuvered Liverpool back to the Champions League final in 2007, eliminating Barcelona on the way with a win at the Nou Camp, only for Milan to avenge their defeat two years prior with a 2-1 victory. The Spaniard manipulated another assault on Europe's elite trophy the following year but Liverpool were knocked out in the semi-final by Chelsea. Off-field ownership turmoil derailed Benitez's team and Liverpool have not even threatened to emerge as a challenger for club football's most prestigious competition since. They were eliminated in the group stage of the tournament in 2010, where a third-placed finish resulted in demotion to the Europa League. But Benitez guided Liverpool to the semi-finals of Europe's secondary competition, where a Diego Forlan strike in extra-time at Anfield sent Atletico Madrid to the final, where they beat Roy Hodgson's Fulham. The Spaniard was sacked as Liverpool manager at the end of the 2010 season and Hodgson replaced Benitez, who ended up at Chelsea as interim manager in 2012 via a short spell at Inter Milan.

"It has famously been a showcase for fast cars, flash watches and high-class liquor - but the latest Bond instalment is set to go one step further by promoting an entire country for tax-breaks. The new movie, Spectre, will be a truly pro-Mexican affair with beautiful shots of the country, a leading role for one of the nation's most glamorous actress and a strict rule that Bond's nemesis is not from Mexico. In exchange for these considerable lengths, the Hollywood producers making the film, who are under pressure to cut their huge budget, will have an extra £14million to spend how they choose. Scroll down for video . Starring role: Glamorous Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman was recently unveiled as new Bond girl Estrella . The Central American country, where the iconic opening scene takes place, offered Hollywood producers a fortune as an incentive to film there, but their generosity came with conditions. Stephanie Sigman, one of Mexico's rising stars, was recently unveiled as Bond girl Estrella, appearing alongside Italian Monica Bellucci, who plays Lucia Sciarra. The Mexican actress, 27, is best known for her role in the award-winning Mexican film Miss Bala, in which she played a beauty queen forced to do a gang's dirty work after witnessing a murder. In addition, Mexico also asked that an assassination target in the film, the Mayor of Mexico City, be changed to an international leader, The Telegraph reports. Tax incentives: It is believed that Hollywood producers making the new Bond movie will save as much as £14million by showing Mexico in a favourable light . These measures are said to have secured tax breaks worth £10million. Around £4million was said to have been earned by filming flattering shots of the country's 'modern' skyline and replacing a cage fighting scene with footage of Mexico's renowned Day of the Dead festivities. Stephanie Sigman will be the first Mexican-born Bond girl on the big screen, but not the first overall. Mexico's Linda Christian - the original Bond girl - starred in the 1954 television adaptation of Casino Royale. The movie's alterations were reported by US website Tax Analysts, which provides information on tax news, based on emails leaked in last year's Sony hacking scandal. Large numbers of internal emails were released by Guardians of the Peace, which the FBI has since identified as a North Korean-backed group of hackers. According to the leaked emails Spectre's budget was at one point exceeding £200 million - which would have made it one of the most expensive films in history. Studio executives spoke of being under 'immense pressure' to reduce the budget. The plan to give Mexico a flattering portrayal was outlined in a memo titled 'Elements needed to preserve Mexican deal'. It spoke of how producers should cast a 'known Mexican actress' as Estrella and female villain Sciarra 'cannot be Mexican'. It also called for aerial shots of 'modern Mexico City buildings'. Rising star: Ms Sigman (pictured left in an advert for her hit Mexican film Miss Bala) will star alongside Daniel Craig and Italian actress Monica Bellucci, who

"Fewer families are taking holidays during term time in the wake of a government crackdown on absenteeism, new figures suggest. The number of days missed by holidaying pupils decreased by almost a third in the past year after a ban on taking children out of lessons for trips. Parents have been fined up to £1,000 and even taken to court since the new policy came into force in September 2013. Drop: Figures reveal just 3million school days were missed by pupils last year - down 1.4million on 2012-13 . Yesterday, Department for Education figures showed 3million days were missed for holidays in 2013-14, down from 4.4million in 2012-13. The latest figure represents a decrease of more than two fifths from 2009-10, when 5.3million days were missed. Government statisticians said the drop has been fuelled by a fall in the number of authorised breaks - trips approved by the school. There has been a slight rise in the number of unauthorised holidays - indicating that some parents may be deciding to take their child out of school without permission, and instead run the risk of a fine. The latest figures, for the last academic year, are the first to show the impact of strict new rules on pupil absence introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove. Under the changes, heads are now only able to grant leave in ‘exceptional circumstances’ and parents can be fined £60 per pupil for taking term time holidays without permission. The cost rises to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Fines: The drop is being credited on the new fines system, which sees parents landed with a £60 penalty if they take their children out of school for an 'unauthorised' absence . Those who fail to pay can face prosecution, with a maximum fine, if convicted, of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. The National Association of Head Teachers released guidance stating exceptions could be made for family funerals and religious events, but family holidays were unlikely to meet the criterion. Campaigners have said the rules impact the hardest on poorer families who cannot afford high travel costs during school breaks, and families with parents that work shifts on or rosters. Travel companies increase their prices significantly in peak seasons when there is more demand. School Reform Minister Nick Gibb said: ‘Every single lost day counts - which is why as part of our plan for education we have put teachers back in charge so they can clamp down on classroom absence. ‘Fewer school days are being lost than ever before thanks to our reforms - giving children the best possible chance to succeed.’

After 120 exhausting minutes Diego Simeone’s side won on penalties with Fernando Torres scoring the home side’s last spot-kick and Stefan Kiessling missing his to put Atletico through. The dramatic climax began with Raul Garcia blazing the first kick over the bar. Substitute goalkeeper Jan Oblak saved Hakan Calhanoglu’s awful spot-kick hit low and straight down the middle to put the Spaniards back in with a chance of progress.

Atletico came into the game one goal down from the first leg and struggled to make in-roads early on with a Koke free-kick not really testing Leno. Simone’s team knew one lapse on the break would need them leaving to score three and when Son Heugn-Min was put through by Bender on 22 minutes it was his miscontrol that prevented him getting a shot on target.

"(CNN)The best part of the Supreme Court oral arguments about marriage equality was when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg alluded to S&M. OK, she didn't actually mention S&M, but Ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago, when it was ""a dominant and a subordinate relationship."" ""Yes, it was marriage between a man and a woman, but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled,"" said Ginsburg. ""It was her obligation to follow him."" Mary Bonauto, the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same-sex couples who petitioned the Supreme Court, said in response: ""That's correct. ... For centuries we had and Europe had this coverture system where a woman's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles. And again, because of equality and changing social circumstances, all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated."" Once upon a time, wives were the legal property of their husbands and ""marital rape"" was not only not a crime but not even a concept. To argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully naïve. Justice Anthony Kennedy, widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines, at one point referred to ""the nobility and the sacredness of marriage."" Which is true, if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present. If anything, the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people. One downside to arguing that marriage has ""always been"" between a man and a woman is that, therefore, any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples, too. The one justice who didn't ask a question is Clarence Thomas, who, with one slight exception, has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench. It should be carefully noted here that Thomas is a black man married to a white woman. Anti-miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in Maryland. That means that by 1967, when the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of such laws, bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the American ""definition"" of marriage for over 300 years. Just 20 years after the Supreme Court struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states, Clarence Thomas and his wife, Virginia, were married. James Braxton Peterson, director of Africana Studies at Lehigh University, has written, ""The fact that the Thomas' marriage required progressive Supreme Court action must in some way inform their sense of this moment."" Or maybe not. Clarence Thomas didn't say one way or the other, though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he's firmly opposed to the Supreme Court doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own. But perhaps the example of Clarence Thomas speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments

Dossena, whose signing was seen as something of a coup for Orient, earned around £40,000-"

"(CNN)For Max, the passage of Indiana's new religious freedom law feels a lot like high school. Max is transgender. The 26-year-old was born a female but identifies as a man. That was a tough experience in Evansville: looking like a girl, everyone treating you like one, but not feeling at home in your skin. Classmates made fun of him. He withdrew. He and his parents fought. Now they don't talk. Making it to his mid-20s feels like a victory to him now, as does knowing that he has friends who support him, friends who are straight and gay and transgender. He had just gotten to a point of feeling accepted when the Indiana state legislature passed the Religious Freedom Act. ""This law makes me feel like I'm being bullied all over again,"" he said. ""If I go into a restaurant and the owner doesn't like me because I'm transgender, because their religion has told them that I'm bad, does that give them the right to refuse to serve me? Proponents of the law, including Gov. Mike Pence, say that's not what the law will do. He has said it's intended to prevent the government from forcing anyone to do something that opposes their religious beliefs. Some businesses and Indianans are behind him. Nationally influential Christian evangelist Franklin Graham, who lives in North Carolina, tweeted this week, ""Thank God for politicians like @GovPenceIN who are not afraid to take a stand regardless of political consequences."" But there is a tidal wave of opposition throughout the state and across the country. Critics say the law is a thinly veiled mechanism to legally sanction discrimination. Protests have raged throughout the state and elsewhere. Some religious leaders oppose it. Civic groups, corporations and state governments, such as Washington state and Connecticut, are vowing not to to do business with Indiana. The Indiana Chamber of Commerce has blasted the law. So has the N.C.A.A. Its college basketball tournament is hosting the Final Four in Indianapolis this weekend. Some businesses in the state are reacting by placing signs in windows that read, ""We serve everyone."" Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a vocal opponent of the law, demanded: ""Fix this law. ... Do so immediately."" He and others contend that because Indiana, unlike other states, has no statewide law protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination, this religious freedom law is a license to discriminate. Hundreds of protesters joined Max in a demonstration on the streets of Evansville Monday. Some said they would consider leaving the state because the law makes them feel unwelcome. Lee Flowers, 27, organized a rally in Evansville to protest the law. He grew up in Indiana, but now he's afraid to go into businesses with his boyfriend. ""This is very personal,"" he said. ""It hurts me. It really does. This is shameful for Indiana. Is anyone infringing on someone's religion? No. This is about giving people the legal defense to refuse business to someone they don't like based on sexual orientation."" Casey Samson of Samson Family Leather in Lebanon told CNN that he read the law,

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists keeping Kevin Mirallas happy is key to holding on to him in the summer. There has been plenty of speculation about the Belgium international and he even admitted himself in February he fancied a new challenge and had an ambition to play in the Champions League next season. Injuries have prevented the 27-year-old from really finding his best form this campaign with a run of consistent performances but Martinez was delighted to see him score his first Premier League goal since December 28 in last weekend's win over Burnley. Kevin Mirallas has been linked with a move away from Everton following an injury-hit term at the Toffees . Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits to not knowing what the future holds for his Belgian star . There were reports this week Tottenham would try to make the forward part of a swap deal with their winger Aaron Lennon, who is currently on loan at Goodison Park. However, Martinez backed Mirallas to put the continuing debate about his future to one side. 'The total honest truth is we don't know what is going to happen in the future,' he said. 'I heard somewhere that he had one year left and it was a bit of an unsettled situation but that is not the case, he has two years left. 'I don't think it has ever been an issue. Sometimes there has been too much said on the outside. 'With any footballer now it does not matter whether you have one year or six years left, what is more important is being happy, feeling ready to be part of the project and be an important player going forward.

'When you see him on the pitch he is someone who brings a real desire to score goals, he brings us a goalscoring threat which is quite special and all I want is for Kevin to enjoy his football and carry on performing well. 'He is someone who takes responsibility on the pitch, wants to make things happen and scoring the goal was an important moment. 'Kevin has always been a really hard-working player day-to-day and I have seen him progressing but I have never seen an issue in his performances at all. 'The way he performed on Saturday showed that. In every window you have to sit down and make sure everyone who is fully committed is ready to be part of the future.

Speaking to the New York Daily News, she described how after the blunder she broke down in tears and 'wanted to go in a wormhole and disappear.'

"Boris Berezovsky was killed in his bathroom because he was preparing to give Vladimir Putin evidence of a plot involving leading oligarchs to topple the strongman in a coup, it was claimed today. The exiled Russian tycoon was slain by Western secret services linked to the plan to overthrow the Kremlin leader. The theory comes from Berezovsky's former long-time head of security Sergei Sokolov, who disputed the version of British police that the ex-billionaire took his own life, aged 67, in Berkshire in March 2013. Scroll down for video . 'Convinced': Berezovsky's former head of security Sergei Sokolov says he knows his boss did not take his own life - and alleges he was killed by Western secret services over evidence of a plot to overthrow Putin . 'I am convinced it was done by the Western secret services,' he said. 'If Berezovsky's death is a puzzle for you, it is a problem solved for me. Boris was killed simply because he possessed certain secret information and was going to make it public. This is not just my guess, I know it for sure.' Sokolov, the head of a major Moscow private security agency, said his ex-boss was intent on returning to Russia, and had opened negotiations with Putin on allowing him back despite years of bitter opposition to the president. 'Boris forwarded Vladimir Putin a letter with repentance,' he said. Deceased: Boris Berezovsky, left, was found dead at his ex-wife's home in Berkshire in March 2013.

"Pregnant women who suffer extreme morning sickness are at greater risk of their children having language and speech delays, and attention disorders, warn researchers. A new study shows the condition suffered by the Duchess of Cambridge during both her pregnancies triples the risk of developmental problems compared with women who have normal nausea and vomiting. About 10,000 women a year in the UK are affected by the debilitating hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) - a severe form of morning sickness which causes constant vomiting, crippling weakness and dehydration. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum - the severe morning sickness suffered by Kate Middleton - are more likely to have children with language and speech delays, and attention disorders, a study claims . A new study from the University of California, Los Angeles, (UCLA) looks specifically at whether the condition affects brain development in childhood. Marlena Fejzo, an associate researcher in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said the link appeared to be due to lack of nutrition in early pregnancy – especially in the first five weeks – rather than medication. She said: ‘These findings show that it is vital to take HG seriously so these pregnant women can get nutritional support right away. ‘An encouraging finding is that we did not find any association with medications to treat this disorder and neurodevelopmental delays, so I speculate that the neurodevelopmental outcomes are more likely caused by nutrient deficiency early in pregnancy rather than medication.’ The research appears in the online edition of the European Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Reproductive Biology. The study looked at 312 children born to 203 mothers with HG between 2007 and 2011 and compared those to 169 children born to 89 mothers who did not have HG. More than 1,000 women with severe morning sickness have an abortion each year because their symptoms are so unbearable, research shows. Many are denied vital yet relatively cheap treatment by GPs who expect them to simply ‘get on with it’ or end their pregnancy. The condition Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) – which the Duchess of Cambridge has suffered during both her pregnancies – affects about one in 100 expectant mothers a year. It is far more severe than ordinary morning sickness and some women are left bedbound or need to be admitted to hospital due to extreme dehydration. Research by abortion provider BPAS and Pregnancy Sickness Support found many women were refused treatment because doctors deemed it too costly, unnecessary or potentially harmful. The disorders found included attention and sensory disorders and learning, speech and language delays. Dr Fejzo said the mechanism for exposure to HG and the resulting abnormal neurologic development is not clear. The women in the study experienced nausea and vomiting so severe that they lost at least five pounds and became so dehydrated they needed intravenous fluids. Children exposed in the womb to HG had a 3.28-fold increased risk of neurodevelopmental delays. Dr Fejzo said: ‘There is an urgent need to address whether aggressive treatment that includes vitamin and nutrient supplementation in women with early symptoms of

"Winston Reid has expressed his delight at signing a new contract with West Ham and said their imminent move to the Olympic Stadium was a big factor in his decision. The New Zealand defender put pen to paper on a six-and-a-half-year contract worth £60,000-a-week. And the 26-year-old, who had been linked with moves to Arsenal and Tottenham with his contract expiring in the summer, is pleased to have his future tied down. Winston Reid has agreed a new six-and-a-half-year contract with West Ham . Reid had been linked with a move at the end of the season to either Tottenham Hotspur or Arsenal . He told fanbookz.com: 'Obviously I'm absolutely delighted to have signed a new contract with West Ham. I've enjoyed my time here, and I just needed to make sure that the decision was a right one for me and my family. 'There were a lot of factors that I took into account when I was making my decision, but most importantly I felt that I was valued at the club - we will be improving in future seasons and I really feel at home here. 'With regards the decision that I've had to make, I had to be sure that it was going to be a place that I was going to be for the next few years of my life, so I have to feel at home and I feel welcome here. I enjoy living in London and my family is settled so that was the most important thing I had to think about.' Reid took his time in making a decision but clearly feels his future lies with the club having made 27 appearances across all competitions this season. He added: 'It might have been frustrating for the fans to have it drag out for so long, but whenever I've been asked this question over the past few months it's just been when we've been negotiating. 'You don't sort something out in the course of one day, there's always got to be some sort of give or take when doing these things. 'There was no big drama towards it, and there was a lot of stuff in the press that was misleading with regards to my situation, but the main thing is that now we've got it sorted. 'Both the club and I were keen to do something, and I'm happy to be staying here. Speaking to the chairman it was clear that the club is on the up, we've been getting better this year but we were realistic about the club and where it's at currently - there's a lot that we can still improve on, and that was the main thing.'

"Bans on texting and driving may be preventing deadly car accidents in the United States, says a new study. Researchers from Texas A&M School of Public Health found that hospitalizations from car crashes dropped 7 percent between 2003 and 20010 in the 45 states with texting bans when compared to states with no restrictions. The research report recently published in the American Journal of Public health could 'not prove' that a texting ban is what caused the critcal injury drop, though they said it was a likely cause. Most states: Most of the US has laws that ban drivers from texting while at the wheel to prevent accidents . Dangerous: Drivers between the ages of 25 and 40 are the most likely group of people to get in an accident related to texting and driving . Arizona, Texas, Montana, Missouri, and Oklahoma are the only five states in America that do not have texting at the wheel bans for all drivers. CBS reports that the study's leader Alva Ferdinand said that while it could not be proven that the lowered rate of hospitalization due to car accidents was caused by texting bans, the restrictions are still linked to a decline in crashes. Ferdinand said that the greatest benefit was seen in states where texting bans are strictly enforced and where an officer can stop a car just on suspicion the driver breaking the law. 'Some states have secondary enforcement,' Ferdinand explained. 'In those states, law enforcement has to catch you doing something else first -- like speeding or running a red light -- and then determine that you were texting.' The study also found that older drivers were more likely to make a texting and driving mistake than a younger driver. 'It's adults, too,' Ferdinand said. 'They're constantly checking emails and text messages.' Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA), said that adults between the ages of 25 and 40 were most likely to get in a texting and driving accident. Slow reaction time: Texting at the wheel is dangerous for drivers because it slows down their reaction times . The research group found that texting bans caused a 9 per cent drop in car-crash hospitalizations among Americans aged 22 and older. Even though young people benefited from the texting ban, the drop in hospitalizations was not numerically significant. There is a lack in data on texting and driving but Adkins believes that as more studies show more results in favour of the ban, more states will be likely to implement it. Adkins said that drivers should avoid texting while at the wheel at all costs even if they consider themselves to be good multitaskers. 'It should push those states with weaker laws to strengthen them,' Adkins told CBS. Research shows that texting at the wheel may be dangerous because it slows reactions more than drink or drugs. A study last year found sending a text message delays reaction times by 37 per cent. By comparison, using cannabis slows it by 21 per cent, and drinking to the

"(CNN)They may not be ""Star Trek""-type extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says. ""I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years,"" NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe. ""We know where to look. We know how to look,"" she said. ""In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road."" NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. ""Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice,"" the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms. ""We are not talking about little green men,"" Stofan said at the panel. ""We are talking about little microbes."" Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. ""I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star,"" he said. And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? ""Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low,"" he said. ""And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting.""

"Leroy J. Toppins went missing on Friday night while playing with siblings in the front yard of his family's home in Washington Court House, Ohio. His parents worriedly reported him missing after he disappeared about 6pm. More than 100 locals joined a search for the toddler that lasted all day Saturday.

Tragedy: Leroy J. Toppins went missing about 6pm Friday while playing with siblings in the front yard of his family's home in Washington Court House, Ohio. His body was found in an adjacent quarry Saturday night . Scene: After a search spanning almost 24 hours, dive crews found the toddler's body about 7pm Friday in Sugar Creek Stone Quarry, a short distance from the family's house . The property is adjacent to the former Sugar Creek Stone Quarry. The quarry had been abandoned for several years. Search crews had been combing through the area for almost 24 hours, but were hampered by the area's conditions, according to Concord Green Fire Chief Ralph Stegbauer. 'Even the creek lines where the volunteers are working are very steep,' Stegabauer told WHIO. 'A lot of brush, a lot of trees and, of course, this time of year the water is up high so we have a lot of things in the water.' The boy's body was found about three feet from the pond's shore. Tragically, officials said the pond wouldn't have been there if it weren't for recent rain. No foul play: Police say they have no reason to consider the death of Leroy suspicious, believing he wandered off by himself . Police said the missing two-year-old was found dead in a runoff pond near his house in Fayette County. The quarry was adjacent to his family's home and had been abandoned for years . Police do not believe the death was suspicious. 'At this point there's nothing to indicate foul play,' Fayette County Sheriff Vernon Stanforth told WLWT5. 'The family has been extremely throughout the process. 'We believe the child merely just wandered away and got too close to the water. 'We're never equipped to deal with death regardless of where it is, it's especially troubling when you have a small baby.' Washington Court House is a city of about 14,000, located between Cincinnati and Columbus.

"A Waitrose magazine showcasing the food of Israel has been hammered online for ignoring what activists regard to be the 'illegal occupation of Palestine'. The supermarket chain's monthly food magazine 'Waitrose Kitchen' contained a 32-page brochure called Taste of Israel. But the glossy advert, sponsored by Israel's Government Tourist Board, has sparked outrage among campaigners - with some claiming it ignores what they believe is an 'apartheid regime'. Scroll down for video . A 32-page brochure called Taste of Israel (pictured) within Waitrose Kitchen Magazine has been hammered on the internet . The Waitrose magazine features a glossy pull-out featuring recipe ideas and an 'A-Z food glossary' of Israeli ingredients and dishes . Others have posted harrowing images taken during last year's Gaza conflict. The travel and food pull-out, in the February edition, contains an 'A-Z food glossary' of Israeli ingredients and dishes as well as a guide of its 'Top 10 restaurants'. It also includes 'market tours' interviews with top Israeli chefs and an article explaining 'Why Israeli wine is winning awards, plus five wines to taste.' Recipes in the insert include shakshuka, white fish on vegetable ragu, endive salad, and 'instructions for creating the perfect falafel and hummus'. Backlash: The advert sparked anger online with some saying it ignored what campaigners described as an 'apartheid' Outrage: Some threatened to boycott the supermarket chain after learning of the contents of the magazine . Anger: One Twitter user accused Waitrose and the Israel Tourist Office of 'pushing Israeli propaganda' Criticism: Others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation . The Palestine Solidarity Campaign called the insert 'disgraceful' adding: 'The booklet is a prime example of Israeli government propaganda, highlighting its efforts to distract the public abroad from its brutal military occupation of Palestinian land by replacing the image of an apartheid regime with that of a tourist-friendly, culture-loving country.' Activisits took to Twitter with some vowing to boycott Waitrose - and encouraging others to follow suit. One user, Rory Evans, wrote: Nothing like the taste of falafel with a side-order of apartheid, is there @waitrose #tasteofisrael.' Another Twitter user, 'Paul in Brighton' said: 'Waitrose and Israel Tourist Office are pushing Israeli propaganda 'Taste of Israel' using @waitrose #tasteofIsrael.' One said that the magazine 'erases Palestinian history and culture' while others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation. However, some hit back at criticism of Waitrose, with one urging activists to 'leave war and politics out of cooking.'

"Ivan Balashov took this selfie on one phone before stealing one he preferred - only to be caught when police identified him from the picture . A phone thief took a selfie with a handset before stealing a model he preferred - only to be caught when police identified him from the photo. Ivan Balashov was browsing through smartphones in a shop in Novokuznetsk, southern Russia when he took a picture of himself wearing a bobble hat and a fake Reebok top. But after deciding the camera on the mobile was not good enough, the 22-year-old grabbed another handset and headed for the exit where he was stopped by shop security. A shop spokesman said: 'When he was asked where he was going he told the security guard that he wanted to buy the phone - and was going to his car to get his wallet. 'For some reason the guard let him go outside the shop with the phone at which point the man ran off.' But when police arrived they quickly discovered Balashov’s selfie. A police spokesman said: 'The man is well-known to the police so when the shop assistant told officers he had been taking photos with another phone they immediately recognised him and were able to go straight to the man’s house. 'When they arrived he denied being anywhere near the shop so in a way condemned himself as we were able to prove he had been there just 30 minutes earlier.' On his way home he had sold the stolen phone in a pawn shop for the equivalent of £120. Appearing in court, Balashov was found guilty and given a three month suspended sentence. Police found Balashov's selfie on a phone in the store and immiediately recognised him. He was found guilty and given a three month suspended sentence (file picture)

"Andrew Hennells, pictured, posted a message on Facebook admitting his plans to rob a Tesco supermarket 15 minutes before holding up staff . An armed raider threatened staff at a Tesco supermarket with a knife less than fifteen minutes after he boasted on Facebook that he was going to rob the store. Andrew Hennells, 31, of Gaywood, King's Lynn posted the message 'Doing. Tesco. Over' at 7.25pm on Friday, February 13. Withing a quarter of an hour, Norfolk Police received an emergency call that a man brandishing a knife was demanding cash from staff at the supermarket. Hennells fled the scene before police arrived but he was arrested by armed police in a nearby pub with £410 in stolen cash. Norfolk Crown court heard that officers also recovered a knife. Hennells, who appeared in court by video link from Norfolk Prison admitted one count of robbery and one count of carrying a knife as an offensive weapon. Judge Katherine Moore adjourned the case until April 8 as she requested full pre-sentence and medical reports on Hennells. The judge said: 'I want all the up-to-date information as to his mental state.' Judge Moore remanded Hennells in custody and warned him that all sentencing options would be open. 'These are serious matters,' she said. Commenting after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Pete Jessop, of King's Lynn CID, said a member of the public had tipped them off about the robbery. He said: 'We have not got to the bottom of why he posted the pictures and words on Facebook, or why he did the job in the first place. 'It was bizarre and an unusual set of circumstances. 'While the message and pictures on Facebook did not solve the case, it did confirm what we already knew. 'But the thing that made it easier and quicker for us to solve the case was the assistance from the public. 'However, the quickness does not take away from its seriousness or how traumatic it was for the victims of the robbery.' Hennells also posted on Facebook hours before carrying out the robbery that he had 'shared' a Bare Knuckles Gypsies' 'The hardest man in Ireland' video. Hennells posted this message only 15 minutes before threatening staff at Tesco's in King's Lynn . Earlier in the afternoon of the raid, Hennells posted a photograph of a large knife on his Facebook page .

"A heartbroken mother has spoken out about her relentless grief after her baby son was brutally murdered in a random attack when a stranger broke into their home. Casey Veal's son Zayden was just 10 months old when he was bludgeoned to death by a drug-crazed burglar who broke into their Bendigo home at random, whilst the baby slept in his cot in June 2012. 'It tortures because it's something that's always like – why me? Why our house? Why our Zayden?' a heartbroken Ms Veal told 60 Minutes.

'My son was murdered so he could get a hit of ice. That's it,' Ms Veal told 60 Minutes. Hicks left the home with nothing more than a wallet and a pair of sunglasses. He unplugged the baby monitor before unleashing the vicious attack on the defenceless baby while Ms Veal and Zayden's brother Xavier, then aged three, slept. When Ms Veal woke she realised they'd been robbed. She was then faced with the horror of discovering the brutal attack on her son, leaving him almost beyond recognition. 'When I walked over to the cot, I pulled the blankets back and that's when I saw his face and there was blood everywhere underneath him,' she said tearfully. Zayden had been repeatedly bashed before he was stabbed 32 times with a homemade copper baton. The happy baby with a beautiful smile suffered a crushed skull, broken collar bone and a broken rib.

"Mechanic Clive Howard carried out a string of rapes and attempted kidnaps on lone women in Norwich, Suffolk and Cambridge over a 28 year period . A mechanic who lived a calm, quiet life with his elderly parents was all the time living a secret double life as a sex attacker. Clive Howard, 56, of Suffolk, has admitted carrying out a string of rapes and kidnaps of women during a 28 year period. The serial rapist confessed to the crimes after he was caught after raping a woman at a car park in Norwich when his number plate was recorded on CCTV. But police fear he may have carried out even more attacks across three different counties and have appealed for any victims to come forward. Detective Sergeant Chris Burgess, of Norfolk Police rape investigation unit said: 'Cases like this don't come up very often - we're talking about a serial rapist. 'We want to give people the chance to come forward.' Howard, who lived a double life with his parents, had initially denied the rape in Norwich but changed his plea on the day of his trial. At a hearing at Norwich Crown Court he admitted seven counts of rape, three charges of attempted kidnap and one count of attempted rape, between 1986 and 2014. Howard, of Battisford, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, was caught by police after he attacked a woman in St Helens Wharf car park, Norwich, on May 30 2014. The victim, in her 20s, was walking home after a night out when she was given a lift by Howard, who then raped her. She tried to take a picture of the car's registration number but Howard grabbed her phone and hurled it into a bush before he sped off. The woman found it before dialling 999. Police were able to get part of the car's number plate from CCTV - and that led them straight to Howard, the registered owner. He was arrested and charged a few days later. Det Sgt Burgess said Howard had done 'two to three loops' around the city 'before he managed to pick his victim'. After he was charged Howard's DNA was put into the national police database which raised an unsolved case in Cambridgeshire in 2013. Howard was caught after part of his Volvo number plate was captured on CCTV after he raped a woman . Howard's number plate was recorded after he parked at St Helens Wharf in Norwich and raped the woman . Detectives found 'striking similarities' to the Norwich assault. Howard's DNA matched a profile obtained during an investigation into the attempted kidnap of a woman in her 20s on May 5, 2013 in Cambridge park Christ's Pieces. The woman managed to fend off Howard, scratching him in the process, and DNA was later retrieved from underneath her fingernail. He was linked to three other attempted kidnappings in Cambridge, one of which happened just 30 minutes before he struck in Christ's Pieces. Howard also tried to abduct two women in the city on February 15, 2014, during the night. Det

"Sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others, a recent study claimed . The implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding, it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders. This is because the genes that make up the people who we are, and the environments in which we are raised cannot be considered independently of each other. The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, a study found. Johnny Savile (left) is accused of abusing seven women, while Jimmy Savile (right) raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse . The research analysed DNA from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. It found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population. In seeking to explain this connection, the researchers found that in only 2 per cent of cases could this familial connection be explained by shared environmental factors. This can include social or environmental aspects of their upbringing that siblings would have experienced together. On the other hand, their shared genetics were a factor in 40 per cent of cases, with the remaining 58 per cent of cases stemming from environmental factors not shared between family members. Genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child molestation (46 per cent) than for adult rape (19 per cent). While the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending, it cannot of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved. Dr Mairi Levitt says that genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment . Putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents. Of course genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment. As can be seen from the percentages above, the largest proportion of cases involved a large, rag bag of environmental factors that are by far the greatest influence on behaviour. You may not have been born a criminal, but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour. This is according to a recent study which found that experiences, such as divorce and sexual abuse, could affect gene expressions that control a person's predisposition to delinquency. The study used a survey of 1,337 students aged 17 or 18 in Västmanland, Sweden, who anonymously completed questionnaires reporting on their behaviour. As well as their behaviour, they spoke about past family conflict, experiences of sexual abuse, and the quality of their relationship with their parents. They also provided a sample of

"A troubled socialite who pleaded guilty to dealing drugs from her Range Rover in wealthy suburbs says there wasn't ‘anything difficult about it’ as she hit back at reports she may face up to 10 years behind bars. Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs. The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story recounting her double life as a drug dealer. Scroll down for video . Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs . 'I want to make one point very clear: 1000 pills + 94g of cocaine + $33,000 does not = 10 year gaol,' she wrote on Facebook. 'On averages, what I'm looking at is a 4 year head sentence with probably 2 years parole and 2 years gaol time... minus my 8 months served.' A Current Affair re-enacted the 'sophisticated drug ring' Stockbridge had set up and confronted her on the street for a segment that aired on Wednesday night ahead of her sentencing next month. The program recreated a series of drug deals one day in November 2013 where she collected $5,750 between 4.40pm and 7.30pm from nine deliveries across Sydney. 'The money they're quoting that I made on the night re-enacted is gross of course, not profit,' Stockbridge wrote. 'I'm not sure how anyone could run a sophisticated drug ring from the front seat of their car? And besides, there really isn't anything difficult about it whatsoever.' The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story about her drug dealing . Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society . Stockbridge was arrested at her Darlinghurst home in December 2013 and police found more than 380g of a substance containing MDMA, under 95g of a substance that contained cocaine, a cutting tool for cocaine, resealable bags, 10 mobile phones and $33,620 in cash. Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers she had saved in her phone and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society. The court was also told she sent messages to customers with special deals, including 'buy two grams and get the third half price'. Police started recording evidence of the transactions by bugging her car in September 2013 - a fact Stockbridge says she knew and was careful about.

'On averages, what I'm looking at is a 4 year head sentence with probably 2 years parole and 2 years gaol time... minus my 8 months served.'

"Kevin Pietersen has yet to consider Leicestershire's bold attempt to sign him for this summer's NatWest T20 Blast. After new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted last weekend there is still a possibility of a return to international cricket for the record-breaking batsman, sacked last year, the first definite attempt by a county to secure his services surfaced on Friday. Leicestershire chief executive Wasim Khan told Cricinfo he had been in touch with Pietersen's advisers about the possibility of signing the 34-year-old between his existing commitments at the Indian and Caribbean premier leagues. Kevin Pietersen played for Surrey in last year's Natwest Twenty20 Blast . Pietersen's agent confirmed an initial discussion did take place, but added it was 'some time ago'. Leicestershire's gambit therefore appears to pre-date Graves' remarks, in which he indicated Pietersen's return to county cricket - as a pre-requisite of being considered again for England - would need to encompass all formats, rather than just Twenty20. Wasim told Cricinfo: 'I approached his agent about his T20 availability. 'But he said it was unlikely he would play any T20 (in England) due to his full CPL commitments.' The former England batsman pictured watching QPR's 2-1 defeat by Arsenal on Wednesday night . Pietersen's agent said: 'I haven't had a conversation with Kevin about Leicestershire - it is not something we have discussed.' Pietersen, who was axed by the ECB 13 months ago after England's 2013/14 Ashes whitewash defeat and described by his employers' managing director Paul Downton as 'disengaged', has since published an autobiography in which he is very critical of several former team-mates and management staff. He played for Surrey in last year's domestic T20 competition, but was de-registered by them at the end of the season. Pietersen, playing for Melbourne Stars, waits to bat in the Big Bash League semi-final in January .

"This morning observers across Europe were treated to a rare solar eclipse as the moon passed across the face of the sun and obscured it almost entirely from view. But while many, in the UK especially, had to contend with clouds, plenty of images captured the event – and an odd black spot on the sun. While it might have looked like a speck of dust at first, this was actually a sunspot on the solar surface, caused by a concentration of magnetic fields. Scroll down for video . People in the UK were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning. But several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun (shown). These were sunspots, caused by concentrations of magnetic fields. They are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares . Sunspots are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings. They range hugely in size, from just 10 miles (16km) to 100,000 miles (160,000km) - big enough to be seen from Earth without a telescope, and more than ten times the size of our planet. Sunspots are regions where powerful magnetic fields emanate from the sun . These magnetic fields can get wound up so tightly that they rise up from inside the Sun, and the sunspots mark the points where this happens. They are much colder than the rest of the sun's surface and usually last a few days before disappearing. They have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200°C (4,890 to 7,590°F), compared to 5,500°C (9,930°F) for the surrounding solar material, which is why they are so visible. Sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun, namely solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), all of which are linked to magnetic fields. The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. Sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes, regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface. Sunspots (previous Nasa image shown) are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings . Some observers took to Twitter to express their views on the sunspots, which were spotted in live footage showing the moon passing across the face of the sun . Others bemoaned the cloud coverage in the UK, which meant that many observers were unable to actually see the event at all. There were more than 10,000 mentions of the eclipse per minute on Twitter, according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch . The sun goes through a periodic change

"'Ladies' man' Naushad Faruk but has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for voyeurism and perverting the course of justice . A PR cameraman who lured glamour models into making secret 'sex tapes' by pretending he worked for a lads' mag has been jailed for three-and-half years. Naushad Faruk, also known as Jonny Na$h, sent a revenge porn-style clip to one of the women after convincing her to strip for a fake spread in men's magazine Loaded. The 33-year-old, who featured in BBC Three reality show Boom Town as a self-styled 'ladies' man,' taped women performing sex acts on him with a secret camera hidden in his watch. On his Twitter page, poser Faruk has posted pictures of himself attending the film premieres of Sylvester Stallone action flick 'The Expendables 3' and 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit', starring Chris Pine. After his first court appearance, Faruk tweeted two of the victims' real names and working names and linked them to a national newspaper article, thus breaching their legal right to anonymity. He also called the workplace of a prostitute he secretly filmed and pretended to be a national newspaper reporter, making numerous threats including exposing the case in the media and creating a 'media storm.' During his trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, Faruk, of Goldfinch Crescent, Bracknell, Berkshire, was removed from court seven times for being disruptive and heckling the main victim and other witnesses. Faruk, who described himself as 'the master of seduction' on his BBC Three show, was convicted of three counts of voyeurism and two charges of perverting the course of justice. As well as being jailed, he was slapped with a 12-year restraining order preventing him from going near the victims. During his trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, Faruk was removed from the courtroom seven times for being disruptive and heckling the main victim and other witnesses . Detective Constable Rob Jones said: 'This case shows that if someone threatens to release 'revenge porn' into the public domain they will be dealt with robustly, not only by the police but also by the courts, as is demonstrated by this sentence. 'The women involved have been extremely traumatised and felt extreme fear throughout, especially the sex worker who was ""petrified"" when Faruk called her place of work. 'Because of this she wanted to withdraw from the trial but I was able to reassure her that we would look after her, as we do with all vulnerable victims and witnesses.' After secretly filming the Camden-based glamour model engaging in sexual activity with him, Faruk sent her a message on social media in March 2014 with the video edited to music showing her professional name on the screen. The message ended with 'TBC' and a threat saying: 'What happens next is up to you.' The woman reported the message to police and, after an investigation, arrested Faruk. When detectives scoured Faruk's digital media they found other 'sex tapes' and were able to identify two other women, a model and a sex worker. Both videos were secretly filmed using a camera watch, one at

"The inquiry into the Iraq war, lead by Sir John Chilcot, began in 2009, stopped taking evidence in 2011, but will not report until 2016, a source said . The findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the Iraq war are unlikely to be unveiled this year. Further delays to Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry into the war were reported by BBC’s Newsnight and will fuel claims those criticised over the war are trying to bury bad news. It was initially thought it would be delayed until after the general election amid claims it could be damning for Labour. But it has now been suggested the findings of the inquiry, which began in 2009, will not be published until 2016. Newsnight’s Diplomatic Editor, Mark Urban said he had been told the inquiry will be delayed until at least 2016. Tony Blair is expected to be come under intense scrutiny for sanctioning the ill-fated invasion. The former PM has denied that he was trying to obstruct the inquiry. Earlier this year, he apeared rattled when journalists put to him David Cameron’s claim, that Labour had got the publication delayed. He pointed to a statement released by his office which said: ‘It is not true to say that Tony Blair has caused the delay in the report’s publication’. Mr Blair is one of dozens who is believed to be criticised. Every one fingered has the right to respond to the dossier of evidence against them, often running to hundreds of pages. The inquiry - which stopped taking evidence in 2011 - was also set back by the death of one of its members and staff losses. The publication of the report was expected to be delayed until after the election as it is thought to be highly critical of senior political figures, including Tony Blair, but will likely not report until even later .

"A woman found her fiancé on a Facebook selling page after he jokingly offered himself up for sale. Beckie Bennett, 43, was browsing her local buy and sell Facebook group when an unusual offer caught her eye - a local man had advertised himself as 'house trained' and up for sale. Richard Yardley, 38, had written the post as a joke. But when Beckie commented to check out the goods on offer, he asked her on a date. Beckie Bennett and Richard Yardley met after Richard jokingly advertised himself on a buy and sell Facebook page and Beckie commented on his picture. The pair are now engaged . Following their unusual introduction, the couple are now engaged after Richard proposed, and mother-of-three Beckie says she has bagged herself the best bargain ever - the man of her dreams. She said: 'We're going to tie the knot next August, and it's all thanks to that Facebook page. Richard is the best thing I've ever won on the buy, sell and swap page.' In May 2013, Beckie, of Harbury, near Leamington Spa, logged on to Facebook to search for furniture for her son's new flat. Cheeky blonde Richard had jokingly posted a picture of himself on to the page with the caption: 'man for sale - free to a good home.' Beckie said: 'I saw the picture of Richard with his glasses on and I decided to play along. 'I commented to check out Richard's credentials. It's the first rule of Facebook shopping - make sure what you're buying is up to scratch. ''Do you clean, wash and drive?' I asked. Within seconds he'd replied, 'all of the above.''

"Nicola Sturgeon (pictured) said SNP is open to an arrangement with Labour and suggested Labour's backbenchers would support some SNP policies . Ed Miliband will be 'held hostage' in Downing Street by the SNP, it was claimed today as Nicola Sturgeon said there was no way Labour could win without her. A dramatic collapse in support for Labour in Scotland is expected to rob Mr Miliband of an overall majority, forcing him to rely on the SNP to form a government. Ms Sturgeon teased the Labour leader today, claiming he is still 'clinging to the pretence' that he has a chance of winning a majority on May 7, insisting she will wield 'clout' in Westminster. Ms Sturgeon said her party was open to an arrangement with Labour after the election. The Scottish First Minister hinted that many of Labour's MPs would support certain SNP policies such as bringing an end to austerity and scrapping Trident. After weeks of pressure, Mr Miliband has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP but he could be forced to do a deal to stop them voting down his government. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'He is still clinging to the pretence he has got some chance of winning an overall majority. 'We have got vast experience as a minority Government ... the principles are the same. You have to build alliances, you have to win votes on a case-by-case basis. 'It would be far better than what usually happens to Scotland at Westminster, which is we are ignored or sidelined. 'The bottom line here is, if Scotland wants to have that influence, that power, that clout in Westminster, the only way get it is to vote SNP. 'If there is real SNP strength in the House of Commons we can force progressive change.' She also repeated the threat from former First Minister Alex Salmond to lock the Tories out of government, even if David Cameron wins the most seats. Brushing aside claims it was arrogant, Ms Sturgeon replied: 'If the Tories can't command a majority, then they don't deserve to be in government.' Labour leader Ed Miliband used the launch of his election campaign at the Olympic Park in east London today to claim: 'There is one way to get the Tories out and that's to elect a Labour government' Senior Conservative William Hague condemned the remarks as proof that Mr Miliband would be propeped up by a party which wanted to break up the Union. He said: 'Now you have it straight from Nicola Sturgeon – it is the SNP's sworn intention to hold Ed Miliband hostage in Downing Street and dictate terms on how Britain is governed. 'And we know too what's in the ransom note: £148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay. Labour campaign chief Douglas Alexander (pictured) said Ms sturgeon has an 'anyone but Labour' strategy and is committed to independence . 'We cannot let this happen to our country. The only

The 41-year-old was discovered by three people passing by the small alleyway near Amos Street in Westmead shortly after 9.30pm, where she was on the phone when the random attack happened. In a cruel twist, the mother of one was speaking to her husband when she cried out: 'I think I’ve been stabbed' as he listened helplessly over the phone while his wife was brutally attacked just metres from her home,' The Daily Telegraph reports.

Nearby resident Arvand Amirian told 9News he had found Ms Arun with blood all over her body after hearing 'crying screams' that 'didn't sound normal'. 'There was blood covering her face, her neck, her chest - her chest wasn't even moving so that's when I assumed she was gone,' Amirian said.

"A millionaire has won a legal victory which could see a £10.5 million solar farm removed at a cost of £1.5 million - because it overshadows his Grade II listed home. Daniel Gerber from Broughton Gifford, Wiltshire, was horrified when developers started constructing the 54-acre site on the doorstep of his six-bedroom Grade-II listed home - which is worth almost £3million. He claims he was not informed of the planning application by the local authority - despite the development being just 45 metres from the boundary of his property. Gifford Hall (pictured) Mr Gerber's Grade-II listed home has six bedrooms and is worth almost £3million . Norrington Solar Farm, based near Mr Gerber's home, was opened in June last year at a lost of £10.5 million . Mr Gerber only became aware of the project when he went out for a walk in March last year and found construction was already underway. He took his case to the High Court where he argued that English Heritage should also have been consulted as a listed property was involved. One of the country's top judges, Mr Justice Dove, upheld his claim and has ordered Wiltshire Council to reconsider the planning application for the site. Daniel Gerber (pictured) was 'horrified' when developers started constructing the 54-acre solar farm on the doorstep of his Grade-II listed home . If it is refused the solar farm - which became operational in June last year - may have to be ripped up and the council could be sued by the developers. Mr Gerber, who has lived in Broughton Gifford for five years, has now spoken of his victory for the first time. The father-of-three said he was compelled to act and save the beautiful countryside around his home for future generations. 'This case is about Wiltshire Council not following a prescribed, legal planning process but it is also about what it means to live in the countryside and what we leave for the next generation,' he said. 'You can imagine my shock and horror in March 2014 when I left my house with my two year old to take a walk through our garden into the open countryside. 'I could not believe the scale of the development that had started and immediately rushed back inside to phone Wiltshire Council. 'The decision to place a 22.1 hectare solar farm on productive farmland, next to a Conservation Area and in beautiful, open countryside was made by one person - the planning officer. 'A decision to build a massive, industrial development in the countryside should have gone to the Planning Committee. 'With help one family was able to challenge a multi-billion pound U.S. company and a local council with a £350 million overall budget.

"A man rushed to hospital for a kidney transplant has spoken of the dilemma he faced after learning the donor organ could be infected with HIV. Tony Gartside had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney and pancreas had become available. The transplant window was so small that after putting the phone down at 3am, he was rushed from his home in Plymouth to Oxford for the operation. But upon arriving, he was told that the organs had come from the victim of a drugs overdose - and it would be two weeks before tests revealed if they were HIV free. Tony Gartside, 40, had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney had become available. But he faced a dilemma after learning the donor organ could be infected with HIV . Mr Gartside, 40, was born with type 1 diabetes, and his kidneys began to fail by the time he was 32. He said: 'They showed me into a room and told me the donor organs had come from a death by drug overdose and asked if I still wanted to go ahead. 'Because the person died by drug overdose, they wouldn't know whether the donor had HIV for two weeks. 'It was a scary process having to say yes or no after sitting in the back of an ambulance for hours. 'I thought: ""Do I risk it and say yes, or do I say no and wait another 18 months, or even longer?"" 'In the end, I went ahead with it.' The kidney transplant surgery took 10 hours and left Mr Gartside with 32 staples in his stomach. After the surgery, he was sick for days, unable to even stand up straight, and was concerned about the risk of HIV. Two weeks later the HIV results came back - and were, to his relief, negative. He has since made a full recovery. Mr Gartside said: 'My diabetes has completely changed - it's amazing - and even that doesn't describe how good I feel. 'It's a second chance and I will be forever grateful to the donor's parents for making that decision.' Two weeks after the kidney transplant, the HIV results came back - and were negative . He has now set up a support group for transplant patients - the Mayflower Support Group - which supports patients going through the transplant procedure. He explained: 'Doctors have the clinical experience and can tell you what's going to happen during surgery, but they don't have a realistic explanation of what is going to happen for the patient. 'It's good to have someone to talk to who has been through what they're about to go through. 'The transplant has made me feel like I really want to give something back.' Last year, two patients in Wales died after being given kidney transplants infected with a parasitic worm. Darren Hughes, 42, and Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were each given a kidney from a transplant donor

"Excrement thrown at the statue of British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes has triggered a wave of protests across South Africa against 'racist' historical figures. Memorials to South Africa's colonial past were defaced by mainly young black protesters as statues of British monarchs Queen Victoria and King George V were splashed with paint in the cities of Port Elizabeth and Durban respectively. Vandals poured paint over Scottish-South African missionary Andrew Murray's statue in the Western Cape. War memorials were also defaced. A bronze rider marking the Anglo-Boer War from 1899 to 1902, was toppled from his horse. Object of anger: This statue of Queen Victoria outside the Port Elizabeth city library in South Africa is among a number of memorials to British colonials that have been vandalised during protests against 'racist' figures . A statue of a British soldier lays on the ground after being broken off its base in Port Elizabeth, South Africa . The defaced statue of British mining magnate and politician, Cecil John Rhodes, is lifted by a crane, from its position at the University of Cape Town (left), while (right) a chair marks the spot on the plinth where the decades old bronze statue stood before it was vandalised . In the latest demonstration, vandals smeared paint the figure of a young Mohandas Gandhi. Standing in the square in downtown Johannesburg named for Mahatma Gandhi, the memorial marks the Indian anti-colonial leader's time in South Africa, where he formulated the principle of passive resistance. The protester, who smudged white paint on Gandhi's cloak, accused him of being racist during his time in the country. Founding fathers of Afrikaner nationalism were also targeted. In Pretoria, the memorial of 19th century Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger was twice daubed with bright green paint, while the statue of Marthinus Pretorius, who founded the capital city, was splashed with reddish brown paint, according to local media reports. The statue of Louis Botha, the president of the South African Union in the early 1900s, was smeared with red and blue paint outside parliament in Cape Town on the same day that the Rhodes sculpture was removed from its perch overlooking the University of Cape Town after weeks of student protest. In the Free State province, a statue of Boer General Jan Fick was splashed with red paint in the town named after him in 1883, Ficksburg. Another statue is cleaned down after being splashed with green paint on Pretoria's Church Square . Security guards (left) walk past a statue of former South African statesman and Afrikaner leader Louis Botha, which has been defaced with red paint outside the South African parliament building in Cape Town . Several people have been arrested and local authorities have spent thousands of dollars cleaning up the statues.

It comes days after white solidarity groups held protests over the removal of a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes from the University of Cape Town after it

"Robert Durst's enigmatic second wife is the 'mastermind' who controls the couple's real estate fortune, according to anonymous sources. Debra Charatan, 58, married the 71-year-old in 2000 and sources have claimed she 'knew things were going to blow up before he was arrested' last weekend. Charatan, a powerful real estate agent in Manhattan, is also understood to manage Durst's estimated $65 million fortune. Real estate millionaire Durst was arrested last Saturday in New Orleans for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. Scroll down for video . Married: Debra Charatan (left) married Robert Durst (right) in 2000 and a source has described their relationship as 'extremely businesslike' Durst has been charged with murder in a Los Angeles killing 15 years ago, and has been suspected — but never charged — in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. In 2003, he was acquitted of murder in a dismemberment death in Texas. His arrest came shortly before the finale of the HBO series 'The Jinx' which detailed his links to the three killings. The source told the New York Post that Charatan had allegedly arranged to fly Durst to Cuba ahead of his arrest and said: 'She knew stuff was coming down. 'She's very, very smart. Any time he's in trouble, she's leaving and going to these places. 'She's extremely cunning. People call her a shark.' Last night, Durst was moved to the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, a jail equipped to deal with the mentally ill, an Orleans Parish Sheriff's spokesman said. In one episode of 'The Jinx', one interviewee said: 'A lot of people believe Debbie knows Bob's secrets, whatever they may be.' The source went on to describe Charatan and Durst's relationship as 'very businesslike' and said: 'He asks her opinion on things, and she tells him the truth.' They added: 'While the documentary was ongoing, she was acting like everything was fine. Only now is she's realizing that a volcano is about to erupt and it will be a real s**t show,' Arrested: Durst is pictured being transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on Tuesday . Sources have also claimed that Charatan 'knew a lot of stuff' about Durst when she married him in 2000. The pair had been close friends for years before that - even before Durst's first wife, Kathie, vanished in 1982. It is believed they first met in dated in 1988 and briefly lived together in 1990 before separating. The couple were married in December 2000 — a month after Durst discovered that authorities were reopening their probe into his first wife's disappearance. As his wife, Charatan gained spousal privilege, which meant she would not have to testify against him. Moved: Last night, Durst was moved to the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, a jail equipped to deal with the mentally ill, an Orleans Parish Sheriff's spokesman said. Durst was charged on Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Susan Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. He could

"A Texas mom who has already spent seven years in prison for the murder of her four-year-old adopted son, and was released shortly before Christmas, will not face new murder charges. Hannah Overton, 37, wiped back tears as she, along with her husband Larry and five children, celebrated news that after having her conviction overturned for poisoning her son, Andrew Burd, with an overdose of salt, prosecutors have dropped all charges against her and will no longer be looking into her case. Throughout her incarceration, her family stood by her and protested her innocence, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka had said shortly after she was released that he would push again for capital murder charges. He could do this as her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, meaning this would not be a case of double jeopardy. Scroll down for video . Hannah Overton (above wiping away tears with her daughter and son) will not be tried on murder charges again in the death of her adopted son . Overton's five children and husband Larry (above) were there to celebrate the news . In a news release however, Skura said that he would not be trying the case again due to 'a myriad of factors which came about after a careful review of the previous trial, re-interviewing some of the key witnesses, consulting with some of the medical experts involved in the case, reviewing evidence adduced at recent hearings and staffing the case with the current prosecutors assigned to the case.' A judge then granted Skura's motion to dismiss. 'Wow, we don't even know where to begin,' Overton said after hearing this news. 'We are so excited about all God has done in and through all of this. He has carried us through.' An appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News. Original prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since. On a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well. When he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning. A week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning. But during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt. The mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared

Here, gamer in Burma concentrates hard on a game of World of Warcraft . Instead of fitting a miniature fan like some of its rivals, ThermalTake, which produces cooling kit for computers, has designed a mouse with a matte coating or rough texture and rubber grips down its side (pictured) Instead of fitting a miniature fan like some of its rivals, Taiwan-based ThermalTake, which produces cooling kit for computers, has designed a mouse with a matte coating or rough texture and rubber grips down its side. ‘The new VENTUS X was designed with a new coating that gives full comfort while in gameplay,’ it says. This means that the tool retains its grip in the sweatiest situations, while ventilation is provided by a honeycomb grill where the hand rests on the mouse. The grille’s meant to help because sweat can evaporate faster than on a solid surface, when a user raises their hand or withdraws it, letting air to the area. Like many mice designed for serious gamers, it has a laser sensor so that sensitivity can be turned up high and programmable buttons. It costs $50 (£34) via gaming hardware websites. The grips mean that the tool doesn't get slippery in the sweatiest situations, while ventilation is provided by a honeycomb grill (pictured) where the hand rests on the mouse .

"More than 25 women have been airlifted from Royal Navy ships because of pregnancy. One ship - HMS Ocean – even had five pregnant sailors removed in emergency 'medevacs' during the last nine years, a Freedom of Information request revealed. And at least one woman was airlifted from HMS Illustrious, which was nicknamed 'HMS Lusty' by the crew before it was decommissioned last year. More than 25 women have been airlifted from Royal Navy ships because of pregnancy, including at least one woman from HMS Illustrious (above), which was nicknamed 'HMS Lusty' by the crew before it was decommissioned last year . Eighteen other ships - including HMS Dragon, HMS Enterprise and HMS Richmond - had emergency evacuations, data obtained by The Sun showed. A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed there was a strict 'no touching' rule in place at sea, which suggests the women conceived before boarding the ships or during leave. The data comes nine months after commander Sarah West, the first woman to captain a Royal Navy warship, was flown back to the UK following claims she had a sexual relationship with a member of her crew. An unnamed captain was appointed in her place and a military investigation was launched into the 42-year-old's conduct. A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed there was a strict 'no touching' rule in place at sea, which suggests the women conceived before boarding the ships or during leave (stock image above) Navy sources said Ms West left HMS Portland for ‘personal reasons’. The Ministry of Defence would not confirm what these reasons were or what action she would face. Women have been serving on Royal Navy ships since 1990 and in 2014 around 9 per cent of personnel were female. Last May three women made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy. Nearly 100 female British soldiers were sent home from Afghanistan after finding out they were pregnant. Ninety-nine servicewomen on operations were flown back to the UK between January 2006 and December 2013, a Freedom of Information request revealed. Sixteen women were removed from Afghanistan in 2013 due to pregnancy while 18 were sent home in 2011, the data showed. A further 102 women were evacuated from Iraq. Strict military rules ban mothers-to-be from serving in war zones. The women were flown back on flights usually reserved for injured troops and the true figure could be higher if others travelled via routine flights. Troops are reminded by senior officers to check they are not pregnant before they fly to the front line - but are not made to do pregnancy tests. Most of the babies would have been conceived before the mother left the UK but a small number of women may have become pregnant on tour. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said at the time: 'The small numbers of personnel who discover that they are pregnant on operations are returned at the first convenient opportunity.'

Police say Constant, who is black, wore a lifelike mask during the heist that made him look like an elderly white man. Master of disguise: Benoit Constant (left), 28, was arrested on robbery charges after police say he held up a North Carolina bank while wearing a lifelike mask of an elderly white man (right) Lifelike: Constant's disguise was recovered from a van that was found in Maryland a week after the robbery . Target: Constant is suspected of robbing the Carolinas Telco Federal Credit Union in Cornelius on December 29 . Constant is facing charges of robbery with a dangerous weapon, making a false bomb threat, evading arrest and failure to identify. He is being held on $70,000 bond. Benoit Constant is suspected of robbing the Carolinas Telco Federal Credit Union in Cornelius on December 29, reported WCNC. Surveillance video from inside the bank showed a white man in dark sunglasses, a baseball cap and blue gloves pointing a handgun at a bank teller with one hand while holding a bag for the cash in the other. Partner in crime: Milandra Constant, Benoit's alleged accomplice, has been charged with making a false bomb threat to create a diversion during the robbery . During the heist, someone also called in a false bomb threat to the Lake Norman YMCA on the other side of town, in what investigators believe was a diversion created by Constant's accomplice to draw police away from the credit union. CCTV cameras captured images of the same silver van with a Delaware registration near the targeted bank and the YMCA, which officials later tracked down to Maryland about a week after the robbery. Constant's alleged partner in crime, Milandra Constant, was behind the wheel of the vehicle. Inside, police found a lifelike mask resembling the bank robber and the striped bag seen in the surveillance footage, according to WSOC-TV. At around 11.30am on Sunday, Benoit Constant was traveling southbound on US-28 in Wichita Falls, Texas, when state troopers stopped his Lexus for a traffic violation. Constant initially gave the troopers a fake name, but when they ran his plates, they found out that the motorist was wanted in North Carolina on robbery charges. The 28-year-old man bolted out of the car and tried to flee on foot but was quickly apprehended in a residential neighborhood. The suspected bank robber is currently awaiting extradition to North Carolina to face charges in connection to the December heist. Milandra Constant, the man's alleged accomplice, has been charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon and making a false bomb threat.

"A woman is set to marry after falling in love with the driver who crashed into her car while she was parked waiting for her husband to return. Ranette Afonso, 42, will marry Marko Conte, 30, this October after they fell head over wheels in love and moved in together within two months of the fateful bump. Ranette, from north London, who has a 21-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter with the husband from whom she is now divorced, said: 'I was waiting for my husband, who had popped into the bank, when I noticed a sporty Nissan Skyline trying to squeeze into a tiny space behind me. Ranette Afonso, 42 (right), is set to marry Marko Conte, 30 (left), in October after they met thanks to a car accident in August 2013 . Ranette (pictured left) was married at the time of the accident, but her and Marko (pictured right) began dating shortly after her marriage ended . 'I felt a massive thud and I knew a car had crashed into me - I was fuming. 'When Marko stepped out I was angry with him for being so careless. The car is his pride and joy so we spent a few minutes arguing with each other about who was to blame. 'At the same time, I found him really attractive and as we swapped insurance and contact details - I could somehow tell the feeling was mutual.' Ranette's 20-year marriage was already coming to an end by the time Marko unexpectedly came into her life at the end of August 2013. Ranette, a laywer, said: 'We had been together for a long time, but we had reached the end of our marriage. We both knew it. 'As I drove back home with my husband beside me I couldn't get Marko out of my mind. Five days after the incident I sent him an email asking how is bumper was and, before I knew it, we were texting each other regularly. Marko's car suffered notable damage after crashing into Ranette's parked car back in August 2013 . After the accident, the pair exchanged insurance and contact details and began to text regularly . 'I soon discovered that we had so much in common and, as things were not going so well between my husband, I found myself drifting closer and closer towards Marko.' Two days later Marko was surprised when Ranette sent him a text telling him she had suddenly split from her husband. Marko, a car hire company owner, invited her to stay with him while she made arrangements for her new life. He said: 'It was completely unexpected. After she arrived on my doorstep we had one of the best weekends of my life. 'There was so much passion between us - I knew we had a connection. We're both passionate people.' Ranette eventually moved in with her sister but still saw Marko frequently on dates. And they continued sending each other flirty texts using the contact numbers they had swapped for insurance purposes. Lawyer Ranette Afonso, 42 (pictured) was married

"(CNN)This is the time of the year when Christians the world over -- more than 2 billion of us -- reflect upon the crucifixion and resurrection of our Lord. In light of the tragic massacre of Christian college students in Kenya on Thursday, and the ongoing threat against Christians in other nations, this Holy Week we are calling upon Christians to also reflect upon the crucifixion, beheading, stoning, enforced slavery, sexual abuse, human trafficking, harassment, bombing and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Christians -- and others -- whose faith alone has made them a target of religious extremists. Countless lives have been utterly destroyed in nations such as Iraq, Syria, Libya, Pakistan, India, Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria. In June 2012, Bishop Shlemon Warduni of Iraq told the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, ""We beg you to help. We want only peace, security, and freedom. Please no more death, no more explosions, no more injustice."" By then, nearly every remaining church in Iraq had constructed a blast wall around its building to buffet the threat of the inevitable church bombing. This crisis escalated substantially last summer when ISIS swept like lightning through Iraq's Nineveh province, capturing the country's second-largest city, Mosul; a city that was until 2014 a home of a thriving Christian community, there centuries before Islam. Again and again the world did not respond as it might have, and now the inconceivable has happened: Iraq's Nineveh Plain has been emptied of its ancient Christianity community, which existed there for more than 1,500 years. On March 27, in a presentation to the U.N. Security Council, Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako referred to the present reality of his fellow Iraqi Christians as a ""catastrophic situation."" He's right. Rarely since the first century has the church in the East faced persecution on this scale. Christian communities that took 2,000 years to build, and that were started by the apostles themselves, lie in ashes between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Survivors waste away as refugees, often in deplorable conditions, with no homes or churches to return to if the region eventually stabilizes. Whether they be Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant, Christian communities are united in what Pope Francis has called an ""ecumenism of blood,"" recognizing that Christianity is experiencing more martyrdom today than in the first century. This is not an exaggerated or contrived crisis. As Nina Shea, director of the Hudson's Institute's Center for Religious Freedom, has aptly put it, ""Piece by piece, Middle Eastern Christianity is being shattered."" Our concern is not to the exclusion of anyone else under threat by these religious fanatics, and we reject those who believe that this evil is reflective of the majority of Muslims whose community has actually experienced the most casualties in this conflict. It is also true that Christianity faces a legitimate threat of extinction in several parts of Iraq and Syria and it faces a growing threat in nations such as Nigeria. In solidarity with those being threatened we agree with the words delivered by Jordan's King Abdullah II at the United

"An ex-Alabama police officer faces ten years in prison after being indicted on a federal charge following a violent confrontation with an Indian grandfather. Eric Sloan Parker, 26, of Toney was charged with one felony count of using unreasonable force by a federal grand jury on Thursday. Sureshbhai Patel, 57, was left partially paralyzed after being slammed face-first during the confrontation in February, which was captured on camera.

Ex-Alabama officer Eric Sloan Parker, 26, has been indicted on one felony count of using unreasonable force following the violent confrontation with an Indian grandfather in February .

Parker plans to plead not guilty, said defense attorney Robert Tuten. 'We are shocked, disappointed and overwhelmed by all the ways Eric Parker is coming under attack,' Tuten said in an email. 'However, we are looking forward to seeing the indictment and having our day in court.' Parker is scheduled to appear in court on April 15 for an evidentiary hearing. 'Police officers are sworn to uphold the law and protect the public,' said U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance in a statement on Friday. 'The public must be able trust the police.' The former officer was fired last month from the Madison City Police Department following the incident. Patel, who has suffered from partial paralysis, was visiting relatives when police were called to a suburban neighborhood where he was walking on February 6. He had only been in the country for two weeks, arriving so he could help take care of his 17-month-old grandson.

"The real-life Paddington bear who suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and fur is closer to finding a new home, thanks to the generosity of Mail on Sunday readers. After the plight of Cholita was highlighted by this newspaper last week, readers donated an extraordinary £30,000 to Animal Defenders International, which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in Peru earlier this month. The elderly bear lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus, where she was kept in a 5ft by 5ft box, and her teeth were broken and her claws removed to prevent her from defending herself. Scroll down for video . Cholita (pictured) lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus in Peru . Cholita - known as the real-life Paddington bear (pictured) - suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and fur . The money raised will allow the organisation to travel more than 600 miles on treacherous mountain and desert roads, which are often little more than dirt tracks, to reach the bear in a zoo near the north-western city of Piura and drive her to the Peruvian capital, Lima. The two drivers and the truck, equipped with a new cage, hay and blankets, will alone cost £2,700, and the bear will also need help from veterinary staff and a support team, who will fly to Piura in advance. When the organisation has cleared the red tape needed to allow Cholita to leave the country, they will fly her and 33 lions they have rescued from other circuses in South America to the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado in the United States, where she can live out her days in peace. Because she is a spectacled bear, the same endangered species as Paddington in the children’s books by Michael Bond, there are stringent conditions to be met before the authorities permit her to cross state boundaries. The organisation, which campaigns against the exploitation of wild animals, will have to delay Cholita’s flight by several weeks to ensure she is allowed aboard, at a further cost of thousands of pounds a day, so it is still appealing for funds. Its president, Jan Creamer, said: ‘We have been overwhelmed by the response from Mail on Sunday readers to help Cholita. We now need one last push so that she can begin her journey to freedom. Please give generously and help us save Cholita and give her the life she deserves.’ Mail on Sunday readers donated an extraordinary £30,000 to Animal Defenders International, which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in Peru earlier this month .

"Spy chiefs have been told by MPs to recruit middle-aged mothers because they are 'emotionally intelligent' and skilled at relationships. The Intelligence and Security Committee said MI5, MI6 and GCHQ should start advertising on the Mumsnet website. An inquiry by the MPs and peers on the committee found that action was needed to break through the 'permafrost' of middle-aged men dominating the ranks of the intelligence agencies who have a 'very traditional male mentality and outlook'. Hermione Norris plays a former MI6 officer - called Ros Myers - who joins an MI5 counter-terrorism division in the TV show Spooks . Across the three agencies, women make up 37 per cent of the workforce but hold only 19 per cent of the most senior roles. Labour's Hazel Blears, who sits on the ISC, said yesterday that recruiting a greater number of women would make the security services better at their job. She highlighted the particular skills mothers have in building relationships – a vital talent for spies trying to recruit informants. 'Women who have had children and brought their families up, they have valuable life experience,' the former Home Office minister said. The dominance of men, by contrast, 'can reinforce a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career', she said. Women deliver a 'more consultative, collaborative approach'. Labour MPs Hazel Blears said more women spies were needed . Mrs Blears said: 'If all intelligence professionals are cut from the same cloth – sharing similar backgrounds and characteristics – then they are likely to share 'unacknowledged biases' that will circumscribe both the definition of problems and the search for solutions.' According to the inquiry, her view that women can make for a better working environment for spies was backed by Sir Iain Lobban, the former director of GCHQ, the listening agency. 'I find that the discussions are deeper, I think they are more emotionally intelligent and, if you like, I think there is more intuition in the room,' he said. Mrs Blears said the need for MI6 officers to be able to deploy abroad – sometimes at short notice – could be a problem for women with children. She added: 'There is a bit of testosterone in the system that says, 'Tickets, money, passport – we all have to get there'. And if you've got children, finding 24-hour childcare is often very difficult.' Mrs Blears also revealed that the BBC TV drama Spooks had made it harder for MI5 to recruit women . A string of its female characters met a grisly end, such as being blown apart trying to rescue a Home Secretary from a bomb. Daniel Craig and the Italian actress Monica Bellucci pose during a photocall on location for the shooting of the 24th James Bond movie 'Spectre' in Rome . In a report out today the ISC will call for a number of reforms to be introduced within the next 12 months across the agencies, including culture change, help for women who have had children to stop them being sidelined and

"Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today. Almost one in three crimes is ‘inappropriately’ punished with a police caution or penalty notice, including some that carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, such as rape, MPs say. Some 86,000 offences that could have gone before a Crown Court were dealt with out of court in the year to June 2014, they add. Revelation: Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today . The Home Affairs Select Committee points to an ‘alarming’ rise of the caution culture – which grew and peaked under the Labour government – and says this has damaged public confidence in the justice system. The committee’s report concludes that too often, police used cautions as a ‘time-saving tool’ rather than the correct way of tackling an offence. In total, police issued 318,500 of the so-called out-of-court disposals, mostly for minor offences, in 2013-14, down from 660,965 in 2008. Despite ministers insisting cautions are ‘inappropriate’ for serious offences, 70 sexual and violent offenders a week received one in the past four years. Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said: ‘The inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences is unacceptable. ‘It is alarming that they are not being used in the correct way in up to 30 per cent of cases. ‘We cannot allow the misuse of out-of-court disposals in serious cases to continue. The public deserve to feel reassured that their local police forces are not tackling serious crimes with a slap on the wrist.’ Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said the 'inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences unacceptable. The committee also says the use of cautions has resulted in a ‘postcode lottery’. In Gwent, 49 per cent of offences were brought to justice, compared with 26 per cent in West Yorkshire. At the peak, one in ten of all solved cases was dealt with by out-of-court disposals. By last year, it had fallen to fewer than one in 20. The report found that cautions could save the police time and money by cutting bureaucracy, allowing front-line officers to spend more time pounding the beat. Arresting an offender takes almost three hours of police time, and charging someone takes five hours. But too many cautions were being handed out ‘inappropriately’, says the committee. The report welcomes reforms being introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling that will end the caution culture which led to criminals being let off with a warning. Six types of out-of-court disposals will be replaced with just two which are designed to compel offenders to make some form of reparation. Minor criminals will be told they must apologise to victims or repair damage they have caused to prevent a court appearance. More serious offenders will be give a ‘suspended prosecution’, which means they must meet a set of conditions such

"Six Minnesota men have been charged with terrorism in a criminal complaint unsealed Monday, the latest Westerners accused of traveling or attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped. Scroll down for video . Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, and Adnan Abdihamid Farah, both 19, and their four co-accused have been described as close friends who met secretly to plan their travel to Syria . Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, and the five other men arrested have been accused of being 'intent' on joining ISIS . Charged are Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20. 'These were focused men who were intent on joining a terrorist organization,' Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said at a news conference Monday. The six were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest people from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of Westerners by IS. Authorities said earlier that a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year, and at least one has died. Three of those charged in the newest complaint - Mohamed Farah, Abdurahman and Musse - were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with 19-year-old Hamza Ahmed, but they were not charged until now. Ahmed was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to IS, and attempting to provide material support. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of six Somali-American men from Minnesota, accused of trying to join ISIS. Above, FBI Special Agent Richard R Thornton details the arrests at a press conference, with U.S. Attorney Andrew M Luger to the left . Despite being stopped already, Luger said, the three others continued to try to get to Syria to join IS 'by any means possible.' The complaint describes several interactions some of the men had with Abdi Nur, a Minnesota man charged previously with conspiracy to provide support to a terror organization. The complaint says Nur, 'from his locale in Syria, recruits individuals and provides assistance to those who want to leave Minnesota to fight abroad.' The complaint relies in part on material from a confidential informant who had himself conspired to join IS before he changed his mind and went to authorities. Some of the informant's conversations with the six men were recorded. The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U.S. Since

"Kevin Pietersen is still on track to play in this summer's Caribbean Premier League for the St Lucia Zouks. Organisers confirmed the schedule on Tuesday, in a press release which lists Pietersen as one of its stars - alongside West Indies big-hitter Chris Gayle, Martin Guptill and Jacques Kallis among others. Pietersen negotiated a release from the majority of his Indian Premier League contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad next month and in May so that he could agree a new contract with Surrey. Kevin Pietersen negotiated a release from his IPL contract so that he could agree a new contract with Surrey . Pietersen has been in Australia for the Cricket World Cup and this picture suggests he is struggling with jetlag . The superstar batsman, sacked by England last year after their Ashes whitewash defeat, is hoping a return to four-day county cricket may yet pave the way for a Test recall. New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves has hinted that could be a possibility, if Pietersen performs well. The 34-year-old has said he will 'do anything' to play for England again, and dreams of being back for this summer's Ashes rematch - a series which runs from July 8 to August 24. Pietersen agreed in the close season to return to play for the Zouks, as he did last summer. His commitments for them may, however, clash with part of the Ashes - or his hopes of continuing to press his claims with runs for Surrey. The South African-born batsman hasn't given up on receiving a call-up for the Ashes Tests this summer . The CPL season begins on June 20 and ends on July 26 and the tournament's international director of cricket, Tom Moody, is confident Pietersen will be there. 'At this stage he sees himself very much as part of the CPL, he's made the commitment and will have played a lot of county cricket at that time,' he told the CPL's official website. 'We don't see that changing, he hasn't indicated that's going to be the case (to pull out) but if he's suddenly picked in an Ashes Test match that's all going to change very quickly. 'I think that is probably not a realistic target for him unless something dramatic happens between now and then. It's going to be hard for him, there's a lot of hurdles to be overcome; one, form, which will be his easiest hurdle; two, his fitness and three is his building bridges. There are many to be built after what has been said from both parties over a long period of time.' Pietersen shared a picture of himself celebrating Australia's World Cup win with James Faulkner .

"Students, parents and staff at a Melbourne high school are horrified after the discovery students have been drinking treated sewage water from a bubbler on campus for more than a year. In a letter sent to all parents during the school holidays, the principal of St Peter’s College in Cranbourne East, Tim Hogan admitted that ‘Class A’ recycled water had been inadvertently connected to an outdoor drinking fountain. The bubbler had been dispensing recycled water for 16 months– from December 17 2013 until April 1 2015. ‘The cross-connection came to our attention through the maintenance staff of the College on the 30th of March, 2015,’ Mr Hogan wrote in the letter, issued on April 14. Unfortunately for students, ‘Class A’ recycled water is sewage that has been treated to a standard that’s safe for watering gardens, washing clothes and flushing toilets. Students at Melbourne high school St Peter's College were drinking from a bubbling dispensing recycled water for more than a year . Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption. Whilst drinking the water, the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite, Cryptosporidium. An investigation has been launched by the Department of Health and Human Services to assess the extent of the possible health impact on the students. The principal assured students, parents and staff that the drinking fountain was shut down on April 1 and is no longer in use. The other 20 bubblers at the school have been tested and none show traces of recycled water. The ongoing investigation will determine the number of students who have drunk from the water foundation since it became contaminated. Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption . ‘The Department has advised that drinking the Class A recycled water may have led to a slightly increased risk of gastro,’ the principal warned. However, preliminary testing of the chemicals present in the drinking water from the bubbler found that ‘the vast majority were at very low concentrations’, meaning the student were unlikely to have been harmed from consuming the water. Daily Mail Australia spoke with a number of parents of St Peter's students. All the parents were unaware of any cases of gastro or anyone who believed they'd been adversely affected by the bubbler. A Health Department official will be on site at the school on Thursday April 16 to respond to concerns the parents may have. ‘If anyone is suffering from a gastrointestinal illness and experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, they should seek advice from their GP,’ Mr Hogan advised. Families and staff are being encouraged to contact the Department of Health & Human Services on 1300 761 874.

"Cristiano Ronaldo shed tears of joy when he finally usurped Lionel Messi as the Ballon d’Or winner for 2013. He was also officially crowned the world’s best player, above Messi, for 2014. But here’s the bad news, Cristiano. Despite the gongs and the widely-held opinion that Ronaldo was superior to his great rival over the past two years, Messi still contributed more valuable goals to his club and country in 2013 and 2014. That is the view of the number-crunchers at The Economist, who have calculated the worth of each player's goals, based on how crucial the goal was to the match result (and the subsequent gains from that result), as well as the importance of the game. Lionel Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) in action during last Sunday's El Clasico duel . Messi's Barcelona beat Ronaldo's Real Madrid 2-1 at the Nou Camp, with the Portuguese scoring . The explanations of the precise formulas used and the value of certain matches in relation to others are both long and complicated, so to read them in full click here. Sportsmail’s calculator also seems to be broken, so again to see the full numbers, let The Economists’s boffins guide you through. Be warned, though: the introduction contains a reference to 'The Pythagorean Formula Extended for Soccer', so it’s not for the faint-hearted. But the key facts are these. Messi’s (still fantastic) total of 86 goals over the period does not compare with Ronaldo's superhuman 105. Ronaldo shed tears of joy when he won the Ballon d'Or over Messi in 2013 . The Real Madrid hero stripped off to celebrate his goal in the Champions League final last season . But Ronaldo's penalty against Atletico Madrid was virtually worthless, according to The Economist . Each of Ronaldo’s 105 goals, however, were worth an average of 0.40 points to his team in relation to the most likely result of the match before the goal was scored. By contrast, Messi’s 86 goals were worth an average of 0.47 points each. And if that sounds like gobbledegook, essentially this can be explained in simple terms: a goal in a match where the score is tied 1-1 in the final minutes yields more points (or aggregate value in cup ties) to his team than a goal scored in a match where the player's team is already winning 3-1. The Economist uses Ronaldo’s three goals in the semi-final and final of last year’s Champions League as an example to show their relative lack of value. In the second leg of the semi-final against Bayern Munich, Ronaldo scored when Real led 3-0 and 4-0 on aggregate. And in the final against Atletico Madrid, his penalty in extra-time when Madrid were 3-1 ahead had a virtually negligible value. Messi has rediscovered his best form this season after losing out to Ronaldo since 2013 . Messi is on international duty with Argentina and is pictured here training in Washington . Messi was all smiles here at the 2013 awards nominations but Ronaldo walked off with the prize . The importance of

"Diet Pepsi will no longer contain the sweetener aspartame due to customer fears over its safety . Diet Pepsi will no longer contain the sweetener aspartame due to customer fears over its safety. The controversial sweetener has been linked to a range of health problems, although research has shown it to be safe. PepsiCo said today it is dropping the ingredient from the popular drink in the U.S. in response to customer feedback. Diet Pepsi, Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi and Wild Cherry Diet Pepsi will now contain sucralose, another artificial sweetener commonly known as Splenda. The decision to swap sweeteners comes as after a decade of plummeting sales. Consumers have shifted away from diet drinks because of perceived health concerns about artificial sweeteners, specifically aspartame. The ingredient, used in fizzy drinks and diet products, has been at the centre of critical reports dating back decades linking it to everything from cancer to premature birth. This is despite the Food and Drug Administration stating that more than 100 studies support aspartame's safety. However these assurances have failed to convince some people, who continue to report adverse reactions, such as headaches and nausea after consuming foods containing the sweetener. The sweetener, which is about 200 times sweeter than sugar, is widely used to sweeten diet sodas. It is also used by rival Coca-Cola Co in its drinks such as Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Schweppes Diet Lemonade. In a statement today, PepsiCo said: 'Diet cola drinkers in the U.S. told us they wanted aspartame-free Diet Pepsi and we're delivering.' The reformulated drinks will begin appearing on shelves in August. Sales in PepsiCo's beverage business have been hurt by a long-term decline in soft drink sales in the United States. And Coca-Cola said this week that sales volume for Diet Coke fell 5 percent in North America in the first three months of the year. Executives at Coke and Pepsi blame the declines on perceptions that aspartame, first sold under the brand name Nutrasweet, is not safe. Consumers have shifted away from diet drinks because of perceived health concerns about artificial sweeteners, specifically aspartame . Despite aspartame's poor reputation, it has been ruled a safe food ingredient by food watchdogs in Britain, the EU, the USA and around the world. Last month, a study commissioned by Britain’s food watchdog found eating the sweetener had no impact on the body or behaviour of people who claimed to be sensitive to it. Aspartame has established itself as an important component in many low-calorie, sugar-free foods and beverages and is primarily responsible for the growth over the last two decades in the sugar-free market. It is currently consumed by over 200 million people around the world and is found in more than 6,000 products. These include carbonated soft drinks, powdered soft drinks, chewing gum, dessert mixes, puddings and fillings, frozen desserts, yogurt, tabletop sweeteners, and some pharmaceuticals such as vitamins and sugar-free cough drops. Aspartame is a nutritive sweetener made by joining two amino acids (protein components) -- L-phenylalanine and L-aspartic acid, with a third component called a methyl

"If you're looking for the ultimate Easter egg-stravaganza, London's Studio Kitchen at K West Hotel have obliged, with a sweet treat inspired by one of our most popular chocolates. But if the thought of a Crème Egg Burger has your tastebuds recoiling at the horror of a meat patty slathered in crème egg filling, relax - this burger is made entirely from confectionery. And this Frankenstein food - created specially for Easter by chefs in the Studio Kitchen burger lab, K West Hotel & Spa in Shepherds Bush, West London - will be available throughout spring. Scroll down for video . The Crème Egg Burger is more sweet treat than meat feast, with chocolate covered brioche buns, a melted chocolate Crème Egg 'patty', plus strawberry jam filling and lashings of mascarpone cream . Sure to send sugar levels soaring, the mini slider burgers see a gooey melted crème egg playing the part of the patty, slathered in 'ketchup' made from strawberry jelly and sitting on a bed of thickly spread mascarpone cream. Then of course, there are the buns. Slices of sweet brioche, the top layer is dunked in melted white chocolate for a thorough coating, before being sprinkled with colourful hundreds and thousands. More sweet treat that meaty feast, the burgers have gone straight to the top of the Studio Kitchen dessert menu, priced at £5.50 for a portion of two. Served from the end of March 2015 and throughout spring in celebration of Easter, the burgers also appear in the hotel's decadent Spring Rocks Afternoon Tea. The Easter creation follows public outrage over the change in chocolate recipe for classic Cadbury's Crème Eggs. Changes to the classic Dairy Milk chocolate recipe used in Cadbury Crème Eggs sparked public outrage in January, as shoppers were told a sweeter 'standard cocoa mix chocolate' would be used instead this year . A spokesperson for Cadbury, bought by American giant Kraft in 2010, revealed back in January that the nation's favourite chocolate egg will no longer be coated in Dairy Milk. An official announcement stated, 'It’s no longer Dairy Milk. It is similar, but not exactly Dairy Milk.' Chefs at the Studio Kitchen aren't the first to turn Britain's best-loved Easter treat into a new concoction. In 2013 a flury of alcoholic cocktails appeared in bars and clubs, mixing the gooey centre and melted chocolate with spirits and liquor. While The Mint Bar at Ireland's Westin Dublin Hotel served a Creme Egg Cocktail, London's Jewel Bar in Piccadilly Circus mixed-up a chocolatey Creme Egg mojito, which contained almost 1,000 calories. In 2013 The Mint Bar at Dublin's Westin Dublin Hotel served the limited edition Creme Egg Cocktail, mixing vanilla infused Grey Goose Vodka and chocolate-bean flavoured Crème De Cacao, with white chocolate liqueur, cream and mini Cadbury Crème Eggs .

"Death by drugs: Luke Goodman, 23, died in Colorado over the weekend after he took too many marijuana edibles and shot himself in the head . A popular college graduate died this past weekend in Colorado, after his family say he took too many marijuana candies and killed himself. Luke Goodman, 23, of Tulsa, Oklahoma ate four times the prescribed amount of a peach tart marijuana edible candy in addition to a THC-laced red velvet cookie and proceeded to shoot himself in the head with a gun he brought on the trip for protection. Goodman's family say he was a charismatic and outgoing young man who never showed signs of depression or suicidal thoughts before. They blame his death solely on the edibles. 'It was 100 per cent the drugs. It was completely because of the drugs - he had consumed so much of it,' his mother Kim Goodman told CBS Denver. Goodman was on a two-week ski trip with his family and friends when his parents dropped him off at the bus stop Saturday to go snowboarding with his cousin, Caleb Fowler. Goodman's parents were on their way back to Tulsa, and their son was going to spend the rest of the trip with his cousin. During their day out, Goodman and Fowler went to Silverthorne where the two purchased $78 worth of pot and edibles. They then went back to their lodgings and proceeded to get high. Fowler says his cousin started off by eating two peach tart candies at the same time - despite the fact that the suggested dosage is just one candy. Each candy contains 10mg of THC - the active ingredient in marijuana. When Goodman didn't immediately feel the effects of the drug, he took two more and also ate red velvet cookie baked with marijuana (his cousin had three cookies). Goodman's mother fears her son didn't read the warning label on the candies, which say the effects can take hours to kick in. Scroll down for video . Too much: Goodman's cousin Caleb Fowler says he ate five peach tart edibles, which is five times the suggested dosage. Above a stock image of a peach tart edible. It's unclear the specific brand Goodman ingested . Several hours later, Goodman's behavior changed drastically and he became jittery, incoherent and started talking nonsensically. 'He would make eye contact with us but didn’t see us, didn’t recognize our presence almost. He had never got close to this point, I had never seen him like this,' Fowler said. Apparently unaware of his serious condition, Fowler left Goodman in the condo to hop in the hot tub with other members of their vacation party. Only his cousin's mother was in the apartment, when Goodman grabbed his handgun, which he traveled with for protection, and shot himself. The single shot was fired just five minutes after Fowler left Goodman to use the hot tub.

"British families now have more cash to spend after tax than before the Coalition came to power, official figures revealed this morning. The boost, just 37 days before the election, came as separate figures showed that Britain's economy grew faster than any other major rich country in the world last year. People's confidence in their own finances also jumped to complete a 'hat trick of good news' for David Cameron and George Osborne this morning. Scroll down for video . In the final three months of the year, families had £4,187 to spend or save – finally overtaking the £4,187 families had left over at the time of the last election . Britain's economy grew faster than any other major rich country in the world last year, official figures revealed this morning . The Office for National Statistics said the UK economy grew 0.6 per cent in the last three months of the year – 0.1 per cent more than previously thought. But over the whole of 2014, the economy boomed by 2.8 per cent – faster than America, Germany, France and every other country in the G7 group of rich countries. Mr Osborne said the revised figures show the UK is 'clearly fastest growing major advanced economy' in the world. Separate figures released this morning revealed that in the final three months of the year, the average voter had £4,187 left over after tax, up 1.8 per cent on the previous quarter. Mr Osborne said this meant that living standards were now officially higher than at the last election, when real disposable income was £4,187. The Chancellor said: 'Today we've got a hat-trick of good news about the British economy and with 37 days to go the election it's another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk.' The Chancellor George Osborne, pictured at a Pizza Express restaurant in Hove this morning, claimed the economic figures were a triple dose of good news . David Cameron was out campaigning at a building site at Sainsbury's head office in Holborn, central London, this morning . The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew 0.6 per cent in the last three months of the year – 0.1 per cent more than previously thought . He added: 'We've had a significant upgrade to GDP, the highest consumer confidence for over 12 years and confirmation that living standards are higher than they were at the last election. 'This is good news for families and businesses across the country. 'So voters now face a stark choice: do we stick with a plan which is working, delivering growth and jobs, or do we put all that at risk with Ed Miliband whose policies of more spending, more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos.' GDP per head – the wealth of each Briton rather than the economy as a whole – was also estimated to have increased in the last three months of the year – jumping by a healthy 0.5 per cent.

"Former US representative Anthony Weiner was spotted taking his son for a quick stroll amid claims his wife has been caught up in the Hillary Clinton email scandal. The 50-year-old house husband was seen pushing three-year-old Jordan on the swings at a playground near to his house in downtown Manhattan yesterday. The pair later rushed across town to get pizza. Former US representative Anthony Weiner was spotted taking his son for a quick stroll near his downtown Manhattan home yesterday. They were seen enjoying themselves amid claims Weiner's wife has been caught up in the Hillary Clinton email scandal . They were spotted enjoying themselves as Weiner's wife Huma Abedin faces scrutiny about using a private email account. Abedin is one of three top Clinton aides who reportedly used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state's private server. Senior figures in Congress were already investigating Clinton's communications from 2009-13, which they say were not conducted via official State Department accounts but a 'clintonemail.com' address. Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of communications from the time - but admitted on Tuesday during a news conference that she deleted more than 30,000 emails she decided were personal in nature and unrelated to her job. The 50-year-old house husband made sure he pushed three-year-old Jordan high on the swings before the pair ran off to get pizza . The investigation has now widened after it emerged that one of Abedin's email addresses is Huma@clintonemail.com, showing that she could have also been using the server to conduct official business. Daily Mail Online confirmed the address through Lexis-Nexis, a commercial service that compiles public records. It comes nearly four years after Weiner's own scandal where he resigned from Congress for sending sexually suggestive photographs of himself via his public Twitter account to other women. Longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Abedin (left), shown with then-Secretary of State Clinton during a 2010 diplomatic meeting in Vietnam, was her deputy chief of staff and is expected to play a key roll if Clinton runs for president . At the time he admitted that he had sent images to six women in three years and said that he had stopped. But in 2013 further claims were made that he sent more under the alias 'Carlos Danger' to a 22-year-old woman. He tried to return to politics by taking part in the 2013 New York Mayoral race but lost after receiving less than five per cent of votes.

"Arsenal are searching for a fourth consecutive Premier League win at Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday night as they look to chase down second-placed Manchester City. With a nine-point gap to leaders Chelsea, the title looks to be beyond Arsene Wenger's men yet again despite their recent good form. But would finishing as runners-up to Jose Mourinho's men be good enough for a club with 13 titles to its name? Arsenal fan Lee Hurley of blog Daily Cannon tells us whether coming second would be a success for the Gunners. Just four points from second place, Arsenal haven’t finished that high in the league for 10 years and it can be no coincidence that their surge to catch the oil-rich Manchester City comes after the Emirates-austerity period has ended. But while it represents an improvement in the eyes of fans, it can’t be the end of Arsenal’s ambitions and it won’t be seen as success in its own right. This is a club that wins titles, 13 of them for those who think football was just invented in 2005 when Chelsea decided to start buying trophies as they couldn’t win them any other way. Arsenal players look dejected during the Monaco defeat as they now face a daunting second leg comeback . Arsene Wenger found it painful viewing as his Arsenal side capitulated in a 3-1 defeat by Monaco . Alexis Sanchez has been a star performer for the Gunners this season as they seek a top-two finish . In a league that contains clubs who have been outspending Arsenal significantly, to finish second is not to be sniffed at and had it not been for the crippling injury problems that afflicted Arsenal, again, at the start of this season, who knows how much closer to Chelsea they might have been. But that’s how it’s been with Arsenal over the past 10 years – a severe case of the ‘might have beens’ – what might have been had they not lost so many top players to City and Barcelona and United, or if Laurent Koscielny and Wojciech Szczesny not been monumental idiots in the League Cup final, or the oil money not flooded in as soon as the club lay the foundations for the Emirates or Eduardo’s leg not been snapped in 2008 when Arsenal were running away with the league or last season when injuries did the same, albeit in a less dramatic fashion. Or, or, or.... If I’m honest, it's all got a little tedious for many fans, which is why the FA Cup success last season was celebrated so wildly – a nice little change of pace from finishing fourth and embarrassing ourselves in the knockouts. The departures of Thierry Henry (left) and Cesc Fabregas (right) to Barcelona in the past were huge blows . Arsenal players Mathieu Flamini (left), Olivier Giroud (middle) and Aaron Ramsey (right) celebrate FA Cup success in May 2014 - the club's ended a nine-year trophy drought .

"A down-on-their-luck couple from Ohio struggling with chronic conditions that left them unable to make a living were found dead from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning this week, less than two months after their desperate pleas for help went ignored. Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, created online fundraisers on GiveFroward.com and GoFundMe.com in late February begging Good Samaritans for financial help. Mrs Speidel wrote that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and were close to having their electricity and Internet service shut off. Hopeless: Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, Ohio, took their own lives this week, more than two months after they created online fundraisers begging for financial help . Heartbreaking: The middle-aged couple died from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning caused by two charcoal grills they had dragged into their bedroom . Last-ditch effort: Mrs Speidel wrote on GiveForward.com in late February that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and cut down their food intake to one meal a day . After having paid $500 to their landlord to prevent their immediate eviction, Mrs Speidel stated that they were left with only $33 to their name. To stretch their meager funds a little farther, the impoverished, ailing couple were forced to limit their food intake to a single meal a day and did not have enough scraps to feed their two cats. ‘I have turned in every direction possible and don’t know what else to do,’ she wrote. ‘If you can help, we will be forever grateful and will even pay you back once we get back on our feet.’ The Speidles were hoping to raise $1,000, but the online campaign failed to draw any donations whatsoever. On Tuesday, the couple's landlord, Doug Elleman, arrived at their rental at 225 West High Avenue to discover a pink handwritten note warning passersby of carbon monoxide inside, reported Bellefontaine Examiner. Firefighters who were called to the scene entered the residence and discovered a pair of charcoal grills filled with smoldering coals. Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were pronounced dead at the scene. Orpahns: The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa (pictured right as a baby with her father) and 20-year-old Kira Speidel . Columbus Dispatch reported that a note found nearby confirmed that the husband and wife had made a suicide pact. The couple had removed their beloved pet cats from the house to spare their lives. They were later found wandering outside. The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa and Kira Speidel. In a post left last month on her parents' GoFundMe.com page, which has since been removed, 20-year-old Kira called the couple 'the hardest-working people I know.' She went on to say that now that they can no longer work because of their physical ailments, 'they have nowhere to run.' Police Chief Brandon Standley said the town has resources available for people in need like the Speidels, adding that it's tragic that they thought they were all out of options. In one of her online pleas,

As a parting shot, Nichols refuses to refer to the fight's date in normal English and repeatedly says it will be staged on 'May two, May two!'.

Paris are going to come here to score goals. It'll be a very complicated game. We're ready, and we hope to win in front of our fans. We'll have to see the tactics the coach puts in place.

"John Travolta has broken his silence on the controversial Scientology exposé Going Clear and says he never intends to watch the documentary. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times while promoting his upcoming film The Forger, Travolta said his decades of personal experience in the organization have been nothing but positive--nothing like the blackmailing, physically abusive cult portrayed in the film. 'I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?' he said. Travolta then spoke for the only celebrity whose dealings with Scientology get more screen time in Going Clear than his own, Tom Cruise. Scroll down for video . Spoke out: John Travolta on Monday broke his silence on the Scientology-slamming HBO documentary Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief . 'It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom, I imagine,' he said. 'I've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years...that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative.' Those 40 years Travolta has spent as a Scientologist are addressed head-on in the film, which claims that church elders have blackmailed the 61-year-old into being one of their most visible cheerleaders. But Travolta, despite his refusal to sit through the film, said it's merely a showcase for ex-members 'who were disgruntled with their experiences' with Scientology. 'I've been brought through storms that were insurmountable, and (Scientology has) been so beautiful for me, that I can't even imagine attacking it, . 'Why would I even approach a negative perspective? That would be a crime to me, personally, to do that,' he said. Scientologists hold a 'blackmail file' on John Travolta to stop him leaving the faith, which includes 'damaging material' from his sessions with auditors at the church, the doc claims. Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor - once a member of the Church and the point of contact with John Travolta - described a prison camp where members would be forced to work 30-hour shifts, with around three hours of breaks . The film features a number of allegations about how members are threatened and tortured in prison-style camps and cut off from their family if they decide to leave Scientology. Others belonging to the most senior order of the faith have been forced to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in a fight to secure a chair to stay in the church, it was claimed. The claims have been disputed by the Church of Scientology who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as 'admitted' liars and perjurers and 'professional anti-Scientologists.' Directed by Alex Gibney, Going Clear aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including Travolta and Tom. Perhaps the only celebrity discussed more in the film Going Clear is Tom Cruise, whose marriage to Nicole Kidman the doc claims was picked apart by Scientology elders . It included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive

"Greg Hardy has been suspended by the NFL after an incident of domestic abuse that allegedly occurred last year. Hardy, who signed with the Dallas Cowboys last month, will be forced to sit out the first 10 games of the season and will not receive his salary for these games. This comes almost one year after Hardy, 25, was convicted by a judge in Charlotte, North Carolina of beating, strangling and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend, Nicki Holder. Those charges were later dropped on an appeal when Holder could not be located to testify. Scroll down for video . The NFL announced today that Greg Hardy (above) would be suspended without pay for 10 games at the start of the 2015 season . Hardy (above) was convicted by a judge last July of beating, strangling and threatening to kill ex-girlfriend Nicki Holder . The decision to ban Hardy followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February. Hardy was informed in a letter by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Hardy was dropped by his previous team, the Carolina Panthers, because of these charges last season, but was still able to collect his salary during that time, which was roughly $770,000 a week. 'I understand that I need to step away from football right now and take care of this legal matter,' Hardy said in a statement after he was cut from the Panthers. The Panthers had originally agreed to wait to take action until Hardy had a jury trial regarding the incident in May. His previous conviction was the result of a bench trial. A jury trial that ultimately led to all charges being dropped.Holder told police that Hardy choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his Charlotte condo. Holder (above with hardy) told police that Hardy choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his condo . This all came at a time when the league was under heavy scrutiny in the wake of two abuse scandals involving stars Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Many were upset with the punishments those two received, feeling the NFL was too lenient. Video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. Rice was definitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, has now been suspended by the team. Both men are expected by many to return to play in the 2015, with Peterson back on the Vikings after an NFL decision and Rice winning a wrongful termination suit during

"Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists. Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet. The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found. The eagle talons shown above were found at a site inhabited by Neanderthals and are the earliest example of jewellery yet discovered, according to researchers who have re-examined them 100 years after they were found . The findings will add to mounting evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as. Instead they are emerging as having had a sophisticated culture, were highly intelligent and may have even created art. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly 2 per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. The new findings suggest that the talons may have had a symbolic purpose - something that some anthropologists have argued Neanderthals did not possess or copied off modern humans. However, Dr David Frayer, an anthropologist at the University Kansas who led the study along with colleagues in Croatia, said the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe. He said: 'It's really a stunning discovery. 'It's one of those things that just appeared out of the blue. 'It's so unexpected and it's so startling because there's just nothing like it until very recent times to find this kind of jewellery.' The eight talons were discovered more than 100 years ago at a site where Neanderthal remains have been found just outside the town of Krapina in northern Croatia. The researchers examined the talons and found that four of them bear multiple smooth edged cut marks around the top. Three of the largest talons also have

Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists. Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet. The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found. The findings will add to mounting evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as. Instead they are emerging as having had a sophisticated","

"At first glance, it looks like any other F-16 fighter jet - except for one difference. Boeing's new QF-16 is a actually a retired US Air force jet converted into a drone. The pilotless plane can be controlled from the ground, and will used for target practice by 'top gun' pilots. Scroll down for video . Where's the pilot? Boeing has revealed video footage of an F-16 jet converted into a drone. 126 of the converted planes will be used by the US Air Force as flying targets to train top gun pilots. Length: 49 ft, 5 in. Span: 32 ft, 8 in. Takeoff weight: 37,500 lbs . Max speed: 1,500 mph . Max altitude: 50,000 ft plus . Range: 2,425 mi . Engine: One 27,000-lb-thrust Pratt & Whitney F100 . The first production Boeing QF-16 optionally manned target drone has been delivered to the US Air Force (USAF), Air bosses have revealed. Aircraft QF-007 arrived at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida on 11 March, ahead of being pressed into service by the 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron (ATS). Boeing has delivered six pre-production QF-16s, and in all, the USAF expects to receive 126 QF-16s. The unmanned McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II currently used is no longer truly representative of the air-to-air threats USAF pilots are likely to encounter on future operations. The QF-16 will be able to represent threats in the class of the MiG-29 'Fulcrum' and Sukhoi Su-27 'Flanker', bosses say. In tests, two U.S. Air Force test pilots in a ground control station at Tydall remotely flew the QF-16, which is a retired F-16 jet modified to be an aerial target. While in the air, the QF-16 mission included a series of simulated maneuvers, reaching supersonic speeds, returning to base and landing, all without a pilot in the cockpit. 'It was a little different to see it without anyone in it, but it was a great flight all the way around,' said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Ryan Inman, Commander, 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron. 'It's a replication of current, real world situations and aircraft platforms they can shoot as a target. Now we have a 9G capable, highly sustainable aerial target.' For more than 40 years, the F-16 Fighting Falcon has proven itself as the world's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter, serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world. The drones have been adapted from F-16 jets that have been retired by the Air Force. The QF-16 is a retired F-16 (pictured) turned in a remote controlled drone.

"The U.S. government on Thursday asked an appeals court to lift a temporary hold on President Barack Obama's executive action to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, arguing it can't wait for the judge who blocked the action to make a ruling on a similar request. Justice Department attorneys filed an emergency motion with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, to lift a preliminary injunction issued last month by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas. The injunction had been issued on the request of a coalition of 26 states that filed a lawsuit to overturn Obama's immigration plan. OFF TO COURT: President Barack Obama has responded to a Texas judge's injunction halting his immigration executive actions by demanding an appeals court overrule him . HERE COMES THE JUDGE: Federal jurist Andrew Hanen called the Obama administration on the carpet and put the brakes on the president's immigration plan . The states, led by Texas, argue that Obama's action was unconstitutional and would force them to invest more in law enforcement, health care and education. DECISION TIME: Federal Judge Priscilla Owen will likely make the call on whether to overturn Hanen, her former law school classmate . The injunction was intended to stall Obama's actions – which would spare from deportation as many as 5 million people who are in the U.S. illegally – while the lawsuit progresses through the courts. Many Republicans in Congress and states led by Republicans oppose the action, saying Obama overstepped his authority as president. Obama said he had to act because Congress has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The Justice Department had asked Hanen to lift the injunction while the case was appealed to the 5th Circuit. But Hanen put that request on hold pending a hearing on March 19 to review allegations the government misled him about the implementation of part of the immigration plan. In their 21-page motion, Justice Department attorneys called the injunction 'unprecedented and wrong' and argued lifting it was crucial as the order 'irreparably interferes with (the Homeland Security Department's) ability to protect the Homeland and secure our borders.' Justice Department attorneys said that if the injunction is not lifted, it should at least apply either only to Texas or to the 26 states that sued. 'President Obama's unconstitutional use of executive power to accomplish what he couldn't do in Congress sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the fabric of our Republic,' Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement responding to the Justice Department's emergency motion. 'The state of Texas and a bipartisan coalition of 25 other states will continue to oppose the President's unilateral and lawless actions,' Paxton added. A coalition of 14 states, including California and Iowa, and the District of Columbia filed a motion on Thursday with the 5th Circuit in support of lifting the injunction. They argued the immigration actions will benefit states through increased tax revenues and improved public safety. But Texas has on its side a longer list: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana,

"No-fly list: Chris Roberts, a computer security researcher on his way to give a talk about computer security vulnerabilities at a major conference was told he couldn't fly on United Airlines Saturday, due to comments he'd made on Twitter . United Airlines stopped a prominent security researcher from boarding a California-bound flight late Saturday, following a social media post by the researcher days earlier suggesting the airline's onboard systems could be hacked. The researcher, Chris Roberts, attempted to board a United flight from Colorado to San Francisco to speak at a major security conference there this week, but was stopped by the airline's corporate security at the gate. Roberts founded One World Labs, which tries to discover security risks before they are exploited. Roberts had been removed from a United flight on Wednesday by the FBI after landing in Syracuse, New York, and was questioned for four hours after jokingly suggesting on Twitter he could get the oxygen masks on the plane to deploy. Authorities also seized Roberts' laptop and other electronics, although his lawyer says he hasn't seen a search warrant. A lawyer for Roberts said United gave him no detailed explanation on Saturday why he wasn't allowed on the plane, saying instead the airline would be sending Roberts a letter within two weeks stating why they wouldn't let him fly on their aircraft. 'Given Mr. Roberts' claims regarding manipulating aircraft systems, we've decided it's in the best interest of our customers and crew members that he not be allowed to fly United,' airline spokesman Rahsaan Johnson told The Associated Press. 'However, we are confident our flight control systems could not be accessed through techniques he described.' When asked what threat Roberts posed if United's systems couldn't be compromised, Johnson said Sunday: 'We made this decision because Mr. Roberts has made comments about having tampered with aircraft equipment, which is a violation of United policy and something customers and crews shouldn't have to deal with.' Grounded: United made the decision not to allow Roberts to fly on United 'because he had made public statements about having manipulated airfare equipment and aircraft systems'. In this Tweet, Roberts speculates on whether he should give the command to drop a 737's oxygen masks . Hacking: Once onboard, he pondered on Twitter whether he would be able to hack into the flight's onboard computer settings. In a previous Tweet (seen here) he posted pictures containing details of aircraft data . Concern: Roberts was questioned by FBI agents for four hours. All of his computer equipment, including an iPad, a MacBook Pro, several hard drives and several USB memory sticks were confiscated . Johnson said the airline reached Roberts several hours before his flight to tell him he couldn't fly. But a lawyer for Roberts said Sunday that when his client received that call, the caller would only say he or she was from United, and wouldn't give Roberts a name or callback number. When Roberts then tried calling the number back from his phone's caller ID, it rang instead to a resort hotel, and Roberts

"Cab driver David Perry (pictured), 52, sexually assaulted two women who fell asleep in his taxi . A black cab driver who sexually assaulted young women who fell asleep in his taxi after nights out has been jailed for 10 years. David Perry, 52, attempted to rape his first victim and sexually assaulted the second after climbing into the back of his cab and removing the women's clothing while they slept, in separate attacks some 16 months apart. But Scotland Yard believe the cab driver of 25 years may have preyed on more women and urged potential victims to come forward. Judge John Lafferty said the victims had suffered 'serious psychological harm' as a result of the attacks as he sentenced the father of two to 10 years in prison and a subsequent five-year licence period at Snaresbrook Crown Court. The court heard how Perry told police after his arrest that he had been 'worried about what he might do' because of his high hormone levels after the break-up of a relationship and had sought help from his doctor. The women, in their 20s, were both heavily drunk after socialising in east London when they were assaulted in the early hours of the morning, the first attack in January 2013 and the second in May 2014. Prosecutor Peter Clement told the court that Perry was in a high position of trust when he took of advantage of the women. 'Both victims had been out with friends, both had been drinking and both were at the relevant time highly intoxicated,' he said. 'They were, by virtue of their drunkenness, particularly vulnerable. Their incapacity made them no less deserving than anyone else of being safe. 'They each sought the security and safety they were entitled to expect from a London taxi - a black cab. 'He exploited his passengers' obvious vulnerability for his own sexual gratification. One of the victims, who last remembered being in or around Commercial Road (pictured) in Shoreditch, woke to find herself without her trousers or underwear on and the driver lying beside her . 'Whilst each was asleep in what should have been the safety of his black cab, he stopped, got in to the back of his cab and stripped and sexually assaulted each victim while they slept or were semi-conscious.' In the first attack, the court heard that the victim had been out drinking with friends since lunchtime but could not remember leaving Shoreditch House in Bethnal Green. The woman, who was not in court, said she woke up half-naked in the back of a taxi while the driver was performing a sex act on her. He then twice attempted to have sex with her but was unsuccessful. Perry was sentenced to 10 years in prison and a subsequent five-year licence period at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) She described being unable to focus or rationalise what was happening and was next aware of being at home, where she made a 'hysterical' phone call to a friend, recognising that she had been the victim of a serious sexual

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN)Jaquita Gonzales still tries to call her husband on his cellphone. A pair of work shoes still sits outside the front door of their home in Kuala Lumpur waiting to be reclaimed. His uniform still hangs in a cupboard. Twelve months after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished without a trace, Gonzales hasn't given up hope. She can't. Neither can her children, other family members and friends. Not until there is some conclusive evidence on the fate of the airliner -- one way or another. ""Now and then, every once in a while I call his phone and it goes to voicemail,"" she says. ""You never know, he might pick it up, or someone who has them would let them have the phone and you know, the hope is still there."" She's not alone. Families of victims we spoke to hold on to the slimmest belief that MH370, which disappeared barely an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 last year, did not crash and that the 239 passengers and crew on board are alive. ""No evidence means there is still a little bit of hope. We tap into that hope in order to go on day by day,"" says Gonzales. But she lives a life in limbo. Neither able to move on, nor go back. Her comfortable home in the suburbs of Malaysia's capital remains virtually the same since her husband of nearly 30 years, Patrick Gomes, left for work on the evening of March 7 as lead purser on the MH370 red-eye bound for the Chinese capital. The only real sign that time has moved on, amid the family photos and plaques celebrating her husband's work achievements is a newspaper on top of a stack in the living room with the word ""LOST"" splashed across its front page. Gonzales' lifeline, apart from family, is her work. She runs a private school and daycare center for about 70 children and spends about 12 hours a day there. Keeping busy, she says, keeps her sane. But not a day goes by without her thinking of Patrick. ""I can be driving and I just have to pull off the road and weep. Everywhere I go I see Patrick,"" she says. ""In our home, with my children, with our friends. There are so many times around the home when I say Patrick you are supposed to be doing this for me, where are you. He helped me with ironing, with cooking."" Like Gonzales, many other families CNN has spoken to say they live in hope that their loved one are still alive even though it seems now a virtual impossibility. But along with hope and the pain, many families also share a deep anger. Anger at the Malaysian authorities and Malaysia Airlines who, Gonzales says, are ignoring them. Requests for information are unanswered and attempts to talk to key officials are rebuffed, she says. Grace Nathan's mother was on MH370. For almost a year she and her family grieved in private. But now she has gone public

"Sepp Blatter celebrated his 79th birthday on Tuesday as one of his rivals for the FIFA presidency obtained some high-level support for his bid to be the most powerful person in world football. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has secured statements of support from the King of Bahrain and Prince Sufri Bolkiah, a senior member of the Brunei royal family. Although neither of the royals will have a vote at the election on May 29 there is a history, particularly in Arab countries, of the ruling family influencing football policy. FIFA Vice President Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is in the running to become the next president of FIFA . The Prince sits alongside UEFA President Michel Platini during a CONMEBOL congress on March 4 . That could be important to Prince Ali who has struggled to win support in his own Asian football confederation (AFC) - only one AFC country, his home country Jordan, nominated him to stand. It is by no means certain however that the Bahrain FA will back Prince Ali despite the King offering his support. AFC president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is also from Bahrain and has already given his backing to Blatter. Furthermore, the leading powerbroker in Olympic sport Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah from Kuwait is also supporting Blatter. Ali bin al-Hussein has received backing from high profile supporters, including the King of Bahrain (above), . Sheikh Ahmad wields significant influence, especially in Asia as head of the Olympic Council of Asia, and is himself standing for the FIFA executive committee at the end of April. Prince Ali is understood to be buoyed by the royal backing, and also to have taken heart from last week's congress of the South American confederation CONMEBOL, where no formal vote to back Blatter was taken. A report from Jordan's government new agency stated: 'His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalif of Bahrain, on Monday, received HRH Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein accompanied by Interior Minister Hussein Majali, and stressed Bahrain's support to Prince Ali's bid for FIFA presidency.' Blatter has three challengers for the presidency: Prince Ali, Dutch FA president Michael van Praag and former Portugal international Luis Figo. Despite being heavily criticised during his reign, Sepp Blatter wants the presidency for a fourth term . Luis Figo (left) and Michael van Praag are the two remaining candidates in the presidential race . Last week van Praag said there would be a better chance of victory if there was only one candidate from Europe. He also claimed Figo's plans for funding national associations would 'bankrupt FIFA'. Meanwhile, Germany's outgoing FIFA member Theo Zwanziger has reiterated his belief that the 2022 World Cup should be removed from Qatar if the Garcia report into bidding for the tournament flags up rule breaches. Zwanziger told Bayern 2 radio station: 'The best solution would be not to play in Qatar and to rectify this wrong decision. But that can only happen if the report provides sufficient clues that the awarding broke FIFA ethics rules.'

She revealed she will not be spending any of the prize money on herself, and hopes the check will be sent 'straight to her school' - where her 29-year-old daughter is also a teacher. After accepting the award, she thanked her colleagues and said: 'I love my teaching life - the intellectual, social, and personal challenges of working with young people and the satisfaction of developing methods that transform their lives and give them perspective on the lives of others. I am grateful to the Varkey Foundation for shining a light on teaching as a powerful profession, one of fulfillment, creativity, and lasting worth.' During an interview last week, Atwell said she's 'convinced that teaching language arts is one of the great careers', because it's 'demanding', but also 'meaning-filled' and 'interesting'. Atwell, 63, began teaching in 1973 . She said: 'I get to demonstrate what is possible, teach what is useful, establish conditions that invite engagement, support the hard work of literary reading and writing, and enjoy the kinds of relationships with adolescents that drew me to education in the first place. 'Because my students select the books they read and the subjects they write about, I'm able to help them discover what reading and writing are good for, here and now and in their literate lives to come. 'There is nothing more important than putting the right book in a child's hands at the right time.' Atwell founded the Center for Teaching and Learning in 1990, which uses experimental teaching methods on students in kindergarten through eighth grade. She built an 'excellent classroom library', in hopes of letting her own students discover what they wanted to read on their own. 'I worry that educational bureaucrats have a problem with pleasure,' she told USA Today, 'that if kids are enjoying what they're doing, it can't be rigorous or worthwhile.' The other American finalists Naomi Volain and and Stephen Ritz. Volain said when she heard about

"It was a good night for Premier League misfits at the NRGi Park as Denmark beat the USA thanks to a Nicklas Bendtner hat-trick after Jozy Altidore had opened the scoring for the visitors. On an evening when Tottenham's Christian Eriksen became the youngest Dane to win 50 international caps, Altidore, who could only muster a single goal in the English top flight during an 18-month spell at Sunderland, put the USA ahead after 19 minutes in Aarhus. But the Danes were soon level through former Arsenal forward Bendtner. Aron Johannsson restored Jurgen Klinsmann's side's lead before Bendtner scored twice in the final seven minutes to seal his hat-trick and earn victory for Morten Olsen's side. Nicklas Bendtner celebrates with his team-mates after firing the home side level during the first half .

The goal failed to alter the pattern of the game and the home side were level on 33 minutes. The Wolfsburg forward found himself in acres of space in the six yard box after the US defence failed to deal with Lasse Vibe's pass before Bendtner swept home. Johannsson gave the away side the lead - once more against the run of play - after 66 minutes when the AZ forward pounced in the box after Altidore's unselfish pass. As Denmark looked to be heading towards a home defeat Bedntner was on hand to grab his second to draw the hosts level for a second time in the 84th minute. And the game was won in injury time with the pick of the five goals. Eriksen played played a diagonal pass though to Bendtner who, with one touch brought the ball under control, before firing the ball into the bottom corner.

"(CNN)Tejano star Selena, who died 20 years ago, is coming back in a big way: with a hologram-like figure. Billboard reports that the singer's family is creating a version of the singer that will be ""walking, talking, singing and dancing digital embodiment"" of her persona. ""By no means is this something that's creepy or weird,"" her sister, Suzette Quintanilla, told Billboard. ""We think it's something amazing. A lot of the new fans that did not get to experience what Selena was about hopefully will be able to get a sense of her with this new technology that's going to be coming out."" Selena: 20 years after her death . The technology is being handled by Acrovirt LLC, a Nevada-based tech company. ""Using detailed individual personalized functions spanning the mind, brain and body, the individual's Digitized Human Essence will autonomously learn and react on behalf of its human counterpart's,"" the company explained. The project is being called ""Selena the One."" Twenty years after she was killed by her fan club president, Selena remains incredibly popular, with her Facebook page recording 2 million likes and fans continuing to post videos and tributes. Selena will be the first figure to use the Acrovirt technology, Quintanilla said. ""I'm excited at the fact that she will be the first ever, and the fact that she's a Latina makes it even more awesome,"" she said. ""It's not about replacing Selena in any shape, way or form; it's just something to help her legacy continue growing."" The family intends to expand her legacy in another way: with some new music. Selena the One ""will release new songs and videos, will collaborate with current hit artists, and aims to go on tour in 2018,"" said a statement on Selena's Facebook page. Selena isn't the first performer to try the virtual route. A Michael Jackson hologram appeared at the Billboard Music Awards in 2014, and a hologram of Tupac Shakur performed at Coachella in 2012. But the new technology is a step forward, Quintanilla said. ""People don't realize how fast technology is moving,"" she told Billboard. ""This is something that we're building for another two to three years, so when 2018 comes around they'll be like, 'Oh, OK, we get it.' "" Fans can join an Indiegogo campaign, www.selenatheone.com, to support the launch. The campaign, which hopes to raise $500,000, begins April 16. The commemorative Fiesta de la Flor in Corpus Christi, Texas -- which celebrates her life -- is scheduled for April 17 and 18. CNN's Katia Hetter contributed to this story.

Giani told an Italian police magazine when asked if threats from Islamic State militants were . credible. '(But) at the moment I can say that we are not aware of any . plan to attack the Vatican or the Holy Father,' he added in the . interview, published on the magazine's website on Monday. Giani has a force of some 130 agents protecting most of the Vatican and the Pope, with the help of the more ceremonial Swiss Guard. The Italian police guard the exterior, as well as St. Peter's Square. Twenty of his agents, Giani explained, have specialist anti-terror training and guard the Pope when he's abroad. He told Polizia Moderna: 'Twenty Vatican bodyguards have received special training that makes them suitable also ready to use in anti-terrorist actions. Some of them accompany the Pope during his international travels.' The security operation at the Vatican is aided by a command and control centre that Giani says has a 'high level' of technology, along with thousands of surveillance cameras.

They are also aware that some people may try and carry out an act of violence at the Vatican because it would guarantee them maximum media coverage. What makes their job more challenging is that the Holy Father is not willing to abandon speaking to his followers directly during visits.

"Steve Cotterill could be just a week away from putting Bristol City back into the Championship. The 50-year-old needs just two more wins to achieve the fourth promotion of a career that has been mostly spent rescuing clubs from relegation after goals by Kieran Agard, Joe Bryan and Aaron Wilbraham clinched a local derby victory. In front of a sold-out Ashton Gate, City took revenge for a bitterly fought 1-0 defeat back in November which ended their unbeaten start to the season. Bristol City's Aaron Wilbraham (left) tussles for the ball with Swindon Town's Yaser Kasim (right) Swindon Town's Michael Smith (left) shields the ball from the challenge of the oncoming Luke Ayling (right) Bristol City (4-4-2): Fielding, Ayling, Flint, Williams, Tavernier, Smith, Pack, Freeman (Wagstaff 93), Bryan, Agard (Emmanuel-Thomas 86), Wilbraham (Elliott 94) Subs not used: Saville, Richards, Cunningham, Osborne .

Booked: Turnbull, Kasim . Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire) Attendance: 12,302 . That finished with Swindon chairman Lee Power accusing Cotterill of 'lacking class'. But it was the City boss who had the last laugh with a victory that left Swindon boss Mark Cooper having to pick his side up from two 3-0 defeats in four days that have finished their last hope of automatic promotion. Just to add to their woes they had both Yaser Kasim and Raphael Branco booked, meaning both will now serve suspensions. City had actually needed to ride their luck for much of the first half, with goalkeeper Frank Fielding pulling off three saves in two frantic minutes at one point. And Swindon striker Andy Williams cost Cooper's side their best chance of going in front when he cashed in on a mistake by Aden Flint to go through. He should have squared the ball back to strike partner Michael Smith who couldn' t have missed but instead tried to go it alone and gave Fielding the chance to save. Bristol City striker Kieran Agard (centre) celebrates giving his side the 1-0 lead against Swindon Town . Ben Gladwin (left) brings the ball for Swindon as Bristol City's Joe Bryan (centre) gives chace in midfield . As if that miss wasn't frustrating enough for the visitors, they were then architects of their own downfall when City took the lead on 35 minutes. Yaser Kasim was put under pressure as Swindon tried to play the ball out from the back from a goal kick, and gave it away to Joe Bryan. The young wing back hit a perfect pass to send Agard clear to make no mistake with his 11th goal of the season. City had earned that goal for the way they worked to put pressure on defenders, and they made their own luck again when Derrick Williams stretched to divert Ben Gladwin's shot onto the underside of the bar.

"Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon has died following a long and difficult battle with colon cancer. The 59-year-old had initially been diagnosed with the terminal illness in 2012 when he was given just three months to live. A big animal rights advocate, Simon had previously announced that he would donate his $100 million fortune to his charity once he passed.

Creators of The Simpsons Matt Groening, James Brooks, and Sam Simon, right, are interviewed about the hit show in the early 1990s . 'For those of us who knew him, his voice will forever echo in our minds; his sense of humor will continue to make us laugh; and his compassion and generosity will continue to impact our lives,' The Sam Simon Foundation said in a statement issued to TMZ. 'Sam, you will be missed by many, but there is a particular sadness among our clinic staff. We have been together for so long, and your absence will forever leave a void in our lives.' 'A great man; I owe him everything,' tweeted The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean, adding that his passing was 'an enormous loss.' Simon was last interviewed in November when he described his illness as the 'most amazing experience of my life', because he was surrounded by his loved ones. After his diagnosis in 2012, Simon immediately teamed up with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) president Ingrid Newkirk, and dedicate his time to the rescue of maltreated animals and conservation. Having defied that diagnosis' original death sentence, Simon then pushed ahead and has funded projects such as 'Feeding Families' to help with the underprivileged in inner cities.

I have never been happier, so thank you doctor.' However, Simon did not shrink from the realities of his condition, nor fail to inject some trademark humor. 'Cancer is a horrible disease,' he said.

"It's every interviewer's worst nightmare. Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence. Which is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past. After questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life . In the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room. The American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' The horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat . But Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning. Naomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives.

"England head coach Peter Moores, who should surely be sacked after the World Cup humiliation against Bangladesh, is doubly fortunate at the timing of this rock-bottom moment for English cricket. Firstly, the new regime at the England Cricket Board are concentrating on a big restructuring of the organisation, to the extent that axing the beleaguered Moores was said not to be even on the agenda — or wasn’t last week. Secondly, Aussie Jason Gillespie, who would be hot favourite to replace Moores, is not sure he wants the role. Gillespie has five children — with four under the age of 10 — and the county championship-winning Yorkshire coach has promised wife Anna he will put the family first. England coach Peter Moores (left) said he is 'desperate' to continue after his side's poor World Cup campaign . Gillespie said: ‘My eldest daughter Sapphire lives at home in Australia with her mum and I didn’t see her grow up as I was on the road playing for Australia. I made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t do the same again. The children are my priority, family come first.’ And Gillespie, who worked very successfully with England number two Paul Farbrace at a Yorkshire bankrolled by new ECB chairman Colin Graves, added: ‘It would be a really big ask to go away 9-10 months a year. I would find that really difficult. I’d find that a challenge.’ Phil Neville (left, with Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino) will work on his FA Pro-license this week . Phil Neville and Brentford manager Mark Warburton are part of a select group of 24 coaches working on their FA Pro-Licence at St George’s Park this week - at a time when the FA of Wales are promoting their ‘world class’ alternative course which has Thierry Henry, Les Ferdinand and Tim Sherwood signed up. However, the FA still regard their coaching badges as the gold standard and will react to the Welsh competition by putting on two Pro-licence courses a year in future rather than one. But there will be no reduction in the extra hours involved in completing the SGP course — 500 as compared to 350 in Wales — that the FA believe gives their set-up the edge.

"A jealous son reversed his Mazda over his own father because he was convinced he had slept with his ex-girlfriend, a court heard. Dean Wilson, 37, accused his father of sleeping with his former partner and then warned: 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'. Norman Wilson initially laughed because his son's disturbing promise reminded him of Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous line from the film The Terminator. Now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is so terrified he is planning to move away, the court heard. Dean Wilson (left), 37, was jailed after running over his father Norman (right) with his Mazda because he was convinced he had slept with his ex-girlfriend, a court heard . Speaking from his home today, Mr Wilson said he is living in fear since his son went to jail. He said: 'I am traumatised by what happened. I need to move away. Everytime I look out of my front window onto where it happened I have a flashback.' 'I can remember feeling my ribs crack one by one as he reversed over me. 'Then he put one foot on the accelerator and one on the break to spin the wheel round to rip my skin off my legs. 'It was excruciating.' He added he has no clue where the idea that he had had an affair with Dean Wilson's ex-partner came from, insisting 'it never happened'. Norman, a retired recycling worker, said his son had three children with Elizabeth Marshall but that he only saw his grandchildren in passing in the street. 'He's not even with her anymore, I heard he was seeing someone else. Dean was accusing me of having an affair with her five years ago,' he added. The 60-year-old added he would never be rebuilding his relationship with his son, and felt he was constantly on the lookout for fear he would send someone to hurt him. 'I can't sleep at night or concentrate; I'm always looking over my shoulder. I don't know who his mates are. If my son says he'll be back, he'll be back. 'I've got to get away and move on with my life.' The defendant, who the court heard has a record of anxiety and depression, was arrested after going to Chesterfield Royal Hospital's mental health unit and admitting running over his father. Norman Wilson was treated for broken ribs, bruising (pictured) and grazes after he was run over by his son . He later told police he was certain his father had slept with his ex-girlfriend and that he drove over him twice because he was angry - but he denied trying to kill his father. Dean Wilson was charged with attempted murder, before the charge was dropped and changed to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which he admitted in court. He was jailed for six years at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday. Prosecuting the case, Dawn Pritchard, said: 'The windscreen of Norman Wilson's Ford Focus had been smashed and he was out vacuuming the car when he heard a screech. 'He turned and saw his

"George Osborne dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country's top earners . Labour and Tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the Chancellor's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the Government's priorities. George Osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country's top earners, offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than £50,000 could see the rate lowered. Instead he says the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax-free personal allowance bracket from £10,000 to £12,500. Raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least £50,000 was also a priority, he said. At present anyone earning between £31,866 to £150,000 is taxed at the higher rate. Those earning above £150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent. But Labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket. Accusing the current Government of prioritising 'helping the very richest', Shadow chief secretary Chris Leslie condemned the Chancellor's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries. When pressed in an interview with Sky News the Chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for Britain's top earners, instead saying the issue was 'not a priority'. 'If that was our priority or our plan we would have made it part of our plan and made it one of our priorities. Scroll down for video . 'That's not our plan. Judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions are better off,' he said. 'And when it comes to higher rate taxpayers our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate, the 40p rate, to £50,000.' 'Those are our big tax commitments for the coming parliament.' The Chancellor added that any deal between Labour and SNP would harm the country, claiming the latter's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was 'much stronger' than the opposition leader . He also refused to commit to devoting 2 per cent of the budget to defence, the limit agreed by NATO members. David Cameron has faced repeated calls to commit to spending 2 per cent of the budget on defence . 'We made a commitment at Nato. We are spending it today. We have made a clear commitment to the future of the equipment budget, to increase that in real terms ..,. and we have made commitments on the size of the armed forces,' he said. 'I don't think anyone should be in any doubt ... about our commitment to strong national security'. He also said any deal struck between the SNP and Labour would harm the country, lambasting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to broker such a partnership as 'disturbing'. 'The fact that the Labour Party, that was a party that campaigned for the Union in the referendum,

"Cape Verde's 2-0 win over Portugal was the most eye-catching international result of the week. So, who are Cape Verde and why has this tiny island off the west coast of Africa suddenly become an international football force? Where are the Cape Verde Islands? Cape Verde is a group of islands 400 miles from Senegal off the west coast of Africa. Its population is around 500,000 and boasts both beautiful beaches and striking volcanic landscapes, making it a haven for tourism . Cape Verde is a picturesque island off the African coast with a population of just 500,000 people . Does it have any footballing tradition? More than you think. Manchester United winger Nani is from Cape Verde and could have played for them instead of Portugal. Celtic and Sweden legend Henrik Larsson's mum is from Cape Verde. Being a former Portuguese colony, most people support the big Lisbon clubs Benfica and Sporting, you see the club's scarves and banners hanging from cafes and bars . Sporting Lisbon ace Nani (centre) is from Cape Verde but decided to represent Portugal at national team level . Former Barcelona star Henrik Larsson could have played for Cape Verde as his mother was born on the island . Why the sudden success? Like a lot of African countries including Algeria and Ghana, Cape Verde decided to start recruiting players who grew up in Europe, mostly Portugal in their case, but were eligible for them through family ties. Around a quarter of the Cape Verde squad are European, although 14 of the 19 players used in Portugal were born on the island. They qualified for their first Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and reached the quarter-finals, and qualified again this year. They are the smallest nation ever to play in the continental finals. Cape Verde were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of their first ever Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 . Who are the star players? Every member of the squad plays club football outside Cape Verde, mostly in Europe and particularly Portugal. Striker Heldon plays for Sporting Lisbon and midfield set-piece specialist Babanco is with Estoril. Odair Fortes, who scored their second goal against the Portuguese, plays in French football for Reims. Other members of the squad ply their trade from Romania, Angola, Cyprus, Hungary, Holland, Bulgaria and Mexico . Sporting Lisbon striker Heldon, currently on loan at Cordoba, is one of Cape Verde's key players . What can Cape Verde offer visitors? Firstly, sunshine. The temperatures rarely dip below 21 degrees Celsius (70 F) even in the December and January winger months. The name of the main beach Boa Vista (beautiful view) says it all. It is beginning to become a big tourist destination, just a six-hour flight from the UK. Visitors are encouraged to sample the excellent local fish and admire the spectacular dunes and volcanic mountains. Boa Vista beach, pictured, is one of the main attractions on the small island of Cape Verde . Are they a flash-in-the-pan? The FIFA rankings would suggest not. Cape Verde currently stand 38th in

"(CNN)Richard Dysart, the award-winning stage actor who gained fame playing law firm leader Leland McKenzie on ""L.A. Law,"" has died. He was 86. He died of cancer at his home in Santa Monica, California, according to his wife, Kathryn Jacobi Dysart. For decades, Dysart was a noted TV and film character actor, and stage star, winning a Drama Desk award for playing coach in Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, ""That Championship Season."" But it was as McKenzie, the occasionally crusty paterfamilias on ""L.A. Law,"" that he's likely best remembered. 'L.A. Law': Sex, crime and the 'Venus Butterfly' McKenzie usually took a back seat to the younger, more glamorous characters on ""Law,"" a Steven Bochco-created legal show that owed much to his previous hit, ""Hill Street Blues."" The employees of McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak included Harry Hamlin's smooth-talking Michael Kuzak, Corbin Bernsen's skirt-chasing divorce attorney Arnie Becker and Michele Greene's idealistic Abby Perkins. There was as much time devoted to bedroom activities as there was legal issues while the show bravely took on such topics as AIDS, child molestation and capital punishment. But McKenzie was the one who kept them in check while still encouraging their better instincts. (Alan Rachins' Douglas Brackman was the business guy.) He was also involved in one of the show's most surprising plot twists: a romantic affair with a rival, Rosalind Shays (Diana Muldaur), who met with one of TV's most shocking deaths -- plunging down an elevator shaft. Dysart appeared in every episode of the show, which ran from 1986 to 1994. After ""L.A. Law"" ended, Dysart took few roles, though he did return for an ""L.A. Law"" reunion movie in 2002. Dysart's other credits include 1971's ""The Hospital,"" 1975's ""The Day of the Locust,"" 1979's ""Being There,"" John Carpenter's 1982 version of ""The Thing,"" 1985's ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" and 1987's ""Mask."" He is survived by Jacobi Dysart, his wife of nearly three decades, a son and two grandchildren. CNN's Rachel Wells contributed to this story.

"(CNN)There can be no March without the madness. When it comes to college basketball, the first month of spring ushers in a frantic slew of games to determine seedings for one of the most fervently watched sporting events in the U.S., known simply as the NCAA Tournament, or more often, March Madness. Like English soccer's FA Cup, much of the 68-team tournament's appeal is its egalitarian system of pitting traditional powerhouse programs like Duke, UCLA and Kentucky against relative minnows like Saint Mary's, Butler and Davidson. And both competitions offer the carrot of being able to impress scouts from top pro teams -- a first-round NBA pick can expect to earn anywhere from $755,000 to $5.75 million. Not bad for a graduate. Last year's tournament reached 102 million viewers, while almost 740,000 fans attended the 36 sessions. ""When you go to college, maybe your number one goal before you graduate is you want to be able to play in the NCAA tournament,"" says Bryce Drew, head coach and former player at Valparaiso University in Indiana (28-5, Horizon League champions). ""It's the biggest stage for college basketball, and it's one of the biggest national events in all of America."" Drew knows just how big an impact that high-profile stage can have on aspiring professionals from beyond the major college ranks. His last-second shot for Valparaiso to beat the University of Mississippi in the first round of the 1998 tournament is one of the most replayed moments in March Madness history. How it works: . Selection Sunday (March 15) A 10-member panel determines seedings for the 68 teams that make the knockout tournament . First Four (March 17-18) A format started in 2011, 8 teams compete to qualify in the main draw . Second round (March 19-20) 64 teams split into 4 regions: Midwest, West, South and East . #1 plays #16 in each group . Third round (March 21-22) Down to 32 teams . Regional semifinals (March 26-27) Known as the ""Sweet Sixteen"" Regional finals (March 28-29) The ""Elite Eight"" National semifinals (April 4) The ""Final Four"" is played at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis; minimum capacity 70,000 . Championship Game (April 6) One of the most-watched events in U.S. sport . ""I had always dreamed of winning the game in the NCAA tournament (and) always dreamed of making the last-second shot. For God to bless (me) with both of things at one time is something that I'll always cherish and remember,"" Drew says. His father, Homer Drew, was Valparaiso's coach at the time, and his brother Scott (now men's basketball coach at Baylor University) was an assistant, completing the Hollywood scenario. ""I don't think any of us realized that they would show that replay the next year, and even the next year, and the next year. We were just so happy in the moment and never thought that we'd be able to talk about it over a decade later,"" he says. Showing the highlight is virtually a prerequisite whenever Drew coaches a nationally televised game, and is sure to come up next

"A magistrate has refused to ban the media from naming the former head of child safety at Education Queensland who has been charged with child sex offences. The 52-year-old has been free on bail since March, when he was charged with sexually and indecently assaulting two 12-year-old boys at schools in Sydney more than 25 years ago.

"A newly released video shows the shocking moment a Boston police officer was shot in the face just seconds after approaching a driver who was stopped during a gunfire investigation. The video shows how Angelo West, 41, immediately jumps out of the car and shoots Officer John Moynihan, 34, under the eye at close range after the policeman opens the driver-side door. West then fires at the other officers as he runs across the busy street. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans pointed out that he was firing 'under his arm' at the other cops. The video shows Boston police officer John Moynihan, circled in white, opening the driver-side door to talk to Angelo West after the car was pulled over during a gunfire investigation . West then immediately jumps out of the car and shoots Moynihan in the face at close range . Officer Moynihan , 34, was released from the hospital Friday after weeks of recovery. The Boston Police Department described his current condition as 'serious but improving' The video, captured from the surveillance camera of a nearby store, shows the beginning of the shootout that led to officers firing the fatal shots that killed West. 'This particular incident we had no other choice,' Evans said about the fatal shooting. 'He had already used deadly force, trying to kill one of my officers, and the officers did what they were trained to do.' During a press conference, Evans said the video shows that the officers did not have their weapons drawn or have their hands their hands on their weapons when they approached West's car. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said it was important to release the video to show the community exactly what happened - and why. 'In those instances in which video evidence can inform the public... it is in everyone's best interest to share that information as soon as possible,' Conley said during the press conference. The district attorney said such transparency was necessary to 'tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not to inform'. 'Our goal going forward is to ensure that we are one people and one city,' he said. Evans said Moynihan had seen the video. Angelo West was fatally shot by Moynihan's colleagues during the shoot-out.

But Evans said 'there are no winners here'. 'We have an officer who was seriously injured, and we have a family who is grieving the loss of a loved one,' he said.

"Tiger Woods was genial. Tiger Woods was charm personified. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world. You can grin your way through life as the 111th best golfer in the world. No pressure. No big whoop. Judging by some of the stuff said and written about Woods in the build-up to his 20th Masters, it will be an achievement if he makes the cut. Very respected names have close to begged him not to compete. Woods doesn’t see it like that at all. He’s in it to win it. And it’s in those little moments that the old Tiger — some would argue the real Tiger — breaks cover again. Tiger Woods was all smiles as he played a practice around ahead of his 20th appearance at the Masters . The former best player in the world arrives at Augusta ranked a lowly 111th in the game . Woods name appears on the Masters' tournament winner's board four times; 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005 . It was all smiles and wise-cracks as Woods sat before the assembled press on Tuesday. Questions that would once have been greeted with terse disregard were warmly expanded upon. Memory lane was tripped down, the elder statesman played. He even referred to some of the correspondents in the room as his friends. And then he was asked where a win this week, from one ranking place lower than Tomohiro Kondo of Japan, at a point in his career when it was wondered whether he would be seen on the golf course as a competing professional again, would rank in his career achievements. And up leapt old Tiger. He didn’t answer this one with a short, evocative speech or a ready quip. He shut it down, old school. One sentence, no messing, no prospect of elaboration. Woods has insisted that he would not enter a tournament unless he thought he had a chance of winning it . The 39-year-old looks towards the ground after hitting a shot during practice on Monday . Woods smiles as he talks with his traditional practice partner Mark O'Meara (left) at Augusta . ‘It would be my 15th major,’ said Woods. The temperature in the room dropped by several degrees. Brevity replaced levity. The questioner, gamely, tried again with a slight rephrase. ‘Long way to go before that,’ Woods replied. ‘Lot of work to do.’ He smiled. The chill passed. And, of course, that is exactly what it would be. Just his 15th major, if it signalled a true return to form. And on to the next one. World No 4 Jordan Spieth was in ninth grade — 14 years old — when Woods won his last major in 2008. But if he could win a fifth Masters he would be back in the game. And no more Mr Nice Guy, one feels. From 111th in the world, Woods has time to take the scenic route in conversation. Back to where he was, back to contending, he would be all business again.

"Scottish drinkers are so cautious of the country's new drink-driving limits bar sales have plummeted by 60 per cent - a reduction in spending so severe it's damaging the country's financial growth. Under the new Scottish drink-drive law, enacted on December 5, the limit was cut from 80mg per 100ml of blood to just 50mg. And the effect of the drop in sales is so severe, it is being blamed for a poor result in the country's latest Bank of Scotland PMI report. Scotland's tough new drink driving law is being blamed for stalling the country's financial growth . Donald MacRae, chief economist at Bank of Scotland, said: 'Manufacturing exporters have been affected by the falling euro while services businesses in hospitality are seeing a changing pattern of spending resulting from the lowered alcohol limit while driving.' The report follows a February study which revealed the country's bar sales had dropped by 60 per cent when the new limit was introduced. Publicans are now concerned the new laws will have a greater effect on bars and drinking establishments than the 2006 smoking ban. Paul Waterson, chief executive of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, told The Independent the new law - which matches limits across much of Continental Europe - was a 'form of prohibition'. He said: 'It’s stopped people having a drink at lunchtime, or having a drink on the way home from work. People aren’t coming in for food with their families on a Sunday afternoon. Hospitality industry leaders claim the new law is stopping moderate drinkers from having a tipple at lunch or on their way home from work . 'We feel it’s had an effect far worse than the smoking ban had in 2006. There’s questions being asked about the future of the trade – it’s probably the last nail in the coffin for independent operators.' The February study, carried out by purchasing firm Beacon, revealed there was a surge in interest in non-alcoholic drinks and smaller glass sizes. Tennant Hilditch, director of sales, said the first two months of the new drink driving laws had shown a 'real impact' on the country's hospitality industry. He said: 'Traditional lunchtime drinkers, or post-golf drinkers in the clubhouse have been particularly affected by the new rules. 'So much so, that we are seeing demand for smaller glasses, weaker beers, a trend towards introducing earlier lunch sittings so guests or golfers can stay longer and do not return to the roads as quickly, as well as an increased interest in ""mocktails"".' In the wake of the law change, Police Scotland assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins encouraged drinkers to 'leave the car at home' if they were planning to go for a drink. He said: 'There is no safe amount of alcohol in the body if you drive. It is clear when it comes to drinking and driving, that the simple ""the best advice is none"" message is the right one.' While the limit brings Scotland in line with the rest of Europe, it is significantly lower than that of England and Wales

"When Nic Newling recalls his childhood, he remembers misleading highs and deep depressions where the only option he could see for himself was committing suicide. But it was the unexpected and tragic death of his teenage brother, Christopher, who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Now, the 28-year-old is using his story of loss and confusion - in which he moved between doctors and psychiatric wards and was fed various concoctions of prescriptive medication before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - to raise awareness of mental illness. Mental health advocate Nic Newling struggled through the confusing highs and depressing lows of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder between the ages of 13 and 18 . It was the unexpected and tragic death of his older, teenage brother Christopher (pictured right with Nic left), who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective . Academically driven from a young age, Nic said that the time he was eight years old, he had planned his whole life out in his mind with the intention of becoming a vet. 'I got into a high school with a scholarship; at that point I was really happy for the first six months, but I pushed myself too hard and put an unrealistic amount of pressure on myself and just crashed. What it looked like was not having any other interests, being snappy and grumpy and angry - which are all things that are not like me at all,' he told Daily Mail Australia. His bad moods progressed into forms of anxiety and depression and what Nic described as an 'overwhelming sadness that didn't come from any particular place', before taking on a level of psychosis. 'When things first started getting bad, I was experiencing symptoms of agitation, panic attacks, I was withdrawing from friends and life and not finding pleasure in the things that I used to find pleasurable, I was experiencing what I thought was OCD behaviors and I started thinking I was hearing things that weren't real,' he said. Both Nic (left) and Christopher (centre, with eldest brother Ben right) suffered from mental health problems at the same time . Unlike Nic (left), Christopher (with Ben right) was not as open about his emotions and his anxiety and depression. His death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on Nic's struggles . 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. 'I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room.' By year eight, Nic had admitted himself into a psychiatric ward - a move that marked the beginning of years of confusions and various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy - in a desperate bid to rid himself

"Dr Mehmet Oz's fellow faculty members at Columbia have written an op-ed lashing out at how his 'unsubstantiated medicine... sullies the reputation' of the university - in just the latest attack on his talk show tactics. But they also leap to the physician's defense in the piece, saying that his on-air 'Ozisms' should not cancel out his stellar work at the university, where he has an unblemished record as a doctor. The eight staff wrote the op-ed for USA Today after 10 doctors urged Columbia to sever all ties with Oz, who serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at the College of Physicians. Those doctors accused him of being a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments' on his syndicated talk show - accusations Dr Oz has vehemently fought this week. Scroll down for videos . Under fire: Faculty at Columbia University have said some of Dr Mehmet Oz's tactics have 'sullied their reputation' - but also applauded him for the work he had carried out at the Ivy League school . In the new op-ed, his fellow faculty also denounced his TV show methods. They pointed out that in 2014, the BMJ medical journal said 'that less than half of the recommendations on his show are based on at least somewhat believable evidence'. 'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers,' the staff members wrote in the op-ed. 'Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.' That said, 'the weaknesses in [his] professional balance sheet' should not force him out of his job at Columbia University, where he has been employed since 2001, they wrote. He was hired because of his strengths as a doctor and receives top reviews from his peers and patients, and therefore should not be forced to leave the job 'in which he excels', they wrote. Support: The eight faculty members, including Drs Michael Rosenbaum, left, and Joan Bregstein. right, said they have spent a great deal of their time debunking 'Ozisms' their colleague had shared on air . Instead, they suggested that his case raises questions of what responsibilities doctors in the media have to their patients. 'What happens when a doctor's job in media-medicine collides with office- or hospital-based medicine? Dr. Mehmet Oz is a case in-point.' 'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers. Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.' 'We need to re-evaluate the roles of the health sciences and government in broadcast medicine and what are the responsibilities of media physicians to their patients?' 'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful. However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in

"The leader of France's far-right has been named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people alongside President Barack Obama, Pope Francis and Kanye West. National Front leader Marine Le Pen, 46, who took over from her father in 2011, says it shows that her party's brand of political change is getting attention on both sides of the Atlantic. In an interview before a dinner in honour of the Time 100 ion New York on Tuesday, the leader of the staunchly anti-immigration Front spoke of representing a 'great political force'. Anti-immigrant honoured: The leader of right-wing National Front, Marine Le Pen, 46, said being one of the Time 100, shows that her party's brand of political change is getting attention on both sides of the Atlantic . 'People are taking note of the political upheavals that are happening, a great political force that I represent tonight - and that tomorrow can perhaps change the face of decisions that are made not just in France, but perhaps in Europe,' Le Pen said. The recognition comes at an eventful time for Le Pen, who recently announced she would oppose her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, on his candidacy in France's regional elections in December. Earlier this month, Le Pen Snr, who founded National Front in 1972, infuriated his daughter with a series of racist and anti-Semitic remarks. The 86-year-old had repeated his claim that the Holocaust was ‘a detail of history’ and had also praised France’s wartime leader Marshal Petain, who collaborated with Hitler. This angered Marine, who said she would not back him in the elections and accused him of ‘political suicide’. Far-right views: Before The Time 100 gala in New York, the leader of the staunchly anti-immigration Front spoke of representing a 'great political force' in Europe . Family feud: Marine, who took over leadership of the party from her father Jean-Marie, 86, in 2011 recently accused him of 'political suicide' after he repeated his claim that the Holocaust was ‘a detail of history’ After this, Jean-Marie Le Pen told French publication Le Figaro that he was withdrawing his candidacy in the south-east Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur region ‘even though I think I am the best candidate’. The former paratrooper said it was because the party was at risk of being ‘dangerously weakened’ over what he called a severe but unjustified crisis over his comments. Mr Le Pen, who remains the Front’s honorary president, said the best replacement candidate would be his grand-daughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, who confirmed shortly after that she would seek the party’s nomination. Marine Le Pen declined Tuesday to discuss what she thought would be an appropriate punishment but said the party 'can no longer be the hostage of views that are personal views and that certainly contradict the political action of the National Front.' Influential: Rapper Kanye West and his wife, reality TV star Kim Kardashian-West are both on the list . Proud: Mia Farrow and her son Ronan Farrow both attended the Time 100 Gala, in New York last night . Celebrated: Actors Bradley Cooper and Emma Watson

"THE WILD OATS PROJECT . by Robin Rinaldi . (Hodder £14.99) At the age of 42, San Francisco-based journalist Robin Rinaldi believed she had accidentally succeeded in conceiving a longed- for child. The pregnancy test turned out to be wrong, but her husband Scott wasn’t taking any more chances: he got a vasectomy. Rinaldi’s response was to demand an open marriage and bed 12 strangers in as many months. She’s now written a graphic, tell-all memoir about that year and its very messy fallout. Robin Rinaldi (pictured) demanded an open marriage from her husband, Scott after he had a vasectomy . When they met, 17 years earlier, Rinaldi wasn’t sure she wanted kids. As her biological clock began ticking louder, though, a child came to embody the solution to all sorts of problems. It would strengthen their marriage of opposites, help her finally overcome a troubled childhood as the daughter of an alcoholic bookie and give her life a sense of purpose. Her husband, meanwhile, was adamantly against it from the start. For reasons she never quite gets to the bottom of, he has no desire ever to become a father. She depicts him as stable and stoic but, frankly, he sounds a bit of a cold fish, spending much of his spare time making mead, keeping a file on his laptop entitled My World View and refusing to look her in the eye during sex. After his vasectomy, Rinaldi’s discontent settles onto her failure to sleep around when she was single. ‘I refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers,’ she declares. ‘If I can’t have one, I must have the other.’ Promiscuity, she’s certain, will enable her to look back from her deathbed and feel she’s lived. Instead of ending her marriage, she strikes a bargain that seems to give her the best of both worlds. During the week, Rinaldi lives in a rented studio, free to have as much casual sex as she likes. She picks up men on business trips, places ‘good girl seeks experience’ ads online and, eventually, gravitates to an urban sex commune, where very hands-on orgasmic meditation is practised twice daily. Come the weekend, she returns to Scott and their cat Cleo — no questions asked. Reading about her Wild Oats Project, it’s hard to know what’s more astonishing — that Scott ever agreed to this 5:2 open marriage or that Rinaldi thought it could possibly solve anything. Full disclosure: some years ago, I published a memoir about my own year-long experiment — with chastity. Afterwards, several people told me I should write a follow-up in which I did the exact opposite. I assumed they were joking, but that’s more or less precisely what Rinaldi has done. Not that it isn’t titillating stuff — at least to begin with. What she craves most especially is dirty talk, and she gives as good as she gets. There’s no hint of coyness as she details every sexual act she participates in along the way. As it gets steamier, her prose flushes a

That footage was seen by the owner of the repair shop where Nguyen works, who quickly passed on the news. 'The owner mentioned it to him and he thought that the owner was joking around with him,' a translator for Nguyen told ABC 7. Nguyen then tried to come forward even though he did not have the ticket, but the winnings ultimately went to the California public school system. The other big winner, the Rosemead Supermarket that sold the ticket, was still able to collect their $5,493 bonus. As for unclaimed winnings, it happens more than people might think, with $20million going unclaimed during the last fiscal year in California alone.

"Garnet has been abandoned for almost 100 years. The tiny Montana outpost was established in the 1860s by miners looking for gold and silver, but it was devastated by fire around 1912 and deserted a few years later. While the town has since been restored, it remains empty, and local folklore says the area is haunted by former residents, with visitors saying they heard music and laughter, even in winter, and the sound of doors slamming in cottages where there aren't any doors.

"An Indonesian minister has threatened to release a 'human tsunami' of asylum seekers towards Australia if the Federal Government continues to fight for a stay of execution for the Bali Nine duo. The warning came from the coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs -Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno - to remind the government who was working to keep asylum seekers away from Australian shores, Fairfax Media reported. It comes after Indonesian government officials took offence to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments about Australia donating $1 billion in aid to help recovery after the Boxing Day tsunami along with threatening to discourage visitors to Bali. Scroll down for video . The Bali Nine duo are spending their seventh night in semi-isolation at Nusakambangan in Central Java . Mr Tedjo, who is a former navy chief, said his government had been played a big part in stopping asylum seekers from making their way to Australia during a speech made at a Yogyakarta university broadcast on Metro TV. 'If Canberra keeps doing things that displease Indonesia, Jakarta will surely let the illegal immigrants go to Australia,' he said. 'There are more than 10,000 [asylum seekers] in Indonesia today. If they are let go to Australia, it will be like a human tsunami.' Mr Tedjo - who is an outspoken politician in Indonesia - added it was 'no big deal' if trade relations with Australia fell apart following the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman. Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno (pictured left with president Joko Widodo) is the coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs in Indonesia . It comes after Indonesian government officials took offence to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments about Australia donating $1 billion in aid to help recovery after the Boxing Day tsunami . He said Australia was the nation that benefited most from the agreement, not Indonesia. 'Australia will in fact receive pressure domestically if it stops its livestock exports to Indonesia since Indonesia is Australia's main market,' Mr Tedjo said. The minister also labelled Julie Bishop's earlier request to spare Chan and Sukuraman in exchange for three Indonesia drug smugglers held in Australia as 'unethical'. He said Australia needed to respect the laws of Indonesia. The pair are being held inside Besi jail in separate cells to each other as they await execution . This comes as the Bali Nine pair spent their seventh night at Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island' - as they await the outcomes of appeals made by other prisoners who are scheduled to be executed alongside them. Chan and Sukuraman were sentenced to death after they were caught trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms from Indonesia to Australia. They have spent the last 10 years inside Kerobokan prison in Bali. Chan converted to Christianity and became a pastor while behind bars. At the same time, Sukuraman trained as an artist, even teaching other inmates how to paint.

"Sporting America fell in love with him because of his skill under pressure and his sheer bravura. The rest of America fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed. The 79th Masters attracted massive ratings in the USA and there is no surprise in that. They tuned in to watch as perfect a demonstration of sporting endeavour as you will ever behold. But they also tuned in to watch a man with a common touch and a depth of sincerity that reached into the heart of every household. Politicians who try so hard to be popular could learn much from 21-year-old Masters champion Jordan Spieth. The green jackets and dignitaries sitting behind him were enraptured as the winner gave an unscripted speech so gracious and natural you would think that public speaking was his calling rather than the Royal and Ancient game. Jordan Spieth wears his new green jacket after winning the Masters at Augusta on Sunday . Spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at Augusta National . Spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. And then he remembered his father’s words: ‘Make sure you say thank you to the people, son.’ So he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. With this victory, Spieth must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner. You will not find a single pro on the PGA Tour with a bad word to say about him. There is nothing fake about Jordan Spieth. Texans are supposed to be brash and larger than life, right? This one makes jokes about his receding hairline and dislikes being asked why he comes across as humble because, well, that would not be humble. Listen to Phil Mickelson, the Masters specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at Augusta only once before. ‘He’s just a class guy in every way and it’s difficult not to root for him,’ said the leftie. Spieth watches his tee shot on the seventh hole during the final round . Spieth gives a fistpump after making a birdie putt on the third green on the final day . ‘This is a momentous week in the history of our game. Along with Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth is going to carry it for the next decade and what an exciting time it promises to be.’ Sir Nick Faldo, on American television, sums up perfectly the feelings of a sport at the end of truly epochal week. Listen to Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: ‘Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. Jordan is so beyond his years. I

"A police corruption trial in Philadelphia is far from over, but already one trial witness has been handed a losing verdict. Witness Robert Kushner lost his varsity coaching job at a private academy after testifying this week about his years selling marijuana. Kushner, 32, is one of more than a dozen former drug dealers testifying for the federal government about allegations of police wrongdoing. Witness Robert Kushner lost his varsity coaching job at the Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy after testifying this week about his years selling marijuana . He told jurors Tuesday that some of the undercover officers on trial had stolen $81,000 in cash and 7 pounds of marijuana from him during a 2007 arrest. That history came as news to officials at Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy in suburban Bryn Mawr. Kushner had passed a background check when he was hired to coach basketball in 2010, head of school Sharon Levin told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Kushner testified that the 2007 charges were expunged as part of a probationary sentence. On cross-examination, he acknowledged that he was arrested again in 2011 and sentenced to four years of probation. He also pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in 2008. This undated photo combination provided by the Philadelphia Police Department shows from top left to right, Philadelphia Police officers Thomas Liciardello, Brian Reynolds, Michael Spicer, and from bottom left to right, Perry Betts, Linwood Norman and John Speiser, all of whom were arrested and charged in the 26-count indictment include racketeering conspiracy, extortion, robbery, kidnapping and drug dealing . Kushner told the newspaper that he never meant to deceive the school, where he worked as a seasonal employee. And he believes he is innocent of the 2011 charges. 'All of the stuff that happened in 2007, that was eight years ago and was a bad phase of my life that I've moved past and never really looked back,' Kushner said Wednesday. ""I'm very sorry, and I want the best for the kids."" He also coaches in a Narberth summer league, where director Dan Kazanicka described him as an excellent coach who is good with kids. Lawyers for the six former drug squad officers accused of racketeering have said the government case is based on 19 lying drug dealers and a rogue ex-cop.

"A young mother choked to death on her vomit after eating a Kinder Beuno while drowsy on painkillers, an inquest has heard. Candice Campbell, 25, who had taken the medicine to help her post-natal stomach pain, drifted off to sleep while eating the chocolate bar. Miss Campbell, mother to one-year-old son Harrison, then choked as she was sleeping beside her fiancé on the couple's sofa in Hull. Doting: Mother-of-one Candice Campbell, 25 (pictured left and right with partner Geoffrey Burns), choked to death on her own vomit after eating a Kinder Bueno before falling asleep on the sofa, an inquest has heard . Her husband-to-be Geoffrey Burns, who had also fallen asleep, woke up to find his partner's lifeless body slumped onto his knee. Despite him desperately giving CPR to Miss Campbell, she could not be saved. Miss Campbell, who did not drink alcohol, had been taking a variety of prescribed medication to ease abdominal pain which she had suffered after giving birth in October 2013. At an inquest into her death, Mr Burns told the hearing how he had warned Miss Campbell not to eat the bar, incase she fell asleep. He told how the pair had both fallen asleep while watching a film, but that he had woken up around 5.30am to find Miss Campbell unresponsive. He said: 'Candice was eating a stick of Kinder Bueno and I told her not to eat chocolate in case she fell asleep because her medication makes her drowsy. I was worried that she may fall asleep eating it. 'I must have been tired because I fell asleep. I woke up to the dogs barking and Candice's head was on my lap. The first thing I remember saying to her was, ""Wake up, let's go upstairs"". 'I noticed her lips were blue and there was a white foam coming from her nose and food particles at her mouth.' Mr Burns said when he realised she was not responsive, he began CPR. An inquest heard how Miss Campbell was watching a film with her partner at their home in Hull when the pair both drifted off to sleep. Mr Burns told the inquest that he had warned her not to eat the bar (pictured) He said: 'I gave her mouth to mouth and pressed down on her chest as I was taught at first aid. 'I continued to scoop out food from her mouth and I saw there was the Kinder Bueno she was eating before I fell asleep. 'I tried to resuscitate her. I blew twice into her mouth and did 32 compressions.' The inquest heard how Mr Burns then ran 12 doors down the street to Miss Campbell's parents' house to get help. Her father, Ian Gibson, also attempted CPR before they called for an ambulance. Dr Ian Scott, consultant neuropathologist at the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham, carried out the post-mortem examination. He said toxicology tests revealed Miss Campbell had taken several different drugs, including diazepam, tramadol, pregabalin and 'possibly' dihydrocodeine. He said that although Miss Campbell had not taken a 'fatal'

"Bernie Madoff allegedly tried to persuade his drug dealer's girlfriend to become his mistress . Bernie Madoff, who carried out one of the world's largest frauds, tried to persuade his drug dealer's girlfriend to become his mistress, it has emerged. Madoff is serving 150 years in prison for carrying out a $65 billion Ponzi style fraud - which became the largest in financial history. A new book about the financier claims he had put pressure on an Israeli model who was working for him as a stock analyst and dating his dealer Silvio Eboli to sleep with him. He is said to have met Eboli at a Christmas party in 1997 at the Montauk Yacht Club with his son Mark, who later committed suicide over his father's fraudulent activities, Page Six reported. 'Bernie had put enormous pressure on 'Leah' to sleep with him and be his mistress, offering her practically anything if she just let him f*** her,' the book by Toby Rogers states. Eboli is believed to have never confronted Madoff but warned he would injure him if he ever crossed the line with his girlfriend. After 'Leah' became pregnant with Eboli's child in 2001 Madoff apparently summoned her into his office to say she had made a mistake. In the book Madoff is described as bellowing 'You could have had gold. You could have had me. You could have had an apartment, a car, a driver. But instead you throw all that away for some f****** hippie!' Madoff was arrested in December 2008 after he confessed his multi-billion dollar fraud to his two sons and they reported him to the FBI. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009. The charges included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee benefit plan and making false filings with the SEC. Mark Madoff killed himself on the second anniversary of his father's prison sentence. Andrew Madoff, who had been head of equities at his father's New York based company, died last year after a battle with lymphoma, and had previously blamed the stress caused by his father for his relapse. Madoff (left) is pictured with his wife Ruth and his son Mark, who killed himself after his father's arrest . Andrew Madoff, on the Today show with fiance Catherine Hooper, left, and mother Ruth Madoff, right, said he would never forgive his father - not even on his death bed . Earlier this year 76-year-old Madoff wrote a letter from prison saying the pain he inflicted on victims of his Ponzi scheme is nothing compared to having to deal with losing both his sons. Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies. But they were never criminally charged - and never forgave him. The allegations about Madoff's advances towards his dealer's girlfriend are contained in Rogers' book The Ganja Godfather.

"Mike Dean had a good game in very difficult circumstances and over the 90 minutes, to the independent eye, did nothing to add to Jose Mourinho’s claims of a campaign against his team. Sure enough some referees would have waved away appeals for the penalty which Dean awarded against Nemanja Matic, but replays confirmed what I thought when agreeing that the midfielder had caught Sadio Mane before playing the ball. There were some referees who would have given the home side a penalty of their own when Diego Costa was challenged by Jose Fonte. Referee Mike Dean (right) had some tough calls to make in Chelsea's draw with Southampton . Some officials may have waved away this penalty claim awarded to Southampton, as Nemanja Matic brings down Sadio Mane, but replays confirmed midfielder had caught the winger before getting the ball . Chelsea striker Diego Costa appeals for a penalty but is denied this time by Dean . Replays were inconclusive but pundits felt Dean was correct. Had he awarded the penalty of course Jose Fonte would have had to be dismissed. The one decision I had to disagree with was when Matic cynically tripped his opponent and Dean, after due consideration and perhaps realising that Matic was already on a caution, decided to keep his cards in his pocket. Mourinho wisely subbed Matic shortly afterwards. Chelsea could also point to a trip by Tadic on Branislav Ivanovic just inside the penalty area in the first half but to the naked eye at high speed it looked like a dive which Dean did well not to caution. Branislav Ivanovic went down in the box but in real time it looked like a dive - replays showed contact from Tadic but it would have been tough to give . Costa claims he was fouled by Diego Fonte - if the penalty was given the defender would be been sent off . Jose Mourinho claims a campaign against his side but Dean's performance did nothing to support his theory .

"Jailed: Vicky Marks stole £4,200 from vulnerable Joan Groucher while pretending to care for her . A carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90-year-old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her PIN written in her diary. Vicky Marks left her frail victim Joan Groucher 'heartbroken' by abusing her trust to plunder £4,200 from her bank account over a seven-month period. The victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in Croydon, south London and move into sheltered accommodation. Marks, 59, visited Mrs Groucher twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash, using the code written in the elderly woman's diary. She even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital, Croydon Crown Court heard. Sentencing Marks to 12 months in jail, Recorder Silas Reid told her: 'The victim was in her nineties, had problems with dementia, and, effectively, you inveigled your way into her family.' He added: 'It's still unclear to me why you would do that to someone of that age, why you would cause her that much pain, which, in the end, wasn't really for that much money. 'But time and time again you took her card and took money from her account. It seems almost every time you went to her house you would have taken money.' Mrs Groucher, who has four children and eight grand-children, had lived at the same house for around 30 years, but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care. 'One of the features of this case which is disturbing is that she had to leave her home,' Mr Reid said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Groucher said: 'I know Vicky does not have a mother, but that is no reason to do what she did. 'You were trusted by me and I'm heartbroken. It's disgusting what Vicky did to me. It worries me she could have done it to other people.' Paul Fairley, prosecuting, told the court that Mrs Groucher paid Marks £10 every time she visited. The thief's deception was found out when Mrs Groucher's daughter Caroline Baldwin, 70, saw that there was money missing from her bank account in July last year. Hearing: Croydon Crown Court (above) heard Marks even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital . 'She noticed there was £2,000, or £3,000 less than what there should have been,' Mr Fairley said. Mrs Baldwin then took a closer look at her mother's bank statement and noticed 'a pattern of sums of £100 and £200 withdrawn over a significant period of time', he added. She notified the police who checked CCTV footage from the Lloyd's Bank branch in Croydon and identified Marks withdrawing £100 from the victim's account the previous day. Marks, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was arrested and pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing. Speaking outside court today, Mrs Baldwin said her family was 'elated' by the jail

"Love the lighting in these photography shots? They become even more awe-inspiring at the realisation that they're paintings, and someone spent between 50 to 300 hours painstakingly creating them. Patrick Kramer is a 33-year-old artist hailing from Springville, Utah, who specialises in remarkably hyper-realistic paintings. Scroll down for video . Action shot: The artwork of 33-year-old Patrick Kramer is so realistic it's impossible to tell apart from a photo. In this image, he has painted a falling woman with a deeply intricate background . The US artist specialises in beautifully in-depth oil painted portraits, including this intricate black and white portrait of a man called Matt . The paintings, including this of a sleeping young girl called Anna, take the artist up to 50 to 300 hours to complete . It's almost impossible to tell that Kramer's flawless creations are in fact oil paintings due to their incredible pin-sharp detail and clarity. His portrayals vary between vivid city scenes, still-life objects, portraits and breathtaking motion-shots. As well as his portfolio of hyper-realistic paintings, he also constructs more surreal variations on still life, involving insects or inanimate objects in front of a background. One of his images is an imitation of the cover art for musician Drake's 2013 album, Nothing Was the Same. Kramer also paints highly-detailed urban shots, which are impossible to tell apart from a photo . His technique involves building layers of oil paint in order to achieve the intense level of detail . The US artist works from photos and builds up delicate layers of oil paint on a board or canvas. This allows him to add controlled detail and subtle shadowing, which appear almost three-dimensional in the pieces of artwork. Kramer has admitted that an oil painting can take anywhere between 50 to 300 hours (one to six weeks) to complete. The length of time taken depends entirely on the size of the painting and the level of detail. The 33-year-old artist has admitted that this type of artwork suits his precise preferences and personality. Kramer also constructs more surreal imagery of insects, which all still have the same high level of detail - including (left) a dragonfly on an intricate background, and (right) Kramer's painting of a butterfly resting on a wad of letters . Cracks in the surface: The artist, from Utah, specialises in creating exceptionally-realistic works of art. In this case, it is a paintbrush against a background of cracked paint . Kramer said: 'Being a perfectionist, I have always been considering art as an outlet for my slightly obsessive personality. The artist's background and education was also important in honing his interests. 'I studied painting in college, and experimented with hyper realism as a way of perfecting my craft. 'I never intended to pursue the style, but found it hard to give up, as it suited my nature.' Kramer's artwork - including this painting of half-filled glasses - is astounding in its level of clarity . Glass half full or half empty? This painting is incredibly detailed, from the fine fish fins to the

"It weighs just half an ounce and its natural home is a tree. But tiny songbird the blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes non-stop flights of up to 1,700 miles across open ocean, scientists have confirmed. The heroic journeys are 'on the brink of impossibility', according to one of the researchers who attached tracking devices to 40 birds. Long journey: The blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes flights of up to 1,700 miles, flying without stopping to rest, eat or drink across the Atlantic . Experts had long wondered about tantalising clues that suggested the warbler was capable of epic migrations between North and South America. Now they have proof that it really does fly without stopping to rest, eat or drink across the Atlantic. Unlike other migratory songbirds travelling south for the winter, the warbler ignores the safe option of hugging the coastline through Mexico and Central America. Instead it risks death by flying hundreds of miles from land even though it cannot land on water and live. Nice flight: A blackpoll warbler wearing a miniature tracking device . US scientists were astonished when they analysed data from some of the birds they tracked from New England and Canada to the Caribbean, Venezuela and Colombia. Dr Bill DeLuca, from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said: 'It was pretty thrilling to get the return birds back, because their migratory feat in itself is on the brink of impossibility. 'When we accessed the locators, we saw the blackpolls' journey was indeed directly over the Atlantic. The distances travelled ranged from 1,410 to 1,721 miles.' He added: 'For small songbirds, we are only just now beginning to understand the migratory routes that connect temperate breeding grounds to tropical wintering areas. 'We're really excited to report that this is one of the longest non-stop over-water flights ever recorded for a songbird, and finally confirms what has long been believed to be one of the most extraordinary migratory feats on the planet.' For the study, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, the scientists captured 20 birds in Vermont and another 20 in Nova Scotia and fitted them with geolocator packs. The devices, each about the size of a 5p piece, were attached using leg harnesses, much like a rucksack. Too small to house GPS receivers, they operated by means of 'solar geolocation' - a method used for centuries by mariners and explorers. It is based on the fact that day length varies with latitude and the time of solar noon - when the sun is at its highest point in the sky - varies with longitude.

'They're just enjoying each other's company.' Tim Morphew, Folly Farm's zoo manager, said: 'We wanted to mark the occasion and the year anniversary of Peso and Squaddle getting together. 'Everybody who comes to Folly Farm says theirs is a really sweet love story and we wanted to celebrate the fact they were still going strong a year on.' Humboltd penguins, who are monogamous and mate for life, can take a partner aged between two and eight-years-old. Penguins have been observed engaging in homosexual behaviour from as early as 1911. George Murray Levick documented the sexual behaviour of Adélie penguins in Antarctica, but his notes were considered too indecent to publish at the time. They were rediscovered and published in the journal Polar Record a century later in 2012. More recently, a pair of chinstrap penguins called Roy and Silo became a famous 'gay penguin' couple after the New York Times published an article about them in 2004. The penguins, who live in New York's Central Park Zoo, were noticed performing mating rituals in 1998, by staff - although they were never seen to perform sex acts. They were then given an egg to hatch and raise as their own - a practice copied by zoos across the world. Their chick, named Tango, grew up to form a same sex relationship with another female penguin. Their story was the basis for a controversial children's book in 2005 called 'And Tango Makes Three'. But

"A 'perfectionist' straight A student who was stressed about her studies was killed by a speeding train, a coroner heard today. Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school, an inquest into her death was told. Miss Nigam would stay up late studying, resulting in sleep deprivation and a negative impact on her performance at school - which caused further depression and anxiety. Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford heard the teenager, who had been a volunteer at the London Olympics in 2012, was also worried about her appearance. An inquest heard Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school. Stock photo . Tragically, she had first told her parents she was feeling suicidal in 2013 and had even said she would stand in front of a fast train on a Tuesday to take her life - which is how she ultimately died. Miss Nigam had seen a number of doctors over several years, but her father Ankush Nigam told the inquest that she had often refused treatment. He explained that he felt he was 'torturing' his daughter by making her attend appointments - and eventually accepted that she would one day take her life. On February last year, the teenager was struck by a train travelling from London Paddington to Hereford at Twyford railway station in Berkshire. In a statement to the court, train driver Stephen Wood said he saw a pair of legs running into his view from the right as he approached the station. Mr Wood said: 'I saw a person turn towards me and spread their arms wide apart. The train struck this person.' The driver had applied the emergency brake and paramedics were called to the scene, but Miss Nigam, from Lower Earley, Berkshire, died instantly from multiple injuries. Mr Nigam said: 'I'm glad she's in a peaceful place.' He said his daughter first started showing signs of depression and sleep deprivation at 13 and had been on various medication since. The teenager was struck by a train in February last year at Twyford railway station (pictured) in Berkshire . Her doctors had believed she showed improvement when on medication, but she was often reluctant to take it. And Mr Nigam criticised doctors for not believing him and his wife when she said their daughter's condition was worse than she presented to medics. She told doctors she did not want medication for her condition and was not judged to be a suicide risk. But Mr Nigam said his concerns were not taken seriously, even when he explained she had told her parents how she would kill herself in October 2013. He said his daughter had said she knew the times of fast trains and that it would be on a Tuesday. 'That was the first time she made a comment in respect of the train,' he said. 'She clicked her fingers and said it would be instantaneous, so don't worry.' The inquest heard she told doctors she did not

"A mother-of-four whose addiction to Red Bull saw her drinking 24 cans of a day claims she has been cured of her habit by hypnosis. Sarah Weatherill, 31, became so dependent on the energy drink she was told if she cut down too quickly she could suffer a seizure as her body was so used to the caffeine. The law student spent a staggering £5,460 every year on the popular energy drink since she became hooked in 2009. Scroll down for video . Sarah Weatherill, 31, was so addicted to Red Bull she drank 24 cans a day leaving her lethargic, depressed, suffering heart palpitations and constantly anxious . Her habit was at its worst the following year when she was studying for a law degree and wanted to stay awake to revise for exams. She soon became dependent on the drink and couldn't get out of bed unless she knew she had some in the fridge. She also became lethargic, depressed, had heart palpitations and was constantly feeling anxious as her £105-a-week habit spiralled out of control. She finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the Red Bull was severely damaging her health. And after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month, she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50-minute session. Her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains: . 80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso. 27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar. 10g Taurine (an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance). B vitamins. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half the potentially lethal dose. Ms Weatherill, from Coventry, said: 'I was studying for a Higher National Certificate in law in 2005 and used to have the odd Red Bull for a pick me up. 'It is hard to say when it became every day but I remember that by 2009 I was definitely hooked. 'Whenever I felt tired having a Red Bull would be the first thing I would do. 'It was worst in 2010 when I was doing law exams at university and my children were off school. 'Sometimes I would have exams day after day - and with the stress of revising I was having 24 cans a day. 'I was pulling all-nighters and using the drinks to stay awake. In the end, it got to the point where I just needed Red Bull to function. 'I used to get my shopping delivered and used to have four or five crates and that only lasted for a week - it got out of hand. 'There would be times

"The first people to be affected by Qantas’s newly enforced 'smart casual' dress code have taken to social media to complain after being turned away from the airline’s lounges for wearing thongs. Qantas warned back in February that it would begin strictly enforcing its business class lounge dress code from April 1 - but not everyone got the memo. Cassandra Hann‎ wrote on Qantas’s Facebook wall on Thursday: ‘Thanks Qantas club Perth for refusing me entry because I was wearing Havianas (I am going on holidays after all).’ Ms Hann fumed: ‘I had just got off a long flight from Sydney to Perth with a tired 15 year old and 3 year old and had to wait at Perth airport for 3 hours for our connecting flight to Learmouth. I was told Qantas have now started to ""enforce"" their Qantas club lounge dress regulations which bans thongs.’ The mother said she never got an email to inform her about the new rules and managed to get into the Qantas lounge in Sydney on the same day while wearing thongs. Scroll down for video . People wearing thongs are no longer allowed in the Qantas lounges around Australia . Disgruntled customers who did not get the memo about the newly enforced Qantas dress code have posted their complaints on social media . ‘Because my kids needed to rest for the 3 hours we were stuck in Perth airport I had to go and buy another pair of shoes as my other shoes were in my checked in luggage. $80 later, a pair of shoes I didn't need nor want and we finally are allowed to enter the lounge,’ she said. ‘This is no way to treat a long term loyal club member who pays plenty of money per year to be a member. If you want to take hundreds of dollars of membership fees off us every year you could at least have sent members a letter or an email informing us of dress regulation changes. Poor effort Qantas. No wonder people are flying other airlines and joining other lounges.’ In February Helen Gray, Qantas' Head of Domestic Product & Service, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From April 2015, customers entering domestic Qantas Clubs and Business Lounges in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney will receive a friendly reminder about the smart casual dress guidelines that apply.' Cassandra Hann‎ said she was refused entry to Qantas Club because she was wearing Havianas . Sex worker Estelle Lucas, from Melbourne, tried to see the upside to the situation . Qantas were unable to be specific about what items of clothing would be banned but said: ‘The vast majority of our members meet and exceed the guidelines, but we have had some feedback from customers that they want to see those guidelines apply to everyone.

"'Revenge of the Nerds' actor Robert Carradine has been cited with careless driving after crossing into oncoming traffic and slamming into a tractor-trailer. Carradine, 60, and his wife, Edie Mani, were both injured in the afternoon crash on March 5 near Dolores, in the state's southwestern corner, but the injuries are not life-threatening. According to the Colorado State Patrol, the actor's 2003 Mercury Marauder crossed into the oncoming lane on Colorado Highway 145 and collided with the tractor-trailer.

The truck driver, 59-year-old Richard Clayton of Wisconsin, wasn't injured, Trooper Josh Lewis said. James Saunders of the state patrol told The Durango Herald that neither alcohol nor speeding was a factor in the crash. Images of the scene also show that it was not snowing or raining at the time. 'The fact that they were wearing seat belts is why they are with us today,' he said. The area of the highway was shut for more than two hours following the crash.

"Promposals are the big trend in high school proms as teens think up progressively more outlandish ways to ask each other to the biggest dance of the year. They are so big, in fact, that students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual, according to a new survey. With budgets for outfits, flowers, transportation, food and other sundries at around $1,000 for the average American high schooler, that means most intend to spend $324 on the once-simple query: Will you go to prom with me? Pricey promposals: Students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual of promposals, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by Visa .

"Even if all it amounts to is a handful of visits to England's training camp to spend a few hours observing the players and offering some pointers, the prospect of Jonny Wilkinson being involved with the national team is an enticing one. Nothing is certain at this stage, but it is not out of the question that the iconic fly-half will agree to give his input as Stuart Lancaster's squad prepare for the World Cup. If the 35-year-old hero of the 2003 triumph does take on a role of sorts — and that would appear to be a big if — it wouldn't be as a coach and it might not even amount to a consultancy, certainly not on a regular basis. Jonny Wilkinson could lend his expertise to England's 2015 rugby World Cup preperations . Wilkinson, who was a fly-half, kicked the winning drop goal to lead England to World Cup glory in 2003 . Wilkinson has been getting involved with rugby coaching and could aid England's World Cup preparations . England coach Stuart Lancaster would not ignore the opportunity to use Wilkinson's know-how . But most England supporters would settle for Wilkinson popping into the HQ in Surrey on his way to the supermarket, if there was any chance of some of that stardust and winner's mentality rubbing off on the class of 2015. It is all about the aura. Here is a man who was once the nation's sporting darling, while in rugby circles he is treated with a mixture of respect and awe. In the south of France, where he worked wonders for Toulon in the closing years of his career, he is adored. When false rumours surfaced at the start of the year that he was destined for a knighthood, they were assumed to be correct. Such an honour would have surprised no one. The current generation of England players grew up admiring his epic deeds. The fly-halves in particular — George Ford, Owen Farrell and Danny Cipriani — could learn so much from the maestro. Stuart Lancaster has an established coaching group and there are no plans to expand it, for now. At present, Mike Catt works with the kickers in camp, while another RFU coach, Jon Callard, has also spent time with them, though less so recently. Ford has private sessions with Wilkinson's kicking mentor, the renowned Dave Alred, who has not had a role in the national set-up since the last World Cup. But any chance to tap into the know-how of one of the country's all-time greats, with his legendary work ethic and meticulous approach, would not be casually ignored by Lancaster. Wilkinson has spoken of his interest in the option of working as a specialist coach or tutor, and has done so part-time with Toulon this season. Wilkinson (centre) is revered in Toulon, where he spent the final years of his career as a player . Lancaster already has one 2003 World Cup winner in his coaching ranks in Mike Catt (centre) Wilkinson's input could help England's current fly-halfs such as George

"Finding that dream wedding dress usually requires months of saving and trawling expensive bridal shops. But now brides-to-be can buy their gown during the weekly grocery shop online – for just £80. Tesco’s clothing brand F&F has launched what is estimated to be the cheapest bridal gown on the market. And the dress, which is exclusively available on Tesco’s website, is simple enough to be worn again instead of stashed away in a cupboard and forgotten. It comes in sizes six to 18 and features a quirky lace neckline and a flattering fit to suit all body shapes. Scroll down for video . Tesco value: The supermarket's clothing brand F&F has launched what is estimated to be the cheapest bridal gown on the market. It is available online for just £80 and can be worn again rather than being stashed away . Aside from the lace bust, the dress is a mixture of nylon, cotton and polyester. The cheaper materials mean it can be handwashed at home. However, if this design isn’t the one you envisage saying ‘I do’ in, there are a growing number of cheaper than usual gowns now available on the High Street. Ghost sells an embroidered mesh wedding dress for £295 and Phase Eight offers a vintage-inspired lace gown, priced £395. In Monsoon, bridal gowns start at £169, and in Coast they cost between £175 and £250. Last night a wedding expert said the rise of low-priced gowns reflects a growing number of couples seeking to cut wedding costs. Caroline Hendry, editor of hitched.co.uk, said: ‘There will always be a place in the bridal market for designer gowns but it’s great that the new wedding dress from F&F at Tesco offers something stylish for brides on a budget.

"The Liberal Democrats have admitted they are on course to lose at least 20 MPs, but claim this could still be enough to put them back in power. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed. But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Eastleigh in Hampshire . Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet

But for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters. The child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground . At least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. It is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time. A large amount of research, according to Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors. This graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter . The latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green. Researchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters. They then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990. The results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set. Among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent. The colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row) Red bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent . Synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. Some people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell

"Out there in celebrity land, in the mink-lined nurseries of the filthy rich, a new breed of fearsomely spoilt children are being raised by their fearsomely spoilt parents. These indulged tots are hatched into a world where budgets have no bounds and reality is a misty blur on the ever-golden horizon. Look at them. They are in furs before they are five, Chanel before six and in bed by seven. And while dressed in the finest of clothes, they eat in the best restaurants, are entertained like emperors and hot-housed in luxury that would make a sultan blush. Meanwhile, the gruesome irony of being given designer shoes before they can walk and expensive birthday parties before they can talk seems to be lost on their crazed, doting, cash-scattering parents. Scroll down for video . First birthday bling: Tama Ecclestone's little girl Sophia . Thank goodness the tots always have a gem-encrusted rattle to hand, perhaps to shake at the folly of it all. Take Tamara Ecclestone. You can always depend on Tams to raise the pamper bar to hitherto unheard of heights of deluxe lunacy — and this week she did not let us down. The 30-year-old daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone and her husband, Jay Rutland, have just returned from a holiday in Italy to celebrate his birthday. Before their next holiday, they had the small matter of celebrating daughter Sophia’s first birthday this week — and Tamara was determined it was an event that would never be forgotten. Not by Sophia, who is too young to have a coherent thought running through her gorgeous little head. But by everyone else who goggled at the £70,000 or so spent on turning the front courtyard of their London home into Sophia’s very own petting zoo, complete with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra. A rather glum-looking zebra, to be honest, but in terms of competitive party-throwing, the little critter certainly earned his stripes. There was also a real live princess, complete with a wimple, and a platoon of security men delivering gift-wrapped presents for the lucky baby. In pride of place was a rather garish gazebo made entirely of pink balloons with Sophia’s initials picked out in white. As well as a petting zoo with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra, Sophie was also lucky enough to have a decadent princess palace created out of pink and white balloons . If you have ever wondered what a doctor would see while performing liver surgery on Mr Blobby, wonder no more. Tamara also posted photographs on social media of Sophia enjoying her birthday breakfast in her couture pyjamas, surrounded by giant soft toys and a whispering forest of helium balloons. Another gift, wrapped with a pink velvet ribbon, awaited her perusal on her high chair tray. What and who was all this lavish fuss for? Certainly not for the child, who would have been as puzzled as the zebra about what was going on. However, events like this somehow seem to be more about making an affluent statement than

"One diner found her meal had extra crunch this week when she found 50 pearls inside the baked oyster she was feasting on. Toni Elliot, 53, thought she had hurt a tooth when she sat for dinner at Puckett's Boat House in Franklin, Tennessee, on Thursday. However, when she spat out the mouthful she was chewing she discovered a pearl in the palm of her hand. Forty-nine precious stones followed. Instead of being horrified by the bizarre discovery, Elliot reportedly remained calm and even posed for photos with her treasure afterwards. Scroll down for video . Not what I ordered: Toni Elliot, 53, (right) found her meal had extra crunch this week when she found 50 pearls inside the baked oyster she was feasting on at Puckett's Boat House in Franklin, Tennessee . As naturally-occurring pearls are rare, it's expected that Elliot's stash could fetch a princely sum. Eric Horton, who was serving Elliot at the time, said he couldn't believe what he saw happening. He swiftly grabbed a container to collect the pearls up from Eliot's dinner plate. Recalling the incident, he told WSMV News: 'It happens sometimes, every once in a while. 'However, this young lady continued to pull pearls out of her mouth, and the only thing we were missing was a string because she found 50 pearls in this one oyster.' Puckett's Boat House thought it could have broken a record for the most pearls in one oyster but apparently the number stands somewhere in the eighties . Eliot's fellow diners apparently laughed as they watched the unusual scene unfold. Puckett's Boat House thought it could have broken a record for the most pearls in one oyster but apparently the number stands somewhere in the eighties. The eatery said it was the first time such an incident had occurred in its history. Sometimes diners find one pearl in a mollusk but anything more is extremely rare.. Puckett's Boat House says it gets their oysters from the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana. Producing pearls is an oyster’s way of protecting itself against foreign substances, such as a parasite or piece of shell.

"Barack Obama did not call Kanye West at home - despite the rapper's claims to the contrary- but a presidential staffer did ring to set up a future chat, sources have claimed. The back-and-forth began a couple of weeks ago, when Kanye boasted about his close relationship with the most powerful man in the world during a speech at Oxford University. Kanye, who is married to Kim Kardashian, claimed that Mr Obama would call him at home, and he would call Obama 'out of the blue'. Scroll down for video . Kanye West (left) has admitted Barack Obama (right) did not call him at home – but a source close to rapper claims a presidential staffer did set up a future chat . 'Obama calls the home phone by the way,' he added. Last week, Mr Obama was forced to deny the claims during an appearance on chat show Jimmy Kimmel Live, saying he didn't even have Kanye's home number. When asked about Kanye's claims about their friendship, he replied: 'I met Kanye twice. 'The first time was when I was a senator and he was with his mom and he had just gotten big… And then about six months ago he came to an event. I love his music.' President Barack Obama had dismissed the claims he called rapper West at home during at appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live (pictured) 'I don't think I've got his home number.' But Kanye refused to back down, and made the bizarre assertion again when questioned by a TMZ reporter at LAX Airport. After the Kimmel interview was aired, Kanye told reporters at LAX Airport 'I love Obama, he called our house before' Despite Mr Obama's flat-out denial, the outspoken rapper still insisted that he would contact him at home. 'I love Obama, he called our house before,' he claimed. 'He knows that, don't try and pit us against each other.' Now the truth appears to have finally been revealed after sources close Kanye said a presidential staffer had contacted the West home to set up a potential future chat with Mr Obama. A source told TMZ that the president had attended a celebrity- filled breakfast in Beverly Hills last October where he spoke about using star power to get people to vote. When it was over Mr Obama told guests including Kim and Kanye he wanted to set up a call to continue the conversation. Afew days later, a staffer reportedly called to follow up. The president has praised Kanye's music but has previously labelled the singer a 'jackass' after his 2009 MTV Video Music Awards antics during Taylor Swift's acceptance speech.

"(CNN)The fury of Tropical Cyclone Pam, one of the most powerful storms ever to make landfall, has moved on, but the misery it left behind in the islands of Vanuatu is just starting to become apparent. Aid workers described scenes of extensive devastation in the capital, Port Vila, and expressed fears of even more destruction farther afield. Thousands were in need of shelter, food and water, the Red Cross said Sunday. ""Homes have been lost, crops are destroyed. The damage is enormous, and people need our help,"" said Aurelia Balpe, head of the Red Cross in the Pacific. ""Yet it will still take some time before we really understand the full extent of the damage."" The storm flattened houses, scattered trees across roads and inflicted damage on key buildings meant to serve as safe havens, such as the hospital, schools and churches. ""It's becoming increasingly clear that we are now dealing with worse than the worst-case scenario in Vanuatu,"" said Helen Szoke, executive director in Australia for the aid group Oxfam. ""This is likely to be one of the worst disasters ever seen in the Pacific."" At least 90% of housing in Port Vila has been badly damaged, parts of the hospital are flooded and the state mortuary took a hit, Oxfam said. Some 60,000 children are in need of assistance, UNICEF reported Sunday. How to help Vanuatu residents . At least six people have been confirmed dead. But communications with many of the 80-plus islands in the archipelago are down, so the fear is that the toll will climb as more information emerges. The confirmed deaths, reported by the National Disaster Management Office, are just from Port Vila. For most of a 24-hour period between Friday and Saturday, the cyclone pummeled Vanuatu, where some 260,000 people live, many in flimsy homes built of thatch. It is unclear how many thousands of people have been displaced by the massive storm, which had the power of a Category 5 hurricane when it made landfall. Aerial assessments are being carried out by military aircraft from New Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand. Relief workers are raising concerns about a lack of clean water and sanitation for the many people left homeless. Aid has started to trickle in. The Australian government said a first contingent of officials and supplies arrived in Port Vila around noon Sunday and more flights were expected to follow. ""In Port Vila, there's a lot of activity now -- people are starting to emerge,"" said Tom Perry of the aid group CARE International. ""You can see trees that are strewn across roads being chopped down. The evacuation centers are beginning to be set up."" Perry, who arrived on one of the first Australian military flights into Port Vila, told CNN the damage there was ""very significant"" with trees that looked like ""snapped toothpicks."" ""It's like a bomb has gone through,"" said journalist Michael McLennan, who lives in Port Vila. ""It's really quite apocalyptic."" Most buildings in the capital were destroyed or damaged, he told CNN on Sunday. Many roads were blocked by

"Mountain bikers and cross-country runners are at risk from the deadly stomach bug E.coli if they get splashed with mud, doctors warned today. Medics at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary say they treated a 23-year-old cyclist for an E.coli 0157 infection after he was admitted to the hospital suffering from vomiting, abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. The man - a vegetarian - said he had not eaten undercooked meat or vegetables, nor had he spent time with livestock or visiting farms before falling ill. A man was treated for E. coli which doctors believe he contracted after taking part in a Tough Mudder event and was splashed with infected mud (file picture) But eight days before his symptoms began the man had competed in a cycling event along wet, muddy tracks in eastern Scotland. He, along with other competitors, had removed the mudguards from his bicycle to reduce weight, and mud and water had splashed on his face during the race. It is thought this was how he became infected with the bug, which can be found in animal faeces and farm slurry. The man said he had taken part in a 'Tough Mudder' event, which involves a 10 -12 mile race with obstacles such as climbing vertical walls and plunging through ice pools. The cyclist, who has not been identified, recovered - but the doctors have highlighted his case in the Journal of Infection Prevention. Writing in the research paper, the doctors warned: 'Sporting endeavours such as cycling and cross-country running events often take participants through such high-risk areas and may be an important cause of contact with E. coli 0157. 'This case highlights such exposure and should alert clinicians to the possibility of E.coli 0157 infection and the importance of individuals presenting with bloody diarrhoea with a history of participation in similar sporting or other events.' Escherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness. Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk. The incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is usually 3-4 days, but it's possible for symptoms to take longer to appear (up to two weeks). Source: NHS Choices . Dr Robert Laing, consultant physician in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and co-author of the journal article, said: 'We know that E.coli 0157 survives well in cattle faeces. 'This case highlights the possible risk to participants in sports that expose them to mud that may have been contaminated by animal faeces. 'Splashes to the face are likely to be particularly hazardous and efforts should be made to protect yourself from these as far as possible.' E.coli 0157, which lives in the gut of animals, is usually associated with food poisoning or drinking contaminated water. Scotland has a particularly high incidence of the strain, with more than twice as many cases than other parts of the UK. In 2012, three people

"Siem de Jong is targeting Newcastle's home clash with Swansea later this month for a return to senior action after an eight-month injury nightmare. The 26-year-old Holland international midfielder played 45 minutes for the club's Under-21s team on Wednesday evening after competing his recovery from surgery to repair a collapsed lung. Head coach John Carver has hinted that De Jong could even make the 18 for Sunday's Barclays Premier League fixture against Tottenham at St James' Park, and while the Dutchman has not ruled that out, his sights are set the Swans' visit to Tyneside on the following weekend. Newcastle playmaker Siem de Jong is hopeful of returning to the first-team before the end of the season . He told nufcTV: 'I don't think I could play 90 minutes in the coming weeks, so it will be maybe as a substitute at the end of the game, but I don't know if I will be on the bench... We haven't discussed yet when I'll be back. 'But I hope Swansea - I don't know yet if Tottenham would be a good time, but I hope to be back on the bench against Swansea, depending on how it goes in the coming days and depending on how I feel tomorrow after today. 'We'll see how it goes. I still have to get a little bit stronger, a little bit more explosive, a little faster, and hopefully I can work on that in the coming days.' De Jong, a £6million summer signing from Ajax, has made just three senior appearances for the club, the last of them in a 3-3 home draw with Crystal Palace on August 30 last year - his only league start to date. The summer signing has been plagued by injuries since arriving from Ajax but is close to full fitness . Injury hit when he badly tore a thigh muscle in training days later and was sidelined until February, when disaster struck once again as he suffered a collapsed lung for the second time in his career. He took the first tentative steps towards a first-team return at St James' Park on Wednesday evening, and while he knows there is more hard work to be done, he is glad to be back and already looking towards the start of next season. De Jong said: 'I haven't repaid the fans a lot this season, so I hope to be playing a couple of games, maybe, at the end of the season. 'But I have to focus on next season and be really fit then and hopefully I can show the fans what I can do, and show myself and show my team-mates what I can do.' John Carver will be looking to put Newcastle's dreadful run to an end having lost their last five matches .

"'Absolutely no peas!' booms Luis as he dispatches me to the market. I'm in Valencia, Spain's third largest city. Not for the Las Fallas festival (a huge affair every March when giant papier-mache figures of politicians are burned amid lively street celebrations), but for its other claim to fame - it is the home of paella. Luis is a top chef who leads paella-making classes. But first I have to get the ingredients. Dinner is served: Paella originated in Valencia, using ingredients which could be sourced cheaply and locally . The central market is in a glorious art nouveau building in the old quarter, with more than 500 stalls selling every Spanish food imaginable. I buy an 'arrangement' of rabbit and chicken portions from a butcher. Then I choose three different types of beans. Paella Valenciana was created from what was easily available to local farmers. This meant rice from the local paddy fields, and beans, rabbit and chicken from their land. It's wrong to add peas, as we Brits do, apparently. Under Luis's watchful eye, I learn how to chop the meat and cook it and the beans in different parts of the pan. I sieve fresh tomato and dabble in smoked pimento for flavour. The secret is about how to put the rice into the water. Luis tells me to add it in two straight lines in the form of a cross (seemingly, for perfect absorption). I add fresh rosemary, remembering to remove it after ten minutes. It seems to work and in around 20 minutes my glossy, golden rice dish is complete. Delicious, though I say so myself. Luis awards me my diploma: I am now a 'paella ambassador'. If you want to know more about this famous dish and its variations, contact Patrick Waller. Originally from Bromley, he moved to Valencia 23 years ago when he fell in love with a local, Julia Espin. A real mixed bag: True paella can contain seafood and rabbit - but should never feature peas . They run the Paella Project, taking in all aspects of buying fresh produce at the market, cooking classes, wine tastings and a visit to Xativa in the hills with lessons and meal preparation outdoors. You can also explore the famous rice fields of the Albufera National Park, just 15 minutes outside Valencia. They blew me away. You can take a boat trip on the vast lagoon or enjoy the pine-fringed, wild beaches and restaurants of nearby El Saler village. Valencia has fantastic white beaches, too, just five minutes from the city centre. There are endless orange tree patios (proper orange juice everywhere); walks along the former Turia riverbed; the Unesco listed Lonja (silk hall), which dates to1548; and superb shopping, including five El Corte Ingles department stores. Balconies of intricate metal designs and specialist cafes called horchaterias, with marble-topped tables serving a traditional Valencian drink made from tiger nuts and sugar, remind me this is the real Spain.

"Saddened: Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have 'furious' about the release of That Which Does Not Kill Us, the fourth book in the Millennium series . Stieg Larsson's partner has hit out at plans to release a fourth installment in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series more than a decade after the journalist's death - dismissing it as nothing more than a money-making scheme. Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have 'furious' about the release of That Which Does Not Kill Us, which will hit the shelves in August to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of the hugely successful Girl with a Dragon Tattoo. Gabrielsson - the left wing journalist's partner of more than three decades - has not only questioned the motivation of the publishing house, but been hugely critical of the author chosen to follow in her late partner's footsteps. David Lagercrantz, a journalist and author best known as footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic's official biographer, is 'a completely idiotic choice' in her view. 'They say heroes are supposed to live forever. That's a load of c***, this is about money,' she said. 'It's about a publishing house that needs money, (and) a writer who doesn't have anything to write so he copies someone else.' Larsson had, in fact, begun work on a fourth book centering on protagonists Lisbeth Salander, a feisty rebel hacker-turned-detective, and Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter, before his untimely death in 2004. Aged just 50, he suffered a heart attack as he walked the seven storeys to his office, where he worked as a journalist and editor of anti-fascist magazine Expo. The books were published posthumously, so Larsson never saw how successful the books were to become: so far, they have sold more than 75million copies in more than 30 languages, according to publisher Norstedts. However, Gabrielsson, 61, has dismissed any idea he had an overarching plan for the novels - a theory which has been used to justify the publication of this latest 500 page tome. She also revealed Lagercrantz had not seen the fourth manuscript, and 'started over from zero'. 'Everyone thinks there was some grand scheme but no, he had no plan for the first three books and when he started writing the fourth one, it was spontaneous. He still didn't have a plan,' she said. If it were up to her, none of this would have happened. 'I wouldn't have continued Stieg's work. It was his language, his unique narrative.' Furious?: Stieg Larsson - who died in 2004, before his trilogy became successful - had started work on the next book, but David Lagercrantz, who has picked up the baton, has started from scratch with his version . Gabrielsson says she views Lagercrantz is 'a completely idiotic choice' to continue Larsson's work, with even the 'very literary' title sitting badly with her. She said: '[He] comes from a completely different background. Everything has always been easy for him. He's never been an activist. Everything is wrong.' Gabrielsson, who met Larsson as a teenager, added: 'Let him dig his own

"In these fantastic images you can see Mars and its moons, an amazing nebula and even the surface of a mysterious world covered in water. Or can you? These might look like pictures of space at first, but they’re actually just shots of glasses of water and food in a photocopier. The amazing photography trick was performed by 34-year-old freelance photographer Navid Baraty from New York. New York photographer Navid Baraty has created fictional images of space using ingredients found in the kitchen. Shown is a 'spiral galaxy', made with baking soda, curry powder, chalk, salt, sugar and cinnamon . The project follows an imaginary spacecraft called Wander - Wormhole-Accelerated Nomad Delivering Reconnaissance - which you can follow on Instagram, Facebook or his website. In the images he used common kitchen ingredients to make the cosmic images. - Glass containing water and food colouring . - Salt, cinnamon, baking powder . - Cat fur, cumin, tumeric . - Coffee, corn starch, butter . He told MailOnline that the images were made by placing objects on an Epson photo scanner and then doing a scan with the lid open. He then partially filled glasses with liquids and put food colouring in them in order to create shapes and swirls. The stars and other points of light, meanwhile, are made by sprinkling spices such as cinnamon on the scanner glass. ‘I've had a fascination with space ever since I was a kid camping in the backyard and looking at the stars through my childhood telescope,’ he said. ‘When I see the cosmos through photographs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and other spacecraft, I’m often left without words. ‘When I look at the night sky, I’m captivated by its mystery and its unknowns. I think the awe and wonder of space ignites our innate curiosity as humans.’ This Mars-lke planet consists of the bottom of a glass containing half and half, water and food colouring. Moons at the bottom of a glass contain coconut milk, wate and food colouring. The stars are salt, cinnamon, baking powder and tums . All the images were taken in a photocopier. Here we see a nebula with gas streams - but it is actually cat fur, garlic powder, salt, flour, cumin and turmeric, according to Mr Baraty .

One of the nebulas was created using cat fur, garlic powder, salt, flour, cumin and turmeric. And Mr Baraty says he intends to continue take the photos, so people can keep following the fictional progress of the Wander probe . ‘I thought it would be fun and exciting to frame the project around the idea of this imaginary spacecraft roaming around the universe taking photos of its

"A 20-year-old mother accused of beating her two-year-old son to death last year and then burying his body in a shallow grave has given birth to another baby while in custody. Meagan Work, from Austin, Texas, gave birth to a son in February, Fox7 reported, but it is not known if she gave birth in jail or at the hospital, or if she was permitted to spend time with him. Child Protective Services took the child into state custody and on Monday, a hearing was held to determine if he will stay in foster care or live with a family member, KVUE reported. Officials told the channel that State District Judge Darlene Byrne will likely make a decision in upcoming days where to place the baby boy. In custody: Meagan Work, pictured left in a mug shot, gave birth to a baby boy while in custody last month, five months after she was arrested in the death of her two-year-old son Colton, pictured right . The baby's father is believed to be Michael Brandt Turner, who is also charged in the death of Work's two-year-old son, Colton Brandt Turner. Michael Turner was not Colton's biological father. Work was four months pregnant when she was arrested in her son's death last September after his remains were found hidden in a wooded area. A friend who was concerned about the boy's whereabouts had contacted authorities. Following the call, investigators interviewed Turner at San Saba County Jail, where he was being held on unrelated offenses. A day later, Turner took them to the site where he admitted burying the body in July. A witness told police that he had seen Work slam her son's head against a truck before shaking and slapping him on July 7. Work, who had been living out of her car or with friends in the months before the death, told police different stories about her son's whereabouts, including that he had been kidnapped from their car and that she had given him to a couple she met in a restaurant. Killed: Colton's body was found in a shallow grave in a wooded area last September. His mother, pictured, had different accounts of what had happened to him but eventually admitted he had died in a motel room . Abuse: Relatives posted pictures of bruises and scratches across his body before he died. CPS had two open complaints against his mother when he died but because she was homeless, they could not find her . She eventually told investigators he died in motel room, according to an arrest affidavit. After his death, it emerged that relatives had shared photos of his injured body on Facebook, including deep scratches and bruises to his head and back. Texas Child Protective Services had received four total complaints beginning when Colton was about six months old, KVUE reported at the time. Accused: Work's boyfriend Michael Turner, 29, led authorities to the boy's buried body last year . Two of the complaints had been resolved and the other two were open and ongoing when investigators discovered

"He's famous for being really, really ridiculously good looking but Britain's answer to Zoolander, insists he's nothing like the airheaded movie character. In fact, there's far more to top male model David Gandy, 35, than posing in pants - he's going into business as a shoe brand owner. And competition with fellow Essex boy, David Beckham, drives him every step of the way, he revealed in a new interview with Red Magazine. Britain's top male model David Gandy doesn't want to be seen as a 'brainless idiot' any more . David recently bought luxury footwear brand David Preston in a bid to be taken seriously. He said: 'Models are as popular as bankers! You're seen as a brainless idiot – paid a fortune to do very little. I don't want to just be known as the man in the pants.' Yet he jokes that whatever he chooses to do, Becks follows soon after. 'Well, I did the white pants in 2006, and then he did Armani. I became an ambassador for whisky, and now he has his whisky brand,' he said. 'I don't think we're in competition, though, and hopefully people should be proud there are two Essex guys taking on the world, promoting Britishness.' As an ambitious entrepreneur, Gandy is determined to revitalise homegrown businesses and concerns. David Gandy delivers his best blue steel in a new shoot - and shows off the shoes made by his new luxury footwear brand David Preston . David Gandy jokes that he's in competition with another David - fellow Essex boy Becks . The April issue of Red is out today . He said: 'We're terrible at investing in our own companies. It upsets me that half the companies on Savile Row aren't British-owned. 'When I see a small British company I believe in, I'm in the privileged position to give it a chance. London is an extraordinary place to be, and we should be proud of our great brands. 'I'm proud to have stuck here. I belong to England.' And while pop idols such as Harry Styles and Justin Bieber may have most girls' attention, David, who's reunited with Saturdays singer Mollie King, is proud to be seen as a grown man. 'We've become so obsessed by boys. There's almost a backlash against true men. Where are the Paul Newmans or Steve McQueens of the world?' The muscled adonis recently showcased his enviable physique in his range of underwear for M&S, but he offers words of comfort to the average man. 'Of course [I have fat days!] I work hard at it. At the gym there are people with all the gear and no idea, and then people in scruffy tracksuit bottoms working hard. That's me at the end of the day.' The full interview appears in the April issue of Red, on sale today. Also available in digital edition on Apple Newsstand, visit https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/red-magazine-uk/id469365517?mt=8; .

"An investigation into the shark meat sold at fish and chips stores has found the majority of retailers are mislabelling their produce. Eleven of the 23 Melbourne fish and chips shops examined by Greenpeace were found to be selling the overfished school shark despite advertising it as the sustainable gummy shark or 'flake' - a term that is only meant to be used for gummy shark or New Zealand's similar rig shark. Less than half of the stores, which had samples of their raw fillets DNA tested by the University of Canberra in September last year, were found to be accurately labelling their 'fish'. Greenpeace has investigated the shark species used by 23 Melbourne fish and chips shops as part of their campaig for restaurants to reveal the origin and type of their seafood . One of the restaurants labelling their fillets as gummy shark was found to be serving rig shark while another which was advertising flake was unable to be identified. 'Aussies are being sold 'fake' and chips, not flake and chips because of Australia's shoddy labelling laws,' campaigner Nathaniel Pelle said. 'Australians are being kept in the dark about where their seafood comes from, the type of fish they are eating, and how it reached their plate.' The results have formed part of the campaigning organisation's argument for the federal government to improve Australia's food labelling laws, demanding that they include a requirement for restaurants and take-away stores to declare the country of origin of their food. Eleven of the 23 Melbourne fish and chips shops examined by Greenpeace were found to be selling the overfished school shark (pictured) despite advertising it as gummy shark or flake . Greenpeace claims that current legislation does not require them to identify the fish type or origin. Its research further suggests that at least 80 per cent of the squid and octopus sold in Australia is caught overseas from overfished origins while two thirds of the popular fish type barramundi is brought in from Asia. Great concern has also been placed on the fate of many 'orange roughy' fish, which despite being managed through conservation efforts in Australia, is often sold under different names at various restaurants. Less than half of the stores, which had their raw fish DNA tested by the University of Canberra in September last year, were found to be accurately labelling their 'fish' as gummy shark (pictured) or flake . 'It is not possible for consumers to make an informed decision under these conditions — a situation that may result in negative environmental and health outcomes,' Ms Pelle said. 'Australians deserve labelling laws that tell us what fish we're eating, where it was caught and how it was caught.' To find out more about Greenpeace's Label My Fish campaign, visit labelmyfish.com.

"Dinner with Arnold Palmer on Thursday night clearly agreed with World No 1 Rory McIlroy. All those indifferent rounds in Florida so far this year were swept aside on Friday as the Northern Irishman notched up five birdies in a row at one point on his way to a superb 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. It was the first time in eight rounds in the Sunshine State this year that he had broken 70 and what a way to do it. From out of the pack, the 25 year old is now bang in contention for a morale-boosting victory in his last scheduled start before his attempt to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters next month. Rory McIlroy hit a second round of 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Friday . It was the first time in eight rounds in Florida this year that the World No 1 had broken 70 . McIlroy looks to have played himself back into form ahead of the Masters next month . ‘I’m just feeling more comfortable day by day, and it was great to see a few putts finally drop,’ said McIlroy, whose performance drew a glowing tribute from his good friend and playing partner, Rickie Fowler. ‘After what I saw today and the fact he’s clearly the best player in the world, he has to be the favourite for the Masters,’ said the American, who was pipped at the post to both The Open and USPGA Championships last year by McIlroy. ‘That course suits his game. He didn’t start out hot today but when he gets it going as he did on the back nine, it’s hard to hang with him. If he continues to play like that, he will be ready for Augusta, for sure.’ Fowler was right when he said nothing appeared to be happening for McIlroy over his front nine, the inward half on the course. In fact, he’d played much better on the first day, when he opened with a 70. But after finally getting a putt to drop at the second, and enjoying a small stroke of fortune at the third, where his pulled drive carried a water hazard by just a couple of yards, it all started to click. A good wedge to the third green set up a birdie and then came his third in a row at the par five fourth. At the fifth his wedge shot finished 18 inches away and then came another birdie at the long sixth, where he got up and down from a greenside bunker. ‘It’s a lovely feeling when you get on runs like that and the game suddenly feels very easy,’ he said. Fowler's good friend and playing partner Rickie Fowler admitted McIlroy is now favourite for the Masters . McIlroy had five birdies in a row in Dubai earlier this year but this was the first time he had enjoyed such a run in an event on the PGA Tour, and it electrified the huge galleries at Bay Hill. By this stage he had

"Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton got her budding presidential campaign's first targeted question about the deadly 2012 Benghazi terror attacks on Tuesday night, and her answer was the sound of one hand clapping. The bash-the-rich candidate flew first class from Boston to Washington, D.C. after wrapping up a two-day New Hampshire campaign trip. Daily Mail Online was on the flight. 'Mrs. Clinton, when are you going to start talking to the press about Benghazi?' Daily Mail Online asked her in the Washington Reagan National Airport terminal. 'Did you make mistakes?' The usually garrulous and broad-smiling Clinton stared straight ahead, continued walking alongside her Secret Service and local police escorts, and said nothing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NO COMMENT: Hillary stared ahead and walked wordlessly Tuesday, refusing to acknowledge her first campaign-trail question about the deadly Benghazi terror attacks in 2012 . DEADLY: The September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attacks killed four Americans including the US ambassador to Libya . WRONG: Both President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Clinton incorrectly blamed the Benghazi attacks on protests sparked by a YouTube video mocking Islam's prophet Muhammad. The two are shown at a ceremony held to receive the remains of the four Americans who were killed at the scene . Moments earlier, she answered a question about why her taxpayer-funded security detail had sped at 80 MPH past exits for the smaller Manchester, New Hampshire airport, and trekked all the way to Boston for a flight with first class seats. 'You know, I don't make the travel arrangements. I don't,' Clinton said. The Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah's military-style Benghazi attacks will likely be a thorn in Clinton's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign season. The group laid waste to a State Department facility while she was America's top diplomat. A special congressional committee chaired by South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, has a mandate to investigate the episode through January 2017, making it unlikely that Clinton will be able to put the issue behind her. TROUBLE AHEAD: New Hampshire resident Brian Blackden included 'Benghazi blood' Tuesday on a sign listing reasons 'Hillary is a liar,' near the site of a Clinton appearance at the New Hampshire Technical Institute . On Sunday during a series of 50 brief interviews with Dartmouth College students in Hanover, New Hampshire, 22 of them made references to Bengahzi when asked about Clinton's chances of becoming president. Many of them, like freshman Cameron Poole, weren't old enough to drive when it happened. 'I think there was blood on her hands,' Poole told Daily Mail Online. He said he believes Clinton's performance before, during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office. 'I definitely do,' he said. 'It shows how she acts under pressure.' NOT FORGOTTEN: U.S. Ambassader the Libya Chris Stevens was the first to die in Benghazi, and was seen by Libyans as a moderate – angering anti-American hardliners from radical Islamist groups .

"Gareth Bale hit the post with an effort from around 50 yards out during Real Madrid's 1-0 defeat by Athletic Bilbao on Saturday evening but the question is: Did he mean it? With the Spanish giants trailing 1-0 at San Mames, the Welshman produced what looked like an audacious repeat of David Beckham's famous lob for Manchester United against Wimbledon back in 1996. The ball flew through the air and caught Bilbao goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz completely off guard before dipping and smacking the post; much to the disappointment of Javier Hernandez who raised his arms to celebrate before being beaten to the rebound by a defender.

Bale shoots at goal during a disappointing day for Carlo Ancelotti's side who may have surrended top spot . The shot soon caused debate among fans on social media with some reckoning the kick was a cross which went horribly awry rather than a direct effort at goal. Whether Bale meant it or not, had the ball sailed in it would surely have been up there with some of the wideman's finest strikes. Beckham's successful attempt from such a distance is one of the finest, most memorable goals of the Premier League era. Aged just 21, Beckham received the ball in his own half and spotted Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan off his line before producing a stunning strike from the halfway line which flew perfectly into the back of the net. Meanwhile, defeat for Carlo Ancelotti's side on Saturday means Barcelona can leapfrog Los Blancos at the top of the La Liga table with a win over Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.

"Los Angeles (CNN)Gov. Jerry Brown unveiled an emergency $1 billion spending plan Thursday to tackle the state's historic drought. A staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for California to recover from the emergency. Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León said the legislation will include two bills that will speed up contracting funds to ""manage the drought and strengthen our infrastructure."" According to the California State Water Resources Control Board, the package will specifically accelerate $128 million from the governor's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities. Proposition 1 funding, which enacted the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, will funnel $272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure. Some $660 million from Prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas. As part of the changes, Brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as California enters the fourth year of a worsening-water crisis. ""This unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up,"" said Brown. ""But we have a lot of good policies coming."" To exacerbate matters, weather conditions are continuing to diminish natural resources. The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which Californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs, is at a near record low. The March snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow, just 5% of the March 3 historical average for the measurement site. The overall water content for the Northern Sierra snowpack came in at 4.4 inches, just 16% of average for the date. Central and southern Sierra readings were 5.5 inches (20% of average) and 5 inches (22% of average) respectively. Only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower. ""The drought isn't letting up, so we can't let up either,"" Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins said. ""This legislation will deliver relief to Californians harmed by the drought and help us manage the significant problems the drought continues to cause. Since our skies are still clear, our job is too. And making sure we meet emergency needs, prepare for short term problems and advance longer-term projects are an important part of that effort."" Brown anticipates his emergency package to move into action immediately. He has recently created a Drought Task Force to expedite the legislation.

"It might be one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar but some of the arrivals at Cheltenham Festival today appeared to have dressed for the club rather than the parade ring. Although rural staples such as tweed, fur and Hunter wellies were present and correct, other race goers opted to take advantage of the bright Gloucestershire sunshine and stepped out in wool mini skirts, worn with knee-length boots. Print also proved a hit, with one brave lady choosing a cheerful ensemble comprised of a leopard print bag combined with a matching coat, boots and tights, while another opted for head-to-toe zebra print.

But it is allegedly his sons Burt, Brandon and Brody Jenner and stepdaughter Kim Kardashian who are hesitant to hear and watch just how much their 65-year-old patriarch will reveal about gender change.

"(CNN)Italian fashion designer Stefano Gabbana and Elton John are in a war of words on social media, calling for boycotts of each other's work. The argument stems from comments about in-vitro fertilization in Panorama magazine, in which Gabbana and longtime collaborator Domenico Dolce spoke about ""synthetic"" children born from ""rented"" wombs. ""No chemical children: life has a natural course, there are things that shouldn't be modified,"" the magazine says in a quote attributed to both designers. The magazine also promises insights from the designers on ""the importance of relationships within conventional families with very, very traditional values"" in an interview that hit Italian newsstands last week. John, who has two children with husband David Furnish through IVF, issued a strong repudiation of the statements on Sunday and pledged to boycott the Dolce & Gabbana fashion line. In response, Gabbana defended his ""freedom to speak"" and called on fans to boycott John. Sir Elton appears to be winning the social media war with the hashtag #BoycottDolceGabbana, which by Monday morning had been used more than 35,000 times on Twitter since John invoked it on Sunday. By comparison, Gabbana's #boycotteltonjohn has been used just 1,600 times on Twitter, according to social media search tool Topsy. ""How dare you refer to my beautiful children as 'synthetic'. And shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at IVF - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfill their dream of having children,"" John said Sunday on Instagram. ""Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again."" The sentiment quickly gathered support from such celebrities as Ricky Martin, Al Roker and Courtney Love. Tennis star Martina Navratilova tweeted her support for John's post, saying ""My D&G shirts are going in the bin — don't want ANYONE to wear them."" Parents and IVF advocates also joined the boycott. ""My son is NOT synthetic. His life was made possible through #IVF & I couldn't be more grateful,"" writer and infertility advocate Jenn Palumbo said in a tweet. The comments from Dolce and Gabbana struck some as hypocritical coming from a couple that was romantically involved until 2005 (they continued working together after the breakup). Still, Gabbana has dropped hints in interviews of his ""traditional"" views toward family structure. He told an Italian publication in 2006 that he once asked a female friend to be a surrogate mother because he was ""opposed to the idea of a child growing up with two gay parents."" Gabbana was quick to react to this controversy, calling John a ""fascist"" in an Instagram comment that was later deleted, according to CNN affiliate TGCom24. He also sought to discredit reports that they told Panorama in this instance they objected to same-sex adoption, even though Gabbana took that position in his 2006 interview. By Sunday evening, Gabbana's Instagram feed was full of screengrabs and reposts from people who supported his right to voice his opinion. ""It's a shame that you are not allowed to

"A former special education high school teacher who admitted to having sex with five underage male students has been sentenced to three years in state prison. Summer Michelle Hansen, 32, of California entered a guilty plea in February to 16 felony counts related to the sex acts which included seven counts of oral copulation of a minor, six counts of statutory rape and three counts of distributing pornographic material to a child, according to NBC. The mother of three was told during the sentencing on Friday that she must also register as a sex offender for life.

Parents of the victims were disappointed that the judge approved Hansen's plea agreement, as she could have faced 13 years in prison if convicted at trial . Hansen entered a guilty plea in February to the 16 felony counts related to sex acts with her five male students . Judge Dugan said she took into consideration factors such as the former teacher's admittance of guilt and lack of prior criminal history when deciding on an appropriate sentence. In court on Friday, the judge told Hansen: 'You're a mother yourself. It's beyond me to understand your behavior.'

Hansen made an emotional plea to the victims' families while in court saying she prayed for them every night and that she was 'heartbroken', according to KTLA. 'I'm not a monster. I made bad choices in life and for that I'm truly, truly sorry,' Hansen said through tears. The ex-teacher came under investigation two years ago after a former student at Centennial High School came forward to say he had sex with Hansen, and she was arrested in June 2013. Prosecutors said the crimes took place in her classroom, a school utility room, her car and at one victim's home between May 2012 and 2013, according to KTLA.

"Murdered preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani (above) was killed by a hitman who climbed into the back of his car, it emerged last night . Murdered preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani was killed by a hitman who climbed into the back of his car, it emerged last night. The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work. But when the imam arrived, the killer got into the rear seat of his Volkswagen Passat and shot him several times. The murder at 11.15am on Tuesday bears all the hallmarks of a professional assassination because the gunman was thought to have used a silencer and it took place away from CCTV cameras. Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers are investigating whether Mr Arwani, a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, was murdered on the orders of the regime. They suspect the part-time builder was tricked into driving to Wembley to quote for a job – but the killer was put off when the imam took his teenage son along and claimed he could not find the keys to the house. He is thought to have been executed when the mystery client – described as having an African accent – asked Mr Arwani to return a second time alone. Shortly after the shooting Mr Arwani's car was discovered 'perfectly parked' on the side of the road with the engine still running and with one of the windows wound down. The father-of-six from Acton, west London, had links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group outlawed in Syria and other countries in the Middle East. He is understood to have been a member of the organisation until about seven years ago, but retained ties to some of the group's senior figures.

It is thought that when the imam arrived, the killer got into his Volkswagen Passat . Mr Arwani was a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who is pictured above in September 2013 . Mr Arwani fled Syria in 1982 after a massacre in his home city of Hama carried out on the orders of Assad's father, Hafez. The imam, who moved to Britain in the mid-1990s after studying Islamic law in Jordan, claimed he was sentenced to death in his absence by the Syrian regime. He was involved in violent anti-Assad demonstrations outside the Syrian Embassy in London three years ago. Police were forced to use riot shields to beat back protesters after they broke through barriers, and six people were arrested. Mr Arwani told reporters during the demonstration: 'This building belongs to the Syrian people, not a regime killing people every single day for ten months.'

"(CNN)Can you imagine paying $1,000 a month in rent to live in a one-car garage? Nicole, a 30-year-old woman, doesn't have to imagine this scenario because it's her everyday reality. The small and unusual living space is all that this employed, single mother can afford in her high-cost community in San Mateo, California. Nicole isn't alone in her struggles. CNN recently published a powerful piece called ""Poor kids of Silicon Valley"" that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the Bay Area. One aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people, including 11 children. Another chronicles a husband and wife named Rich and Stacey, both of whom have jobs, who are living in a San Jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they don't have the money to go anywhere else. Although Silicon Valley has unique characteristics, it isn't the only community confronting these challenges. Our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. The agency I lead, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, recently released a report estimating that 7.7 million low-income households live in substandard housing, spend more than half their incomes on rent or both. These are families who are dedicating $1 out of every $2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head. And the more they spend on housing, the less they have to invest in their children's education, build up savings and shop at local businesses. These are outcomes that hurt our nation's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action. HUD is working with local partners across the country to do just that. First, we're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists. Since the mid-1970s, we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units. But by 2020, we're in danger of losing more than 125,000 because these mortgages are maturing, ending agreements to control rents in these units. So we've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come. We're also doing the same with public housing. Right now, the nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year, mainly because of disrepair, HUD created the Rental Assistance Demonstration initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good. It's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as Lexington, North Carolina, where the local housing authority is making 58 years' worth of repairs in just 22 months, including new lighting, modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs. RAD has allowed local communities to raise more than $733 million in new capital to date. That's why we're asking Congress to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program. No American should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home. In addition to preservation, HUD is also working to create new affordable housing. A

"A petty feud between the two most powerful women in Ed Miliband’s inner circle has rocked the Labour Party. The dispute between the party’s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell – who is tipped as a future Labour leader – to attend the Brits ‘pre-party’ where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.’ The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the ‘second jobs’ debate was partly the responsibility of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London’s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co’ at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics – as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party’s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November. A Labour MP said: ‘Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics. ‘We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.’ A Labour spokesman said last night: ‘There is no truth in this allegation.’

"Tragic: Paul Millgate killed himself by jumping from a window at his Bournemouth University accommodation block . A jilted student sent his ex-girlfriend a picture of himself with a noose around his neck before leaping out of a window to his death - and police had to stop people from taking photos of his body, an inquest heard. Paul Millgate, a Bournemouth University psychology student, jumped out of the window of his accommodation block after falling into despair when his 16-month relationship ended. Suicide notes were found in the student's room and he had previously asked fellow residents if he should kill himself. Mr Millgate, 20, of Crowborough, East Sussex, died of devastating multiple injuries from the fall - just days after breaking up with Aleasha Istead. Before his death, he messaged Ms Istead saying 'my life is not worth living' before sending pictures taken from the window that he jumped from. He had started drinking heavily in the days leading up to his death and leapt from the building while flatmates were having a party in another room. Witnesses said his body was visible from many of the 400 flats in the halls of residence. The windows in the building are designed to only open at a tilt. But an inquest at Bournemouth Coroner's Court heard that the window's lock had been over-ridden by a previous resident who bought a special key from the internet to open it fully. Coroner Mr Payne reached a verdict of suicide. He said: 'It is my conclusion that he did deliberately take himself out of the window and sadly ended up on the ground below having jumped from the 10th floor. 'This could never have been a cry for help. He must have realised that by jumping out of there, there was only one result and that would have been his death.' A police officer who responded to the incident spoke of her shock at having to try to stop university students taking photos, the inquest heard. PC Emily Rowberry said she was confronted by lots of students looking out of their windows taking photos and videos of the 20-year-old's body and expressed fears they would appear on social media before his family were informed of his death. In a statement read out at the inquest, PC Rowberry said: 'He was pronounced dead at 00.28am. Window tampered with: An inquest heard that the window's lock (appartment block pictured, left) had been over-ridden by a previous resident who bought a special key from the internet to open it fully . 'The location was very prominent. I was concerned for the onlookers' wellbeing and the casualty's dignity. I could see a lot of people were watching from their windows. 'I shouted for people to move away from the windows and close their curtains. I was shocked to see cameras flashing as people then took pictures and video. 'I was worried pictures might appear on social media before we had time to inform the family so I shouted again for people to go inside.' Mr Millgate had been

"It seems like an idyllic smattering, with nothing more to worry about than sun, sea, sand and where the next cocktail is coming from. But one organisation is asking tourists to investigate before heading to the exclusive holiday destination to ensure they are not visiting a resort associated with human rights abuses. Known for pristine beaches and crystal clear water, the Maldives has recently come under scrutiny after the country's former president, Mohammad Nasheed, was found guilty of terrorism charges earlier this year. Ethical Maldives Alliance is encouraging tourists to boycott 'high risk' resorts linked to human rights abuses . Now, the Ethical Maldives Alliance is encouraging tourists to consider the instability in the region when booking their accommodation. The Alliance has crafted a list of over 100 well-known hotels and is urging visitors to consult the guide before travelling. Although very little detail is provided when it comes to the Alliance's rationale for dubbing certain resorts to be 'high risk,' it has colour-coded the hotels into three categories. Those to be avoided are labelled red, those coded as green are considered to be 'low risk' and orange hued businesses are 'under consideration.' 'While okay to visit in the short term, there is a possibility that they will be on the 'to avoid' list in the longer term,' the website reads. 'Therefore, early reservations for visits later in the year should be avoided.' The group claims that the 'red' or 'orange' resorts are directly or indirectly linked to human rights abuses. Hotels are coded as 'low risk,' 'high risk, or 'under consideration' depending on their ties to corruption . By boycotting, the alliance hopes that tourists will help to make a difference in protecting and promoting democracy, while not adversely effecting the Maldivian economy. 'With a long and sad history of corruption, political oppression and human rights abuses, Maldives' first attempts at democratic reform are now faltering,' a statement on the Alliance's website reads. Crime is reportedly on the rise as a result of support for 'extreme gangs,' which are supported by police to suppress any dissent. 'Uncontrolled corruption starting at the very top of all branches of government filters down through all levels of society, making life very difficult for the average Maldivian.' Though most resorts are categorised as 'low risk,' Conrad Maldives Rangali Island is listed as one to avoid . While most resorts are categorised as 'low risk,' several top name hotels have been included on the Alliance's list of those to avoid. Among them, the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island. 'Ethical Maldives evaluates resorts and other businesses on ethics-based criteria,' the website reads. 'These include owners' support for governments that perpetuate corruption, intimidation and oppression, measures relevant to the environment and social responsibility.' In response to allegations presented by The Ethical Maldives Association, the High Commission of the Maldives told MailOnline Travel: 'Resorts appear to be categorised not on the basis of any practices in their resorts, but on the basis of alleged links of their owners to the Government of the Maldives. 'With only two resort groups targeted

"Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms and that the implementing of a Rooney Rule could help raise awareness of the issue. Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, has been vocal on racism in football in the past and supports John Barnes’s assertion that black managers find it difficult to get another job after being sacked. ‘Just because I’m sitting here I’m not going to change my views of many years,’ said Ramsey, who takes his side to West Brom in search of a much-needed three points on Saturday. Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms . Ramsey believes that the implementing of a Rooney Rule could help raise awareness of the 'covert' issue . John Barnes’ view that black managers find it hard to get a job after being sacked was backed up by Ramsey . ‘The fact we’re still, at this stage of the game, highlighting that I’m the only black Premier League manager shows that it’s not the norm to have people from ethnic minorities in this position. ‘So until this becomes normal, and it’s not highlighted in such a spectacular fashion, racism will be prominent. ‘Obviously, I’m in a very fortunate position to be the manager of QPR but I hope people won’t look at that as a token gesture. I think I’ve earned my stripes to be in this position. Barnes' last managerial job was at Tranmere in 2009. He lasted four months before being sacked . Ramsey is operating as the only black manager in the Premier League as he looks to keep QPR up . Ramsey was without a job for seven months after leaving his coaching role at Tottenham last season . ‘I think that there are other people who are probably more talented or better suited, from a profile point of view, as many white managers who have got jobs based on their profile and playing experience.’ The 52-year-old manager thinks that discrimination isn’t exclusive to race and that the Rooney Rule — which obliges America’s NFL teams to interview minority candidates for top jobs — might be the solution here. ‘If it doesn’t work out for me here, I think that, as any manager of any race, I think you’re always in a position where it’s difficult to get another job,’ he said. QPR travel to face West Bromwich Albion after disappointingly losing at home to Everton last time out . Aaron Lennon is congratulated by his team-mates at Loftus Road as the QPR players head for the half-way line . ‘As a black man, I think it’s always going to be difficult anyway. I think the Rooney Rule is an important factor as there’s an awareness that something has to be done to affect the way people think in boardrooms. ‘I’m not just talking about race, I’m talking about gender, homophobia and other issues. I think there needs to be more awareness of factors that affect why people get jobs or not.’

"A team of scientists claim it has found a way to inject people’s eyes with ‘night vision’. The research gave one volunteer the ability to see more than 164ft (50 metres) in almost total darkness for 'several hours'. By injecting his eyes with a liquid solution, he could spot people running among trees in dark conditions 100 per cent of the time, while others who hadn't been treated with the drops were successful in only a third of cases. Californian researchers have developed a liquid that enables night vision. The solution combines Chlorin e6 (Ce6) with insulin and saline. A small amount of it was dripped it into a researcher's eyes. It briefly turns the eyes dark or black before it is absorbed, seen in this image of researcher Gabriel Licina . The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called ‘biohackers’ in California called Science for the Masses. They used a solution of a substance called Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which is found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also been used in cancer treatment research. Combining Ce6 with insulin and saline, the team produced a solution that can increase vision in low light conditions. In April, researchers revealed a super-thin infrared light sensor, which could become an invaluable tool for the soldiers of the future as researchers work to develop the advance into night vision contact lenses. Created by University of Michigan researchers Ted Norris and Zhaohui Zhong, the sensor uses an atom-thin material called graphene which could be layered onto contact lenses. Graphene takes infrared rays and translates them into electrical signals. The process is similar to the way silicon chip in a digital camera work with visible light, Wired reported. 'If we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics, it expands your vision,' Zhong said. 'It provides you another way of interacting with your environment.' They note in their paper, though, that ‘the high risk of cellular toxicity from outside contaminants being absorbed through the skin make this chemical something that should only be handled with caution.’ As a result it is not advisable for people to carry out the procedure themselves at home. Russell Peake, Eye Health Condition Manager at Boots Opticians, told MailOnline that people should not attempt to recreate the experiment. 'Unless a solution has been prescribed or recommended by an optometrist, GP or pharmacist, people should not be inserting anything into their eyes,' he warned. 'An invasive eye procedure should only ever be undertaken by a trained expert in a clinical environment, as wrong use could lead to disruption or damage of the eye’s surface or tears, potentially leading to vision loss. 'Whilst the idea of ""night vision eye drops"" may seem interesting, this appears to be an unlicensed and unproven solution that has no medical approval. 'We would strongly advise against anyone trying this at home as the risks could potentially be very damaging and would advise people speak to their local optician for further information or advice.' The experiment was carried out by a group

"It was only fitting that a former Hearts man should help to finally send the Championship title to Tynecastle. After all, this entire season deserves to be coloured maroon. Yet it was not only a favour to his first love that Lee Wallace performed at Easter Road. In scoring the crucial, confidence-building opening goal for Rangers, he also delivered an immensely valuable prize to his current employers. For the Ibrox side, games against Hibernian this term have been akin to a sadistically extended form of torture. Three successive defeats had delivered a crushing 9-1 aggregate. One more on Sunday and it was an historic clean sweep. It would also have delayed Hearts’ inevitable coronation for at least another six days. Lee Wallace (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after giving Rangers the lead away to Hibernian . Hibernian XI: Oxley, Gray (Watson - 45), Hanlon, Fontaine. Stevenson, Fyvie, Robertson (Stanton - 78), MGeouch, Allan, Malonga, Dja Djedje (Boyle - 69) Subs not used: Forster, Craig, Handling, Perntreou . Booked: Gray . Rangers XI: Bell, McGregor, McCulloch, Mohsni, Zaliukas, Wallace; Murdoch, Law, Shiels (Black - 75); Clark, Miller (Vuckic - 83) Subs not used: Robinson, Hutton, Black, Daly, Templeton, Sinnamon . Goals: Wallace 44, Miller 80 . Booked: Murdoch, Miller . Wallace, though, had different ideas. Freed to attack almost at will in a new 3-5-2 formation set up by Stuart McCall, he delivered a barnstorming display on the left flank. After speaking so openly on Friday about how this had been a season of professional and personal torment, here was an emphatic reminder of just how forceful a player he can be. Others in blue followed his lead. Kenny Miller scored a highly controversial clincher ten minutes from the end — when refereeing headline-magnet Willie Collum ignored Hibs’ claims for a foul by Wallace — but, in truth, this was a victory that had foundations laid long before kick-off. So often in recent times, Rangers fans have lamented the perceived lack of tactical thinking from those resident in the technical area. McCall, though, turned up in Leith and did a number on Hibs to secure the first triumph of his three-match reign. It did not go unnoticed. Kenny Miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for Rangers and close the gap on Hibernian . ‘Stuart McCall’s blue-and-white army’ was the chant from the visiting support as the minutes ticked down. McCall’s hopes of remaining in situ beyond the end of the season may well hinge on winning promotion. If that is to become a reality, then he will need many more days like this one. Overall, this was just a second win in 10 games for Rangers but it lifted them to within three points of their hosts, with a game in hand. They now have renewed hope of finishing second and reducing their play-off schedule in the fight to follow Hearts up. Hibs’ 15-match unbeaten run is at an end but Stubbs is adamant this will not derail the momentum they have steadily built since the turn of the

The report outlines the Liberal Party's unprofessional questions toward women about their personal lives during the preselection process . 'How were they going to balance family and political life?' and 'Who would cook the meals?' were some of the questions asked according to the report. It also mentioned a number of occasions that 'involved party members in limited areas engaging in intimidation, threatening and bullying behaviours towards female party members and members of Parliament,' The Age reported. The report made 14 recommendations, including stepping up general participation of women and increasing the number of females in the party. Upper house Mary Wooldridge reportedly noted that the Liberal party has lost female voters. 'We've gone from a party where women clearly vote for us, to one where they clearly do not,' she said.

"The new Republican governor of Illinois has said New Jersey is 'going down the drain' - despite it being run by fellow Republican Chris Christie, who sent $7million his way in the latest election campaign. Bruce Rauner said the Garden State was 'lost', thanks in part to its high property taxes. Rauner hit out at New Jersey, which has had Christie as governor since 2010, during a speech at the Illinois Farm Bureau last week. Sniping: Bruce Rauner, right, has said that New Jersey, the state run by his ally Chris Christie, left, is 'a disaster' because of its tax regime . Rauner's backer: Christie's Republican Governors Association gave $7million to Rauner's campaign in the 2014 governor elections . He said: 'We've got the highest property taxes in America other than New Jersey. I don't want to compete with New Jersey on anything, especially that. That's a disaster.' The State Register-Journal of Springfield, Illinois, reported that he continued: 'New Jersey is lost. They're going down the drain, and they ain't turning it around.' The staunch criticism may come as a surprise to Christie, who as the head of the Republican Governors Association funneled $7million in campaign funds to help him topple Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn. Christie often showed up on the campaign trail alongside Rauner, and boasted that he 'didn't come empty-handed' after making a $2.5million top-up to the coffers. He's behind you: Rauner, left, stands behind Christie during a Chicago fundraiser in which the two ate jumbo hotdogs . CBS Chicago reported how during the campaign Rauner and Christie made a public appearance to order jumbo hotdogs together before a hotel fundraiser. In return, Rauner has often been a vocal Christie fan. NJ.com reports that he has described him as 'one of the greatest public servants in America today' and 'a superstar'. Rauner spent a total of $37million on TV ads alone in the campaign, in which he outspent Quinn by some $9million, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The Center's records from the 2014 governor elections show Christie's association sent a total of $7million Rauner's way. Spokesmen for Christie and Rauner have yet to comment.

"The Pentagon said Tuesday it would exhume and try to identify the remains of nearly 400 sailors and Marines killed when the USS Oklahoma sank in the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The ship capsized after being hit by nine torpedoes during the December 7, 1941 surprise attack from Japanese forces. Altogether, 429 sailors and Marines onboard were killed. Only 35 were identified in the years immediately after. Hundreds were buried as unknowns at cemeteries in Hawaii. In 1950, they were reburied as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific - also known as the Punchbowl - inside a volcanic crater in Honolulu. Scroll down for video . Casualties: The Pentagon announced Tuesday plans to exhume the bodies of some 400 sailors and Marines who were killed on the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941, in the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor. Above, the ship seen capsized after the attack . Resting place: The sailors and Marines who died on board the USS Oklahoma are currently buried as unknowns in Honolulu's National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific . Nameless: Above, a gravestone at Honolulu's National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, marking the resting place of seven unknown Americans who died on board the USS Oklahoma . The military is acting now, nearly 75 years after the men died, because advances in forensic science and technology as well as genealogical help from family members have made it possible to identify more remains, said Lt. Col. Melinda Morgan, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency spokeswoman. The move is apparently a part of a new Pentagon policy on disinterring the remains of unknown troops. According to the new policy, bodies may be exhumed from Punchbowl or any other permanent American military cemeteries - but they can not be removed from any U.S. Navy vessel that is being used as a national memorial, like the USS Arizona which remains sunk and on display in Honolulu. The bodies of Marines and sailors lost at sea do not apply to this new effort. In order to disinter these large groups, researchers must also prove that they can identify at least 60 per cent of the group with supplied family DNA samples, medical and dental records. 'The secretary of defense and I will work tirelessly to ensure your loved one's remains will be recovered, identified, and returned to you as expeditiously as possible, and we will do so with dignity, respect and care,' Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work said in a statement. 'While not all families will receive an individual identification, we will strive to provide resolution to as many families as possible.' Officials plan to begin the work in three to six weeks, Morgan said. They aim to identify the remains of up to 388 servicemen within five years. In 2003, the military disinterred one casket at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific based on information provided by Ray Emory, a Pearl Harbor survivor who has spent years doggedly scouring documents.

"Quick-thinking: Brady Olson, a teacher at North Thurston High, took down a gunman on Monday . A Washington high school teacher is being hailed a hero for tackling a 16-year-old student to the ground after he opened fire on Monday morning. No one was injured after the boy shot twice toward the ceiling in the school commons before classes began at North Thurston High School in Lacey, about 60 miles southwest of Seattle, authorities said. Brady Olson, who teaches Advanced Placement government and civics at the school, knocked the armed student to the ground and kept him pinned down until authorities arrived, witnesses said. The shooter is in custody at the Lacey Police Station. The teenager, who has not been identified, only transferred to the high school a month ago, according to authorities. He later told police he shot into the air because he didn't want to hurt anyone. A search warrant is being carried out at his home, police said. School district spokesperson Courtney Schrieve confirmed that the 43-year-old teacher had been responsible for helping apprehend the student. 'He is a very brave man who probably saved a lot of people today,' Schrieve told KCPQ. Both students and staff said they were not surprised that Olson, who has taught at the school for nine years, was the one to stop the shooter. 'If anyone in the school were to do something like he did, I would think it would be him,' said student Teia Patan, 17, who is in one of Olson's classes. 'He's one of those people who watch over kids.' Scene: A 16-year-old student walked into the commons, pictured, on Monday with a gun and cigarette and fired two shots at the ceiling, according to witnesses. Mr Olson then tackled the boy to the ground . Fears: Parents and students walk away from North Thurston High School on Monday after a 16-year-old student opened fire before classes at the school and was stopped by a teacher . Patan was swept into a classroom and then escorted out of the building after the shooting. He described his high school as a nice, calm school, with no bullying. 'When it was happening, I first thought it has to be fake,' he added. Another student, 16-year-old Anthony Rybalkin, told the News Tribune that he was in the commons area when the shots were fired. 'I saw (the student) walking down the stairs with a cigarette and gun in his hand,' Rybalkin said. 'I was like, ""This is actually happening"".' He watched as Olson tackled the boy to the ground. He said that another teacher then helped him hold the teenager down. Olson, who is married to an elementary teacher in the school district, Shara Olson, has been teaching for nearly 20 years and has also worked as a former assistant football coach. Scene: No one at the school (pictured) was injured thanks to the quick-thinking of the popular teacher .

"Solitary: Steve Fuller has worked as the winter caretaker of Yellowstone National Park since 1973 . Steve Fuller has lived in New York, San Francisco and London, but the place he decided to settle down is about the opposite of any booming metropolis. For the past 42 years, Fuller has worked as the caretaker of Yellowstone National Park, protecting the park's buildings during the long and brutal winter months. He lives in a small cabin alone during the winter, with enough food stored up since his closest neighbors are a two-hour snowmobile ride away. It sounds like the premise of Stephen King's thriller The Shining, but Fuller claims he's never felt lonely or the least bit antsy cooped up alone in his cabin. 'Never had cabin fever. Never been bored,' the 70-something outdoorsman told CBS. That's because there's plenty of work to keep Fuller busy. Winter preparation starts in November, when he works with a crew to board up his share of the parks about 100 buildings. Then, once everyone is gone, he waits for the snow to come - and it never disappoints. Yellowstone averages about 150 inches of snowfall a year and Fuller has to stop it from accumulating on the roofs of the park's buildings, which can collapse under the weight of the snow. Over the years, Fuller has developed a system which takes some of the hassle out of shoveling the roofs. Instead, he uses a saw to cut the snow into blocks which he then pushes off the roof with the help of gravity. Fuller has been doing the job since 1973, when he was the only applicant and the pay was just $13.24 a day. Over the years, Fuller's responsibilities have grown and now he is one of the only Yellowstone staffers who work at the park year round. Scroll down for video . Content: In the winter, Fuller stays behind to take care of his section of the park. But he says he never gets lonely . Tough work: During the day, Fuller works to keep about 100 buildings free from snow, since they can collapse under the several feet that accumulate every year. He has developed a method of sawing the snow into blocks and pushing them off the roof, which makes the job a little easier . The cold months: The winter care-taking job starts at the beginning of November and ends whenever plows can reach the park. Above a group of bison seen in a snow-covered Yellowstone field . Winter home: This small 100-year-old cabin is where Fuller calls home. he packs it with just enough food to last the winter . While most caretakers only last a few years in the job, Fuller continues because he's comfortable with the solitude and has the right interests to make the job fun. Amazingly, Fuller has no TV in his small cabin, which he estimates is about 100 years old. Instead, he gets his news by tuning into Wyoming Public Radio and entertains himself with his vast library of books. He also spends a

"Leeds striker Steve Morison admits he has never experienced anything like the current circus surrounding the SkyBet Championship side. Six players - Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri, Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani - withdrew from the squad on the eve of Saturday's trip to Charlton citing injuries, and this is just the latest incident in another turbulent period at Elland Road. A 'freakish set of events' was how beleaguered boss Neil Redfearn described the sextet's absence after the game but Morison, who scored Leeds' goal in the 2-1 defeat at The Valley, told BBC West Yorkshire Sport: 'We're around it every day. Leeds United striker Steve Morison (centre) admits he is surprised by the chaos at Elland Road at the moment . Giuseppe Bellusci and three other Italians were among those who withdrew form the Leeds squad . Souleymane Doukara was another player that withdrew as part of the latest drama at Elland Road . 'People draw their own conclusions over what happened (with the withdrawals). It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.' When asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened. 'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit. 'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.' Former Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club. Italian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. According to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday. But Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road. 'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek. 'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.

Most responded that the sharks looked like either Blacktips or Spinners, which migrate this time of year to breed. The picture had been shared more than 2,000 times by Sunday.

"The Secret Service took more than a year to replace a broken alarm system at the home of George H.W. Bush, it has emerged. The alarm failed at the former president's Houston residence in September 2013 and even though the Secret Service bought a replacement system in January 2014, it took until December for it to be installed - leaving the couple without the protection of a working alarm at their home for 15 months. It came despite an agent's recommendation in 2010 that the alarm, which was installed in 1993, be replaced because it 'had exceeded its life cycle'. The request was denied for an unknown reason. The oversight - just the latest in a string of blunders by the agency - was revealed in a report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, which was released on Thursday. Concerns: Former First Lady Barbara Bush and former President George H.W. Bush, pictured watching basketball in March, did not have a working alarm at their Houston home for more than a year . During the time the alarm was out of service, the Secret Service assigned an employee to keep watch over the residence, according to the report,CBS News reported. Some inside the agency contended that the agent was not sufficient to replace the alarm system, the Washington Post reported. Despite the apparently relaxed security measures, there were no breaches at the property, where 90-year-old Bush and his wife Barbara have lived for more than two decades. On Twitter on Thursday, Bush said that he and his wife have 'great respect for, and confidence in, the men and women' of the Secret Service. 'That respect and confidence has never waned,' he wrote. Endorsement: In light of the reports, Bush tweeted that he had 'great respect' for the Secret Service . Property: Their Houston home, circle, was guarded by a Secret Service agent throughout the 15 months . The report also raises concerns about the security at other former presidents' homes, but has redacted their names. Among the concerns, one official reported that safety equipment showed 'signs of impending failure'. In January, the Washington Post reported that the alarm system at Vice President Joe Biden's home was failing so agents had simply switched the system off. They were told that budget constraints meant the repairs would have to wait. The new report, which was addressed to Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy, recommended that the agency reviews all security equipment and looks into how it keeps track of maintenance issues. 'With these fixes in place, we believe the Secret Service will more effectively meet its mission to protect the lives and homes of our former presidents,' Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth, who wrote the report, said in a statement.

"Union barons handed Ed Miliband more than £1.6million in the first week of the election campaign – treble the donations received by the Tories. Figures released by the Electoral Commission revealed that Labour received £1.9million in the week to April 5, with 84 per cent coming from just three trade unions. It included a £1million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour’s reliance on the union’s militant boss Len McCluskey. Ed Miliband received £1.6m from union barons in the first week of the election campaign, figures have revealed . Conservative donations totalled just over £500,000 in the first week of the campaign, with about a quarter coming from donors with links to hedge funds. Critics have accused Labour of being bound by its union paymasters after the party unveiled policies including raising corporation tax, introducing a mansion tax, repealing the benefits cap, nationalising the railways and scrapping employment tribunal fees. Since Mr Miliband became party leader, thanks largely to union backing, nearly £7 in every £10 donated to Labour has come from the unions – amounting to more than £40million. In the first round of election donations registered, £506,240 was given by Unison, while the CWU gave £51,072. Labour received a £1million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour’s reliance on the union’s militant boss Len McCluskey (pictured) The party did attract one large business donation, from property tycoon Sir David Garrard. The former tax exile, who was involved in the cash-for-honours controversy, gave £250,000. Ukip received only £35,416 in the period but last night its coffers were boosted by a £1million donation from Daily Express owner Richard Desmond, who gave £300,000 last year. In the week to April 5, the Conservatives received £501,850 and the Lib Dems £20,000. One of the most generous gifts to the Tories – £75,000 – came from Michael Tory, who was in charge of Lehman Brothers’ UK investment banking division when the bank nearly crashed the West’s economy. Sawsan Asfari, wife of long-time Tory donor and oil executive Ayman Asfari, gave £20,000. Syrian-born Mr Asfari, who has given the Tories about £400,000, was made a ‘business ambassador’ by David Cameron last year. Home insurance boss Richard Harpin of Homeserve gave £50,000. His company was fined £30million last year for a mis-selling scandal. Hedge fund manager, James Diner, who once dated model Caprice, gave £25,000 while socialite Fitriani Hay, who co-owns property development firm JMP Group with her racehorse-owning husband James, donated £66,850. Ukip received £25,000 from Robin Birley, who is also bankrolling Tory chief whip Michael Gove’s re-election campaign. Nick Clegg’s friend Anthony Ullmann, boss of polyester yarn company Autofil, and Joseph Zammit-Lucia, who describes himself as a ‘compulsive contrarian’ on his website, each gave £10,000 to the Lib Dems. Tory candidate Henry Smith said: ‘The union fatcats have once again lavished the dosh on Ed Miliband. That’s because they know he’s a weak leader who’ll dance to more than one tune: not only SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon’s, but their’s too. Those tunes mean more spending, more borrowing and Britain back to bankruptcy.’ Conservative donations totalled just over £500,000 in

"(CNN)One person died and another was severely injured after a cliff collapsed on the Pacific Coast north of San Francisco, the National Park Service said. The two people fell about 70 feet (21 meters) Saturday when part of the Arch Rock overlook at Point Reyes National Seashore gave way. The day before the collapse, the Point Reyes National Seashore had posted a photo on Facebook of a fissure in the rock structure -- with a warning to use caution. ""Visitors using Bear Valley Trail to Arch Rock -- watch out! At the very end of the trail, the cliff is breaking away -- seen here in a photo taken Wednesday,"" the government organization said. The NPS said hazardous conditions had been reported to it on March 19. John Dell'Osso from the Point Reyes National Seashore told CNN that it had posted warnings after being notified last Thursday that a crack had formed in the arch. ""We posted all kinds of notices up and down that particular trail, which is how probably how 99% of the people who would hike that far would (go), and all around our visitors' center in Trail Heads, just to warn people of the hazard that was out there,"" Dell'Osso said. ""We didn't know what could happen and what unfortunately did happen is on Saturday afternoon a large portion of that overlook actually collapsed down onto the beach and partly onto the ocean,"" he said. ""The tragedy is that there were two people that were standing out there who fell with all of that rubble."" On Monday, the Marin County Sheriff's Office named the deceased as 58-year-old Nancy Blum, from California. It said she had been hiking about 6:30 p.m. Saturday ""when a structural collapse of the rock occurred."" After emergency personnel reached Blum and her hiking companion, she was flown to Bear Valley Ranger Station, where she was pronounced dead. The National Park Service and the county coroner's office are investigating the cause of Blum's death. ""The cause of death will be pending the completion of toxicology studies,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. Bluffs along the California coast are known for being unstable, according to the park service. The Arch Rock trail that runs along that part of the coast has been closed until further notice. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.

"A travel writer and mother who embarked on a mammoth adventure around the world to battle the 'inner emptiness' she felt after giving birth to her son says her exploration gave her the opportunity to connect with something larger than herself, as she wrestled with the question of what it means to be a mom. Leigh Ann Henion, from Boone, North Carolina, visited a variety of far-off and remote locations during a two-year period, which began shortly after her son’s first birthday, returning home in between each trip in order to spend time with her child and her husband. And in her memoir Phenomenal: A Hesitant Adventurer’s Search for Wonder in the Natural World, which was published on Tuesday, the mother-of-one chronicles every aspect of the physical and emotional journey, which, she explains, she began in order to experience the world's natural phenomena as a part of a spiritual quest to find herself after her son Archer, now five, was born.

Unforgettable: Leigh Ann Henion wrote about witnessing Hawaii’s still-burning volcanoes and Venezuela's intense lightning in her memoir Phenomenal: A Hesitant Adventurer’s Search for Wonder in the Natural World . Loving mother: Leigh Ann, pictured on Driftwood Beach on Jekyll Island in Georgia with her son Archer, did not spend more than two weeks at a time away from her family . 'I went through a great life transition and I didn't know to process certain parts,' the 37-year-old author tells the Daily Mail Online. Leigh Ann, who has witnessed Hawaii’s still-burning volcanoes, Venezuela's intense lightning and Sweden's aurora borealis - among her many adventures - says the birth of her son in 2009 was as 'awe-inducing and fantastical' as the natural wonders she describes in her book. But she notes that no one could have prepared her for how she would feel when she was 'thrown into this very visceral experience' of being a new mom. Leigh Ann struggled with sleep deprivation, as well as her sense of self, during the first year of Archer's life. She was only sleeping for three-hour stretches and she refused to allow anyone outside of her immediate family to watch her son for the first 14 months of his life - and even then she would only leave Archer's side for a few hours at a time. 'You know the saying: ""It takes a village to raise a child?"" I wasn’t letting the village in,' she recalls.

"A North Carolina father was acquitted of strangling to death his 4-year-old son and trying to kill his other two children after the defense successfully argued that the man's 'violent sleepwalking' was to blame for the tragedy. A jury on Wednesday decided unanimously that Joseph Anthony Mitchell is not guilty of murder and attempted murder after an expert witness said he was effectively unconscious at the time of his attacks four years ago. Jurors had asked Superior Court Judge James Roberson if they could consider a lesser verdict of manslaughter, but the judge said it was all or nothing: murder, or not guilty. Scroll down for video . Breakdown: Christine Perolini, second from left, is comforted by friends and family on Wednesday after her ex-husband, Joseph Anthony Mitchell, is found not guilty of killing their four-year-old son . Sleepwalking defense: Mitchell's attorney argued that his client (left) was not conscious of the night of September 22, 2010, when he strangled to death his 4-year-old son, Blake (right) Desperate cry: Reacting to the verdict, the grieving mother exclaimed in court: 'I failed. I couldn't save him' Devastated: Christine Perolini was so stunned by the ruling that she hyperventilated and had to be wheeled out on a stretcher . Mitchell, 50, sobbed after the shocking verdict, but made no comment as he walked out of court a free man. His ex-wife, Christine Perolini, was so stunned by the ruling that she hyperventilated and had to be wheeled out on a stretcher surrounded by her family. Reacting to the verdict, the grieving mother exclaimed in court: 'I failed. I couldn't save him [Blake].' Mitchell testified that he was in financial distress and had not been sleeping well around the time of 4-year-old Blake Mitchell's death in September 2010. Prosecutors said those financial difficulties drove Mitchell to strangle the toddler and try to kill the others. Mitchell's 13-year-old and 10-year-old children testified in court that they fought him off. But a defense expert said Mitchell's stress and lack of sleep likely resulted in 'non-REM parasomnia,' a sleep disorder whose sufferers can perform random acts unconsciously. Because of this disorder, he was incapable of exercising criminal intent, the expert said. A psychologist who testified for the prosecution after repeatedly interviewing Mitchell said he had no mental condition that would have left him unconscious during the attacks, and that he must have consciously planned them. Mitchell's trial lasted a month but it took the jury less than four hours to return a not guilty verdict. Following Mitchell's acquittal, some members of the jury panel spoke out saying that they did not believe the sleepwalking defense, but their hands were tied. Prosecutors said extreme financial difficulties drove Mitchell to strangle the toddler and try to kill his two older children . Emotional: Mitchell, 50, sobbed after the shocking verdict .

"While many tattoos hold a certain symbolism to their bearer, the design chosen by someone getting their first ink at the age of 80 must have an incredibly special meaning. ABC2's new show, Tattoo Tales, follows the journey of some of the customers of Bondi Ink, a busy tattoo parlour on Sydney's Eastern beaches, including Jan Bearman, who was prompted by the death of her beloved daughter to make a decision that took the rest of her family and friends by surprise. 'Before I lost my darling Shell I wouldn't have dreamed of having a tattoo. But when something like that happens you're left grasping at straws. There's a hole left in your life and all you can do is say your prayers,' Jan told Daily Mail Australia. For the past three years, Jan Bearman has had a new tattoo inked on her shoulder every birthday in memory of her daughter Shell, who died of complications from diabetes in .

'And then I just couldn't think of a reason to not get one,' Jan said. 'Shell was just such a gorgeous girl. It's a loss that leaves a hole in your heart that's never filled again. You do these things as a memorial, to carry [her] with you,' she said. Jan said that when she announced her decision to her family, they were quite surprised but supportive the unexpected move from the now 83-year-old. 'I think they were a bit surprised but they didn't say ""don't do it"", they said ""go ahead if it will make you feel better"",' she said. 'I tried to con my other daughter into getting one too but she wasn't having any of it.' Soon after the decision had been made, Jan was spending the day with one of Shell's daughters, when they passed Bondi Ink.

"One of the earliest Spitfires ever to go into action has gone on sale for £2.5 million after spending 40 years buried in sand on the French beach it crashed on. The Mark 1 version of Reginald Mitchell's famous design was among the first built in March 1940 but Spitfire P9374, once flown by an airman involved in the Great Escape, never made it to the Battle of Britain as it crash-landed in May 1940. The fighter plane, dubbed the ballerina because of its grace in the skies, was being piloted by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk when it was hit by a single bullet from a German Dornier bomber. Before it was lost, Spitfire P9374 was at one point almost certainly flown by Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, later 'Big X', who was part of the famous breakout from German prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III.

"Beijing (CNN)China's state prosecutors on Friday formally charged the country's former security czar with accepting bribes, making him the highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges. Zhou Yongkang, 72, was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the highest prosecution authority in China, said. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems as well as prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of ""preserving social stability."" Now, prosecutors have accused Zhou of ""taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money"" during his long political career. His alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests, they added. Zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer's views were heard, according to a statement by the prosecutors. His case will be tried in Tianjin, a city near the Chinese capital, Beijing. The president of China's supreme court recently told reporters there would be ""open"" trials for accused former leaders like Zhou. However, the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in Zhou's case. Zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in October 2013. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested last December. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth, in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign, targeting both ""tigers"" and ""flies"" -- high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in Xi's dragnet to date. ""The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members,"" longtime political analyst Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said last year, when the government revealed its formal investigation into Zhou. Many observers also note Zhou's patronage of Bo Xilai, a former Communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013. Bo's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media have cited his

"Shocking CCTV footage has emerged of a British tourist shooting himself in the head in an apparent suicide at a shooting range in Thailand. The horrified reaction of a worker at the range who was supervising the man - identified as Liam Colven, originally from the Isle of Skye - can be seen as he wheels away in shock after trying to stop Mr Colven turning a handgun on himself. The footage was taken from a camera at the Thalang range on Phuket, Thailand, where the British man had arrived by taxi, reportedly following an argument with a male friend. When he hailed the taxi, he asked the driver to 'take me somewhere I can shoot', it was reported. A distressed staff member first tries to stop the man shooting himself, before wheeling away unable to believe what has just happened . Tragic: The man who shot himself has been identified as Liam Colven who was originally from the Isle of Skye . A Foreign Office spokesperson said it is 'urgently working with the authorities in Thailand to establish whether a British national has died in Phuket'. The 21-year-old used an 11mm pistol to shoot himself in the head. The incident happened at around 3pm local time when according to a staffer at the range, Mr Colven bought one package of six bullets and fired them all off at a target, reports the Phuket Gazette. He then asked for three more bullets before turning the gun on himself and firing at point blank range, staff and witnesses told police. Paying tribute to Mr Colven on Facebook last night, friend Alex Macleod said: 'There are no more words to sum up the events of today or to describe the loss and emotions of the people of Skye that has not all ready been said. 'However I consider myself lucky to be a part of a small community that I know will support the family in the days, weeks, & years to come. 'This wonderful community will also share in the loss and help each other to overcome it. RIP Liam Colven.' Jenny Mackenzie wrote: 'Love you Liam Colven sleep tight will cya one day mate x.' In the video of the incident, the staff member, wearing a light blue shirt, flings the sun hat he is wearing aside seconds after the shooting. Clearly in serious distress immediately following the man's actions, which apparently came without any sort of warning, he grips a table in shock before walking away with his hands on his head. Clearly in complete shock, the staff member who was supervising the man turns his face away in horror just seconds after he had tried to stop the British man from firing when he apparently turned the gun on himself . The man falls to the ground and strikes the floor in disbelief as he struggles to process what has just taken place . The member of staff then falls to the ground and strikes the floor in disbelief as he struggles to process what has just taken place. He

"Like many teenage girls, Madison Hurd had been dreaming of her prom all year. But a sudden infection landed the 16-year-old junior from Seward, Nebraska in the hospital, and it seemed like there was no chance she'd make it to her special night. That is, until nurses and Hurd's friends brought prom right to her bed at the Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha. After a sudden infection landed Madison Hurd, 16, in the hospital and forced her to miss her high school's prom, nurses and her friends brought the Great Gatsby-themed dance to her bed instead . Nurses spent their day off doing Hurd's nails, makeup and hair, getting music and a cake, and decorating her room with streamers and balloons . Nurses spent their day off doing Hurd's nails, makeup and hair, getting music and a cake, and decorating her room with streamers and balloons, according to Live Well Nebraska. They even made sure the decorations matched the Great Gatsby-themed dance Hurd had been planning and organizing for the last year with her student council at Milford High School. The stunning turquoise ball gown Hurd had started an after-school job to afford was laid over her hospital gown, and her boyfriend flew in from Alabama with a tux and a corsage. Hurd's mother Catrece said the nurse's efforts brought her to tears. 'It's their day off. When I think about it, I just don't know what else to say,' she told WOWT. 'They surprised us with everything. There are no words to explain and thank the staff enough about helping her have her dream night during such a stressful time in her life,' Catrece told Live Well Nebraska. Hurd's boyfriend flew in from Alabama with a tux and a corsage, and the turquoise gown the teen had gotten an after-school job to afford was laid over her hospital gown . The teen was hospitalized on Monday with what was initially thought to be a stomach bug that turned into sepsis, a life-threatening complication of an infection. Catrece said the sepsis attacked Hurd's muscles and her heart, and she has not been able to leave the hospital since. 'When we found out she was having some heart problems, that's when we knew there was no way she was going to be able to go to the prom,' she told KETV. Hurd has since been diagnosed with myocarditis, an inflammation of the middle layer of the heart wall. The teen said she was 'exhausted' but thought it was awesome that the hospital put in so much work to make her dream come true. 'I'm just very happy, very happy,' she said. 'This is better than real prom.' Hurd was hospitalized on Monday with what was initially thought to be a stomach bug and turned into sepsis, a life-threatening complication of an infection .

"Green party leader Natalie Bennett has been forced to distance herself from a bizarre online site run by her boyfriend. Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember… Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance. 'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes. When you have a teacher who kissed a 17-year-old placed on the same register as Gary Glitter it does make you wonder how useful the

"This is the unfortunate moment a twelve tonne double decker bus broke down - and was pushed to safety by the driver and a group of helpful passengers. The massive bus broke down en route to the Stagecoach depot in Dover, Kent, so the unlucky driver was forced to ask passengers, colleagues and locals to give him a helping hand. Around seven proactive members of the public and bus company workers teamed up and managed to move the heavy bus - which weighs the same as two fully-grown African elephants. The 12-tonne double decker bus (pictured) broke down on its way to the Stagecoach depot in Dover, Kent - and the unlucky driver was forced to ask passengers, colleagues and locals to give him a helping hand . The group managed to succesfully roll the huge bus - which can carry up to 80 passengers - through the streets and on to the local depot. The moment was captured by Dover resident Stephen Davies last week.

"Spring. The season that brings with it 'the sweet smell of different flowers in odor and in hue'. William Shakespeare once wrote. Try telling that to apparent cold-blooded Manchester City stars Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero, Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala, who chose to pull on their woolies for April's blockbuster Manchester derby in front of an unforgiving Old Trafford crowd; unusually late for this time of year. Admittedly temperatures in the north west on Sunday afternoon were not exactly soaring - hitting between six and eight degrees Celsius by the time of the 4pm kick off - but was it enough to wear gloves while competing as a top athlete for 90 minutes? Probably not. Yaya Toure (left) was one of four players in the Manchester derby who chose to wear gloves at Old Trafford . After another below-par game Toure was described by Gary Neville as a 'weed' in Manchester City's garden . Glove-wearing Sergio Aguero opened the scoring on derby day . It was a far from blossoming performance for the visitors as well, and like autumn leaves City fell embarrassingly to their local rivals. After a less-than-warm welcome and despite springing first at Old Trafford following an early strike from Sergio Aguero, City lacked the killer edge to overcome their adversaries. This time of year is notorious for exposing a plague of unwanted weeds in the garden, and Gary Neville knew this all too well after the clash saw his former enemies lose for the fourth time in six Premier League matches. Eliaquim Mangala looked shaky again in the Manchester City defence but at least his hands stayed warm . Argentina defender Martin Demichelis (right) slides in on Wayne Rooney during the fierce encounter . Outlook: Sprinkles. Partly sunny. Wind: 14 mph . Humidity: ↑ 93% . Temperature: 43(F) 'There are some weeds in the garden and you've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick,' Neville said of the City players - particularly Toure - in his post-match analysis. 'You cannot carry passengers.' Goals from Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling made sure under-fire boss Manuel Pellegrini would be thinking about preparing his weed killer by the end of the night. But it wasn't only the City quartet who needed the warmth... Fourth official at Old Trafford, Jonathan Moss, was also sporting a pair of hand warmers whilst introducing both sets of substitutes on Sunday. However, we'll let him off, he was only watching. Fourth official Jonathan Moss was also among those to wrap up warm at Old Trafford .

The scruffily-attired ex-footballer was seen walking arm-in-arm with on-off partner Rocio Oliva, with the blonde pictured leaning on his shoulder affectionately. Just five months ago, he was labelled a 'psychopath' after video footage emerged which appeared to show him assaulting Ms Oliva. Scroll down for video . Forgive and forget: Maradona and his on-off girlfriend Rocio Oliva, 24, were pictured strolling through Vienna on Saturday just months after she filmed him allegedly assaulting her . In the video, Maradona, who captained Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 before managing the side with less success, can be seen getting up from his sofa and approaching his Ms Oliva to berate her for using her mobile phone. Oliva filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone?' She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. Following the video's release, the former footballer played down the incident insisting he had only knocked the phone out of her hands. Scruffy attire: The 54-year-old ex-footballer looked less than smart as he walked through the Austrian capital . Backing royal: Maradona and Miss Oliva were in Vienna to meet Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein (left), who they are backing to become the next president of Fifa .

"The town of Reading may have been swept up in FA Cup euphoria, but Steve Clarke has instructed his players to approach this weekend's semi-final like any other day at work. It has been 88 years since the Royals last reached the last-four juncture and the SkyBet Championship side travel to Wembley facing the unenviable task of overcoming in-form Arsenal. Reading are striving to make the FA Cup final for the first time in their history, leading to excitement understandably building in Berkshire - if not the club's Hogwood Park training ground. Reading overcame League One side Bradford with a 3-0 replay win to progress to FA Cup semi-final . Clarke, a winner as player and coach at Chelsea, has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion, with progression the only objective. 'I think when you go through to semi-finals, the only way to enjoy it is to win the game,' the Reading manager said. 'You can't go to Wembley and play the occasion. It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal. 'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch. The Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley . 'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run. 'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.' Clarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith. One bookmaker has them at 14/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins. It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup . 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.' Reading have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final, with Pavel Pogrebnyak fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of Tuesday's 1-0 loss to table-topping Bournemouth. Steve Clarke was appointed Reading manager in December 2014 to replace Nigel Adkins . Clarke felt defeat was harsh on his side, stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter-final replay against Bradford. 'Cup competitions, one-off games, we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom, a little less nervousness, if you like,' the Royals boss said. 'I think the league campaign has been disappointing. There is sort of a feeling of doom and gloom around the league campaign this year which is never nice. Reading have struggled in the Championship but have brought FA Cup euphoria to the town with their great run

"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Thursday castigated President Barack Obama for setting a 'tone' that inspires violent behavior in America and advocated for him to emulate Bill Cosby when it comes to talking about black crime. He also told radio host John Gambling during an interview on AM 970 THE ANSWER that Obama is ignoring 'enormous amounts of crime' being committed by blacks. Roughly '70 percent' of homicides in New York City are committed by African Americans, Giuliani said. 'There are many, many extremely understandable' reasons for that both historically and environmentally, he added. 'And if an African-American president stood up and said - I hate to mention it because of what happened afterwards - the kinds of stuff that Bill Cosby used to say. The kinds of stuff that Imam Pasha says at the Malcolm X Mosque: This is our responsibility,' he said, trailing off into an explanation of Pasha's doctrine. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City, waves to public during a conference in Berlin, Germany last Saturday. Fresh off his trip abroad, Giuliani contended on Thursday that internationally, America is considered a 'racist state' Imam Izak-EL Mu'eed Pasha is a black, Muslim leader in New York who Giuliani has been friends with more than a decade. I remember Pasha saying to his congregation, if there were less crime in the community, there would be less police in our community, Giuliani recalled. When referencing Cosby, the retired New York politician was referring to allegations that surfaced last year that black actor raped or otherwise sexually assaulted number of former cast-mates and other women throughout the '60s, 70s and 80s. Prior to that 'America's Dad' had earned a reputation for forcefully encouraging African-American teens to clean up their act and make better use of the educational system their ancestors fought to earn access to. In on memorable - and controversial - address Cosby touched on the perils of stealing and defended police against charges of racism. Now known as 'the Pound Cake speech', Cosby said, 'These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake. 'Then we all run out and are outraged: ""The cops shouldn’t have shot him."" What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?' Cosby asked. 'I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else. And I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said, ""If you get caught with it, you’re going to embarrass your mother.” ' 'America's mayor' has made a few contentious statements of his own as of late, saying late last month he's not sure, based on the president's upbringing and behavior, that Obama 'loves America.' After several days of spinning, and counter claims that he had racist intent when the made the derogatory remarks about the nation's first black president, Giuliani finally ended the media-frenzy by penning an op-ed in which he explained that he simply wishes the

"These days the Cheltenham Festival is a marathon not a sprint but Willie Mullins appears to have an outstanding chance of establishing a big lead in the trainers’ title with four stellar chances on Tuesday. Sky Bet Supreme Novices’ Hurdle favourite DOUVAN (Cheltenham, 1.30) is the first of the Mullins battalion to leave the blocks before the baton is passed to powerhouses UN DE SCEAUX (Cheltenham, 2.05) in the Arkle Chase and the exciting FAUGHEEN (Cheltenham, 3.20), who boasts an outstanding chance in the Stan James Champion Hurdle. Many feel Annie Power will complete the victory parade with her coronation in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle, but she will be priced prohibitively to do so and her task may not be as straightforward as it seems after a year’s absence. Douvan is the first of Willie Mullins battalion to race at Cheltenham on Tuesday . Of the quartet, Faugheen arguably faces the most competition with last year’s winner Jezki and The New One, an unlucky third following an interrupted passage, in opposition along with National Hunt legend Hurricane Fly. However, Faugheen’s potential is as yet untapped, whereas the level his rivals have reached is known — albeit a lofty standard. The selection destroyed the opposition in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton with the form receiving a boost when third-home Blue Heron, beaten 17 lengths by Faugheen, hammered Irving at Wincanton in Grade Two company. That performance poured scorn on the theory Faugheen has beaten nothing in his unbeaten eight-race hurdling career, although it is worth noting he also boasts a 22-length mauling of Josses Hill in a Punchestown bumper and a 12-length demolition of the talented Valseur Lido on his record. Fuagheen, pictured on Monday, faces tough competition from last year's winner Jezki and The New One . In short, the son of Germany could prove to be a class apart, especially if The New One continues to drift right at his hurdles, a habit which threatens his hopes of becoming a champion. Jezki is solid and comes to himself at this time of year on spring ground, but his limitations have been somewhat exposed by Hurricane Fly in Ireland this winter and he remains vulnerable to an emerging talent like Faugheen. Hurricane Fly has been done few favours by the drying ground, but the third of Mullins’ representatives, Arctic Fire, could sneak into the places. Tuesday’s nap vote goes the way of CAUSE OF CAUSES (Cheltenham, nap, 4.40), who appears to have undergone an interesting preparation for the National Hunt Chase and was a fine second in a handicap at the meeting 12 months ago when an error at the last fence denied him victory.

Faugheen arguably faces the most competition with last year's winner Jezki and The New One, an unlucky third following an interrupted passage, in opposition along with National Hunt legend Hurricane Fly . However, Faugheen's potential is as yet untapped, whereas the level his rivals have reached is known — albeit a lofty standard. The selection could prove to be a class apart, especially if The New One continues to drift right at his hurdles,","

"A Texas state trooper who did what millions of hip-hop fans would love to do and posed for a picture with Snoop Dogg was told he has ''deficiencies indicating need for counseling'. Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears posed for the photograph with Snoop at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech. Spears, who is based out of the state's Gilmer office, posed for the photo at the rapper's request. Scroll down for video . Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears (left) was disciplined last week for posing with Snoop Dogg . Snoop requested the photo at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech . Spears' bosses called Snoop a figure who has a 'criminal background including numerous drug charges' After his publicist took the photo, Snoop - whose real name is Calvin Broadus - posted it to Instagram with the caption: 'Me n my deputy dogg'. Spears' bosses at DPS saw the posting and then cited him, according to the Dallas Morning News. The official reprimand read: 'While working a secondary employment job, Trooper Spears took a photo with a public figure who has a well-known criminal background including numerous drug charges. 'The public figure posted the photo on social media and it reflects poorly on the Agency.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him. Snoop has convictions for drug possession and stood trial for murder in 1993 before being acquitted. Since Spears was only reprimanded with counseling, DPS does not view the penalty as a formal disciplinary action and the trooper cannot appeal. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said on Wednesday: 'DPS does not typically discuss or release specifics of personnel issues unless they result in disciplinary action as outlined in Government Code 411.00755 and 411.0072. 'Supervisors counsel and coach employees on a regular basis, and these efforts do not constitute formal discipline by the department.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him but that's about it . Attorney Ty Clevenger is representing Spears and covering the case on his blog. He wrote: 'DPS claims that the counseling forms are not really discipline, therefore the employee has no right to appeal. 'Yet those counseling incidents can block a trooper’s chances for promotion or advancement. 'So it appears that DPS commanders are papering Billy’s file with counseling incidents because they can’t prove that he violated any law, order, or policy, and they know that he will beat them with the law and the facts if he is given an opportunity to appeal.' Clevenger is calling public attention to the situation and has written letters to officials at DPS. It seems the Department of Public Safety has a problem with Snoop but Austin police seem okay with him .

"(CNN)Do you remember the talk about plans for Iraqi-led force to try to take back Mosul this spring? Well, you might want to forget it. Nearly three months after a U.S. official said up to 25,000 Iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern Iraqi city in April or May, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said Thursday that Washington is ""not putting a timeframe on"" a possible invasion. It ""might be some time from now. Might be soon,"" another senior administration official said. Mosul has long been the big prize in the Iraqi government's fight -- aided by a U.S.-led military coalition, which has carried out airstrikes for months -- to defeat ISIS. It has also long been a source of embarrassment, considering how it fell after Iraqi troops dropped their weapons, abandoned their posts and ran for their lives when militants arrived last June. The senior administration officials who talked to reporters Thursday stressed the Iraqis and their allies are making progress in their fight against the group that calls itself the Islamic State. In fact, officials insist that ISIS has been degraded substantially thanks to a combination of air power and ground combat. The biggest and most recent example of this came with the recapture a few weeks ago of Tikrit, the hometown of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein that is located some 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Baghdad. Iraqi forces aided by Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen took that northern city, the same place where ISIS allegedly massacred Iraqi troops last year. Still, Mosul isn't Tikrit. For one thing, it has a lot more people -- about a million, one Obama administration official noted. And it's more important not only to Iraq, but ISIS, meaning the terrorist group has all the more reason to go all-out to defend it. In some ways, the campaign for Mosul has begun, according to officials. There are no plans for U.S. combat troops involvement in an eventual operation, they say, but airstrikes have already targeted ISIS positions in the area. Just because the area has been softened up some from the air, though, doesn't mean a full ground assault is imminent. Calling for ""patience,"" an administration official said that winning Mosul is a complex endeavor. It will ""take a lot of capacity,"" the official said, ""and some time to build.""

"A mother-of-five murdered her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper before hiding her body in a suitcase, a court has heard. Portugese national Claudia Martins, 33, gave birth alone in the bath at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol, having kept the pregnancy a secret for nine months. Bristol Crown Court heard after she allegedly pushed the tissue in the infant's mouth, she wrapped the baby girl in towels and a plastic bag and hid the body in a suitcase - where it was found three days later. Claudia Martins, 33, gave birth alone in the bath at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol, having allegedly kept the pregnancy a secret. She is on trial at Bristol Crown Court (pictured) accused of murdering the baby girl . Paramedics were called to the property after friends and family members found 'a lot of blood' in the bath and Martins was taken to hospital. The court heard Martins repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant. During her hospital stay, Martins' sister noticed a smell coming from the suitcase and called police after she opened it and saw blood. Police found the body of a newborn baby inside a small black suitcase. Martins, who was described as having an extremely low IQ, was arrested and admitted that she had given birth, but said the baby was stillborn. A post-mortem examination found a wad of toilet paper inside the baby's mouth, which experts claim was 'deliberately inserted'. Martins, who denies a single charge of murder on September 12 last year, wept during the opening of her trial at Bristol Crown Court today. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, said two police officers were called to the flat Martins shared with her sister on September 15 last year. 'They were shown to the bathroom of the flat, where they saw and opened a suitcase,' he said. 'Inside, wrapped in towels and in a black plastic bag, they found the body of a newborn baby girl. Martins was rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary (pictured) but repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant - she was later arrested after her sister discovered the baby's body in a suitcase . 'The baby had been born three days earlier to the defendant, Claudia Martins. 'It is the prosecution's case that she killed the baby as soon as it was born and that she hid the body in the suitcase. 'It is the defence case that she never knew she was pregnant and when she gave birth it was stillborn and that she hid it in the suitcase out of a mixture of shock and panic.' The jury heard Martins is originally from Mozambique but moved to Portugal before settling in Bristol in 2011. She lived in a two-bedroom flat with her sister, Vilma Marshall, Ms Marshall's partner, and five children, which was 'difficult and pressurised', Mr Vaitilingam said. In late 2013 Martins became pregnant and the father of the baby was later identified by DNA analysis as Polish man

"England’s fourth Six Nations runners-up finish in a row has been labelled ‘unacceptable’ by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie, with head coach Stuart Lancaster told performances must improve before the World Cup. Lancaster’s men suffered heartache as their thrilling 55-35 victory over France on Saturday saw them fall six points short of overhauling Ireland and securing a first title since 2011. But Ritchie said: ‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about. We should be winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things. England are left reeling on the pitch as their 55-35 victory against France failed to secure the title . Captain Chris Robshaw (fourth right) looks dejected after England concede a try to France at Twickenham . Stuart Lancaster (left) and his players ponder a second-placed finish for a fourth successive season . ‘We had opportunities, let’s be clear — entirely in our control. The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. We did not do enough. There’s no point in bleating about it. ‘We didn’t take opportunities, didn’t do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win.’ But there was more than a little sense that Ian Ritchie was playing to his audience at Twickenham. And not only because the RFU’s affable chief executive quoted Hamlet when describing the ‘slings and arrows of outrageous fortune’ he experienced watching the engrossing Six Nations denouement. His public pronouncements were designed to strike a chord with those still uncomfortable with the six-year contracts served to England’s coaches last year. They were also designed as a shot across head coach Stuart Lancaster’s bows. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie (right) chats to Lancaster at England's base in Pennyhill Park in Bagshot . Ritchie (left) and Lancaster talk in the Twickenham stands prior to England's clash with New Zealand . Ritchie, an intelligent and thoughtful man, needed very little pressing to deliver the headline-grabbing line that England’s fourth successive runners-up spot under Lancaster was ‘unacceptable’. Often it takes hundreds of questions to extract such strong quotes from a senior figure. Yesterday it took two. It was almost as if Ritchie had decided what he was going to say in advance. This was no slip of the tongue. More a clever piece of brinkmanship designed to keep the pressure on Lancaster. The aim was also to avoid accusations that complacency has crept into an organisation which has pulled itself back from the brink in the public’s eyes since the dark days surrounding the scandal-hit 2011 World Cup campaign. Ritchie, the man at the top of an organisation now delivering everywhere but on the pitch, felt the need to crack the whip. Just not too hard. ‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about,’ said the former chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. ‘If you go back through history, bearing in mind a lot

"(CNN)Israel has again voted for a national leader who acts as if he considers one-fifth of its country's citizens -- including me and my family -- to be an existential threat. We were born into the wrong tribe, so to speak. Campaign season shed light on the troubling reality in Israel -- that tribalism trumps democracy and ethnicity trumps citizenship. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Arabs were ""being bused to the polling station in droves,"" people around the world were justifiably horrified. And Monday, in response to the outrage, he apologized for his statement, offering that he knew his comments ""offended members of the Israeli Arab community."" But Netanyahu's policies speak much more loudly than his half-apology. And with him poised to serve a fourth term, many Palestinian citizens of Israel fear, with good reason, that his victory means it is open season for anti-Arab racism in the Knesset and in the streets. Israel's war on its Palestinian citizens is nothing new; our rights have been under attack for years (imagine a proposal that forced Jewish Americans to sign a ""loyalty oath"" to the United States as was proposed for Palestinians and other non-Jewish citizens of Israel). However, the majority's attempt to further entrench institutionalized racism and deny the rights of indigenous Palestinians has achieved frightening momentum. The controversial ""Jewish Nation-State Bill"" that previously floundered in the Knesset has been resurrected. The bill, if passed, would codify the principle of preserving a Jewish ethnic majority. There are versions of it that establish Hebrew as the sole official language and recognize Jewish religious law as a ""source of inspiration for the Knesset."" Even Israel's Supreme Court has come under attack in recent years for occasionally defending minority rights, which some view as a threat to the legal privileges afforded its Jewish citizens. In response, the government changed the Supreme Court's composition to tilt it further to the right. Today, the sole Arab Supreme Court justice, Salim Jubran, very often serves as a dissenting voice in judgments where the court favors legislation demeaning to Israel's Palestinian citizens. Opinion: How Obama handed Netanyahu victory . The 2011 Admissions Committees Law — upheld in 2014 by the more conservative Supreme Court, which includes the first Israeli settler jurist — allows hundreds of localities in Israel to essentially reject applicants seeking to buy homes built on state land because the applicants are deemed ""unsuitable."" The law caused an outcry among Palestinian citizens and human rights groups, who assert that it's simply a thinly disguised effort to discriminate against Israeli citizens on the basis of ethnicity. Simply put, the law enforces segregation within Israel, helping to keep Palestinian citizens out of Jewish communities. Attempts to marginalize Palestinian citizens of Israel also extend to the political sphere. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's successful push to raise the threshold required to win seats in the Knesset was a move designed to exclude Palestinian lawmakers. Ironically, that move backfired, prompting four Arab parties to create the Arab Joint List, whose members span a wide ideological spectrum. Despite their political

"A tiny Scottish hamlet named Towie is bracing itself for the world's next gold rush - after prospectors found evidence that it sits on major deposits. The remote community in Aberdeenshire does not even have a shop but local streams have been well known for grains of gold of 'significant size' for decades. Towie has been ignored by investors in favour of the oil industry but a two-year investigation has revealed the possible existence of gold deposits worth millions. A significant deposit is believed by scientists to lie somewhere near Towie which shares its name with the popular Essex reality TV show . Sleepy Towie, population 300, has a single road, a few houses, primary school, church, graveyard and a community hall . Turkish mining giant Koza Altin Isletmeleri and a Highland firm GreenOre are now seeking planning permission for further investigation. GreenOre managing director Gavin Berkenheger, 31, said: 'This area in Aberdeenshire has all the right hallmarks of a major deposit to be hiding underneath the surface. 'We looked at the geology and found some really exciting rocks with potential for a large deposit. 'Over two years we have found that the whole of Aberdeenshire is a ripe area for gold mineralisation. We're just trying to locate where the gold deposit is.' He added: 'A 3.5million ounce gold deposit is currently being developed by Dalradian Gold in Northern Ireland. We hope to repeat this success.'

They have carried out test drills with more planned, pending pemission. Mr. Berkenheger said the the development of a gold mine was at a very early stage but claimed the area had 'enormous potential'. Panning for gold: Local streams have been well known for grains of gold of 'significant size' for decades . He added: 'We're testing the rock and soil to sample whether it has the potential for gold beneath it. 'We're trying to locate where this deposit will be and we will jump those hurdles when we get there. 'The only way we will know for sure is when we start drilling which we hope to be doing next year. 'Initially we will cover the area with stream sediment sampling - the old-school way. 'Then from the streams with high gold content, we will crack open any rocks we think have the potential of hosting gold.

"His legacy is everywhere on this glorious island. From roads and agriculture to the design of the local flag, Napoleon Bonaparte transformed Elba when he was banished here in 1814. Famously, he didn't stay for long. It was 200 years ago that he escaped, bound for Waterloo and on to a more permanent exile in St Helena. But the locals still revere the celebrity prisoner who, for just under a year, was formally recognised as the King of Elba. Inviting: The pretty harbour of Portoferraio in Elba, an island which lies just 12 miles off the coast of Tuscany . In this anniversary year, there are plenty of pageants and parades in his honour. Yet, as I sit bobbing on the waters below his villa, I can't help thinking that Napoleon must have spent his later years wondering why he ever left. For there is something magical, something other about Elba. Half the size of the Isle of Wight, this fish-shaped island has 3,000ft peaks, coral reefs, beaches of every complexion and Italy's lowest crime rate. Though just 12 miles off the coast of Tuscany, it bears little resemblance to the chi-chi tourist trap of Chiantishire. The vast majority of visitors who make the one-hour ferry crossing from Piombino are ordinary Italians (we don't meet a Briton all week). With a tiny airport, it has been spared major development, and half of its 85 square miles area is national park. Many beaches and bays can be reached only by hiking, biking or, better still, by boat. That is why Elba is perfect for a sailing holiday, whether you are a sailor or not. A comfortable six-bed, 40ft yacht can be a lot cheaper than a hotel or villa. You'd be hard-pushed to find a view to match the one from our deck as we sit back, beer in hand, and watch the sun set behind Monte Capanne. Blissful bobbing: Lovely Porto Azzurro is an ideal place to drop anchor, perfect for pizzas and people-watching . Kent-based Nautilus Yachting has yachts all over the Med and has been organising charters around Elba and the Tuscan archipelago for years. We settle on a Bavaria 40, a popular cruising yacht with a flip-down bathing platform at the back. Little sailors: Robert's children adored life on board . The only question is: who will do the sailing? Nautilus can organise a skipper for £90 a day. But having been messing around in boats since childhood, I want to take charge. You might almost call it a Napoleon complex (my wife does). So I have to go back to school. The basic requirement for renting anything larger than a day boat is the Royal Yachting Association's Day Skipper certificate, within easy reach of the average dinghy sailor. It involves a five-day practical sailing course plus a detailed theory course. You can do the latter online, but you must live aboard for the practical part. Sunsail runs flotillas and courses all over the world, and I join the fleet on the Solent. It proves invaluable; after five days

"(CNN)This week, social media heralded as #motheroftheyear Toya Graham, the Baltimore single mom who pulled her son, who was holding a brick, away from the scene of a riot. A video of Graham yanking young Michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral. Many called her a hero: a mother determined to stop the cycle of violence. And yet, wasn't she also promoting violence? Her own reaction, after all, was to yell, curse and hit. ""Why is America celebrating the beating of a black child?"" asked a writer at The Washington Post. Isn't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home? Isn't this why rioting happens? I'm not excusing violence in any form. I wish it didn't exist. But Baltimore isn't on fire because of mothers like Graham. In fact, what we need, not only in communities like Baltimore but also in communities around the country, are more mothers like her. Mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence. I don't see Graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel, or at least the inevitability, of violence. I don't see her as a hero, either. What I do see in Graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents, mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence. Mothers who know the anger and frustration that can result when they catch their teenager in a lie. As Graham told Anderson Cooper, she'd told Michael the night before not to join in any riots. He swore he wouldn't. But her momma bear sense kicked in, and when she heard that school was closing early, she didn't take the chance that he'd stick to his promise. She went to the site of the riots to make sure that she could help him stay the course. She went there so that she could help him keep his promise. And when she got there and saw he hadn't, as she suspected, she reacted in the way that she knew would, in that moment, be most effective to get him out of there. And that's the key here. It's easy to punish a teenager for acting out, just as it's easy to punish Graham for taking out her frustrations on Michael in a physical way. But Graham's actions are evidence of her commitment as a parent. For better or worse, she knows her son. And she knows her community, and her reality. She knows that she's the mother of an adolescent boy living in a city caught up in a very heated, violent moment. And she will do anything to protect her son, including put herself in a dangerous situation to pull him out of there. Can we all say that? Toya Graham raises an important point that's often missing in the discussions of how to

"Super midwife Kathleen McSherry has retired after delivering a record 7,000 babies. Colleagues believe Kathleen, 66, from Faifley, West Dunbartonshire, has notched up more births than any other British midwife in a career spanning six decades. She said: 'It's been a labour of love. Every delivery has been a very special moment for me. Bringing a new life into the world is the best job in the world.' Kathleen McSherry from Faifley, West Dunbartonshire, has delivered more than 7,000 babies since 1966 . Kathleen with one of her many deliveries, left, and hard at work for Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS . She continued: 'The sheer joy of being at a family's happiest moment is truly wonderful. I'll miss it so much.' Kathleen, who is a fan of the hit TV show Call the Midwife, has spent her career in the bustling maternity wards of three busy Glasgow hospitals - Stobhill, The Queen Mother's and the Southern General. The father of a child she delivered worked out she must have delivered more than 7,000 babies - based on the fact she's delivered three babies per shift on average. Fellow midwives agree they are unaware of anyone who has helped deliver so many babies. Kathleen's daughter Ashley, who set up a Facebook page in her honour, said: 'She has enjoyed every one of her days working to deliver babies and we are all very proud of her service to the NHS. I think she will miss it so much now she's retired.' The mother-of-four and grandmother-of-five has enjoyed a career which mirrors her favourite TV programme, Call The Midwife. Kathleen, second from right, has been delivering babies at three Glasgow hospitals for six decades . Kathleen started training in the 60s and her career mirrors that of her favourite TV programme Call the Midwife . She began her training in 1966 aged just 17, after working as a sales assistant in the former Glen's department store in Glasgow. During her career there has never been a dull moment. She has assisted at the births of two babies born in hospital car parks and has even had two children named after her. 'It's a lovely compliment and one that midwives love,' Kathleen said. She's delivered too many twins to mention and has also delivered countless children and grandchildren of the children she's brought into the world. 'You can plan to have your baby in hospital but they often have minds of their own and arrive at the least expected time,' she said. 'They set the agenda and there is little you can do when a determined baby decides it's time to be born.' The most magical moment in Kathleen's career was being at the birth of two of her grandchildren . She also had a surprise delivery of her own when she was forced to advise husband Jim, 67, a retired firefighter, what to do when she went into labour with their fourth child Katey. 'It was five in the morning when I woke up in labour and Jim ushered our older kids, Pauline,

"David Cameron's claim to be a 'tax-cutting politician' was under fire last night – as a study found the Coalition has raised taxes by more than £16billion a year. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies said the net effect of changes by the Coalition had raised taxes by an average £255 for every person in the UK. The respected think-tank found the tax rises totalled £64.3billion – including a £14billion hike in VAT and a £5.2billion increase in National Insurance contributions. Millions of people have been dragged into paying the 40p tax rate for the first time – and inheritance tax has increased as thresholds have been frozen for years. Humiliating: Revelation that the Coalition has raised taxes is embarrassing for Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured), who has spoken repeatedly of his desire to be seen as a 'tax cutter' The tax hikes have been only partially offset by reductions totalling £48billion – including £8billion from raising the personal income tax threshold, £5.9billion in lowering corporation tax and £3.9billion from real-terms cuts in fuel duties. Ministers insist the tax rises were needed to help plug the budget deficit left by Labour. Sources say they had no choice but to take 'difficult decisions' to save Britain from bankruptcy. But the findings remain embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who has spoken repeatedly of his desire to be seen as a 'tax cutter'. They show the value of the rise in personal income tax allowance has been wiped out by rises in other levies. In next week's Budget, Chancellor George Osborne, is expected to announce a further increase in the personal allowance, along with modest cuts in alcohol duties. But Treasury sources admit they have little money to play with. The IFS said the Coalition's changes represented a 'missed opportunity to improve the tax system', with little attempt to address 'fundamental structural deficiencies'. Several of the changes have increased 'unwelcome distortions' in the system, the think-tank added. It said it was difficult to find a 'good economic reason' for lifting lower-paid workers out of income tax while leaving National Insurance thresholds largely untouched – warning it was an 'absurdity' that the two taxes were not integrated. Warned: The UK Statistics authority has 'ticked off' Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls for claiming the number of workers on zero-hours contracts had increased by 400,000 in recent months . Ed Balls has been ticked off by the statistics watchdog for claiming the number of workers on zero-hours contracts had increased by 400,000 in recent months. Sir Andrew Dilnot, of the UK Statistics Authority, said Mr Balls's statement was incorrect, as it relied on comparing totals at two different times of year and ignored the possibility that some people could hold multiple contracts for different jobs. The study praised last year's stamp duty reforms. But it warned that council tax had been allowed to get 'ever more out of date', with bands in England and Scotland based on 1991 property prices. It added that areas such as fuel duties and business rates had seen 'ad hoc, often temporary, announcements overtaking each

A prominent winemaker is accused of destroying more than $300,000 worth of alcohol at the winery he was previously employed at. Trevor David Jones, 57, of Lyndoch in South Australia's Barossa Valley, allegedly snuck into the Kellermeister winery in the early hours of February 22 and opened the taps on four tanks to release 25,000 litres of wine.

'It is what it is. We can't do much about it, it's in the hands of the police now.' Mr Pearce said his winery predominantly produced high-value shiraz-based wines.

"Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has claimed that Red Bull have launched a bid to buy the Championship club. Cellino, who is currently serving a Football League disqualification, said that Leeds' majority shareholder Eleonora Sport was considering the offer. But Leeds chairman Andrew Umbers said he was not aware of an offer from Red Bull when contacted by BBC Radio Leeds on Saturday morning.

The soft drink giant already own three clubs - RB Leipzig in Germany, Red Bull Salzburg in Austria and MLS side New York Red Bulls - as well as two teams in Formula One. After being linked with a bid in November, Red Bull issued a statement saying: 'Red Bull has no plans to take over Leeds Utd nor take a stake in the club.'

"A new exhibit focusing on Richard Avedon's celebrated photos of political and cultural newsmakers invites visitors to rethink the concept of portraits in the age of the selfie. Richard Avedon: Family Affairs opens Wednesday at the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia. The collection starkly depicts dozens of U.S. movers and shakers from the 1960s and '70s - including Edward Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Nelson Rockefeller and George Bush - in the artist's trademark black-and-white style. Also featured is a small biographical display on Avedon, who was raised Jewish in New York. Men in suits: A new exhibit focuses on Richard Avedon's celebrated photos of political and cultural newsmakers - (left to right) publisher Walter Annenberg, California governor Jerry Brown and 41st President George Bush - in the artist's trademark black-and-white style . Muses: Richard Avedon: Family Affairs is now on in Philadelphia (from left, Katharine Graham president of The Washington Post Company, Barbara C. Jordan the first African American congresswoman and Bella Abzug, a member of U.S. Congress and champion of women's rights) 'Avedon's work is generally shown in art museums as art, with very little historical interpretation,' said chief curator Josh Perelman. 'We invite Avedon in both as a creator and a character.' Avedon made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, but 'Family Affairs' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for Rolling Stone magazine. Originally planning to spotlight the campaigns of incumbent Gerald Ford and challenger Jimmy Carter, Avedon soon realized he wanted to include a wider array of the era's most influential people, Perelman said. Men in suits comprise nearly all his subjects, distinguished by variations in their stances and expressions: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, consumer advocate Ralph Nader and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to name a few.

Rise to fame: Avedon (seen in self potraits above) made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, but 'Family Affairs' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for Rolling Stone magazine . Only a handful of the 12-by-15-inch framed images portray women or minorities, among them Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham and labor activist Cesar Chavez. Rolling Stone called the 69 portraits 'The Family,' though the only people with biological ties are Ted Kennedy and his mother, Rose. Visitors can also page through hard copies of the 40-year-old magazine issue, or look at a digital edition. Yet the exhibit space is dominated by a wall-size display of poet Allen Ginsberg's family. It's one of four featured group portraits that Avedon took between 1969 and 1971. Much smaller pictures include Andy Warhol and members of The Factory; the Chicago 7, who were arrested during the 1968 Democratic National Convention; and the Mission Council, who were key players in the Vietnam

"Between getting children dresses, breakfast on the table, lunches packed and the school run, mornings can be one of the least relaxing times of day. And more specifically, a study of 2.3 million has revealed that 7.35am is the most hectic, frenzied time of the morning routine for Australian families. Sophie Falkiner, Australian TV presenter, model and mother of two, can testify to that. 'It’s crazy, in the mornings there is a million and one things to do - uniforms to be found, spelling tests to get done,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Crazy o'clock: A study of 2.3 million parents has pinpointed 7.35am as the most hectic, frenzied time of day in Australian households . Out the door: Getting breakfast, kids dressed and the school run is the cause of much mayhem . Mum of two: Sophie Falkiner has told Daily Mail Australia that she has a 'million and one' things to do in the mornings to get her children out the door . 'The kids get up at 7am so I have to get up at 6.30 to give myself time to have a coffee and get exercise in before starting the day,' the 41-year-old former Great Outdoors and Wheel of Fortune presenter added. According to the study, conducted by Kraft, breakfast is the top priority for parents - with an average of 140 hours spent making breakfast each year (equivalent to 25 minutes a day). 'We're out the door by 8am, so when we all have time to sit together and have breakfast it's the only zen time we have,' said Falkiner. Time it: Australian parents spend an average 140 hours per year getting children breakfast . 'It will only be 15-20 minutes together (and I wish it could be longer!) but these days people are time poor and its hard to get everything done and be nutritious,' she said. 'My daughter’s not a breakfast person, so getting a quick nut spread and toast in is quick and easy before we head out the door.' The study also found that nut spreads are a popular choice for breakfast loving kids, with Aussie kids eating spreads 6.7 times a week. Mum knows best: Sophie Falkner, mum of two, believes nuts are high in protein and good for fussy eaters . Falkiner, who also has a certificate in nutrition says that nuts are a big part of her children's diet and are packed full of nutritional benefits. 'Nuts are packed with good protein. So the spreads are good for fussy eaters, they give your kids important brain food and energy, protein and it helps keep them full until lunch time.' Falkiner's tip is to mix up how you serve nut spreads to make it both fun and varied for kids. 'I will do peanut butter in celery sticks for the kids then on weekend as a treat they will get pancakes and hazelnut spread,' she said. Spread it around: Falkiner says mix up nut spreads during the week adding to celery sticks or pancakes . 'They'd eat the whole container in

"The bond between a mother and her children is supposed to be unbreakable, but Pauline Bubb's kids turned her into a prisoner in her own home. The 47 year old single mum from Southampton, was beaten up to 30 times a day by her daughter Sapphire, nine, and regularly locked herself away in her bedroom to escape from harm. Her son Spencer, 11,who often joined in with the abuse, was the first to violently abuse his mother - aged four, he stabbed her in the stomach with a pair of scissors. Scroll down for video . Pauline Bubb, 46, from Southampton, who was violently attacked by her 11 year-old-son Spencer, and nine-year-old daughter Sapphire (Pictured from left: Sapphire, Pauline, Spencer and Jorja) The only one of her children who didn't resort to violence was Sapphire's twin sister Jorja, who would often leave the room when the beatings started. Unable to cope, Pauline turned to Channel 5 as a last ditch attempt after hearing about their new programme, My Violent Child. In an interview with the Mirror today, she said: 'I was frightened of my own kids - my legs would often be bruised and I had to keep them covered.' The violence got so bad that Pauline started to dread her children coming home from school and would start shaking as the clock started to move towards 3.30pm. Pauline sought help from the makers of a Channel 5 documentary My Violent Child after years of violence at home at the hands of her children . The aggression would often start as soon as they walked through the front door, with the attacks escalating to the stage where Sapphire once bit her face. In one incident, Spencer attempted to strangle his mother from behind while she was sat in a chair. But while Spencer's behaviour calmed down once he was diagnosed with ADHD, Sapphire's continued to worsen. Pauline said: 'She started off two years ago with controlling behaviour - she would ask me a question like, 'Can I have a packet of crisps?' but then say 'Yes Sapphire'. 'Then I had to say it, but exactly how she wanted me to. I couldn't say it too fast or too slow, I had to stand still, I couldn't move, I couldn't blink and she would repeat herself 20 or 30 times. 'If I said no, she would get louder, start swearing and hit me.' Pauline comforts her daughter Sapphire after one of her tantrums . Although many people would find it incredulous that Pauline allowed the abuse to escalate over a number of years without getting any help, she explains that she was too embarrassed to do anything about the situation. Pauline isn't alone - the number of violent young children in the UK is rising steadily, with 118 boys and girls under the age of 14 prosecuted for domestic abuse in 2012/13. After contacting the makers of My Violent Child, Pauline and her children started working with parenting experts provided by the television station and Pauline says she has seen a dramatic improvement

Tayler Chaice Buzbee was forced to make an emergency appointment at an Aspen Dental facility in Alabama on Friday morning after developing agonizing toothache which would not go away. But after calling the dentist's office, she was informed that the only available appointment was in just 20 minutes - meaning that she had no time to find a babysitter for her infant son, Attley. Instead, Tayler was assured by employees that she could bring her baby to the facility. The pair turned up shortly after - but midway through the appointment, Attley started to create a fuss. Upset: Tayler Chaice Buzbee has spoken of her humiliation after a dental assistant apparently removed her baby son, Attley (pictured with Tayler) from her arms while she was breastfeeding him in the dentist's chair . 'I don't nurse in public, and I never have because I hear these stories about people being shamed... I don't do well with being confronted, so I usually find another room to go to,' Tayler toldAL.com. But she said that, in this instance, she had no option but to breastfeed Attley - a gorgeous dark-haired baby with big brown eyes and a cheeky grin - because he was hungry and causing a scene. The hygienists apparently did not mind Tayler nursing her son - and one even offered to halt the treatment and return when she was finished. But Tayler declined and continued to be treated. A short while later, the dentist and another female employee came into the room. The latter reportedly told Tayler that she was not permitted to breastfeed her baby in the dentist's office. Then, while the dentist examined Tayler's teeth, the employee removed Attley from her arms - without permission and before he had finished feeding from his mom - because he was 'in the way'. She then placed him in a stroller, it is reported. Tayler, who was shocked, left the office soon after.

She was left 'humiliated' after the breastfeeding incident . Speaking to the news site, the Marshalls employee said: 'I have never felt so humiliated in my life.' She added: 'That was my biggest concern. Don't take him out of my arms. It was a situation where I was humiliated, I was crying, and I felt just embarrassed to be there.' In a statement, Aspen Dental Management Inc apologized to Tayler. 'No nursing mother should ever be made to feel uncomfortable while feeding her child,' representative Kasey Pickett told AL.com.

"Set side by side it’s hard to believe they’re the same person. One with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair. The other, five decades on, pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair. These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Fredric Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High, Irvington, New Jersey. They were taken at the age of 18, when he was, in his own words, just ‘a Jewish kid from Newark,’ and before he had transformed himself, in every sense, into the figure lampooned on Netflix show ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,’ with such devastating consequences.

Now, seen here for the first time, Dr Brandt’s High School photos provide a glimpse into his life before fame, fortune and fillers. The pictures, taken in 1967, show a hint of the smile that, according to the school’s yearbook earned him a reputation for his ‘infectious grin’ and saw him characterized by his sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.’ Born Frederic Sheldon Brandt in 1949, he was prolific in his High School achievements, posing in one photo alongside other award-winning students.

"A church has come under fire over plans to dig up thousands of bodies - including the founder of Western Australia - to make way for a car park. St John's Stoke church, in Guildford, Surrey, wants to build a community centre in its grave yard and replace the current centre with a car park. But the scheme, which would see remains dug up, cremated and reburied in a mass grave, has already sparked outrage with opponents producing a 1,400-signature petition in a bid to save the graveyard. St John's Stoke church (pictured), in Guildford, Surrey, wants to build a community centre in its grave yard and replace the current centre with a car park . The body of Sir James Stirling, a navy admiral and the first governor of Western Australia, is buried in the graveyard . An international dispute threatens to break out as the body of Sir James Stirling, a navy admiral and the first governor of Western Australia, is buried in the graveyard - but the church is not sure where. Reverend Mark Woodward, the church's rector, said: 'We have heard a large number of views ranging from strong opposition to our plans, to very strong support in favour. 'We hope and pray that something very positive will come from the proposal to see land used to help fund an excellent new community project. Sir James Stirling become the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Western Australia . It was Sir James Stirling’s persistence that finally persuaded the British government to establish the Swan River Colony in Western Australia. The British naval officer, who was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1791, had explored the area before lobbying officials to allow him to establish a settlement. And it was a move that would eventually see him become the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Western Australia. Stirling entered the navy at the age of 12 and went on to serve in the Napoleonic wars and the war between Britain and the US in 1812. He married Ellen Mangles at Stoke Church, Guildford, on September 3 1823. They went on to have five sons and six daughters. Stirling travelled to Australia a few years later as part of a navy assignment and joined an inland expedition – eventually taking him to the west. He would go on to oversee the development of the surrounding area and remained in his post until 1838 when he resumed his naval career. Stirling became an admiral in the 1860s and died in retirement at Guildford on April 22 1865. 'We are in contact with the descendants of some families who believe they have ancestors interred in the graveyard and we are listening very carefully. We are committed to working very closely with all interested parties. 'It is inspiring to see our church facilities put to such great and varied use by so many people every week, but we are simply running out of space.' Sir Stirling was buried at the site following his death in 1865 but when a new rectory was built on the western

"Mark Cavendish has issued a typically blunt assessment of the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report into past practices of doping and suggested Lance Armstrong's charity return to the Tour de France 'could be done in a different environment'. CIRC was established to investigate whether the UCI, cycling's world governing body, was complicit in past doping practices, such as the Armstrong affair, which saw the American stripped of his seven Tour titles and banned for life. Some of the reports findings were scathing but, according to 2011 world champion and 25-time Tour stage winner Cavendish, little was revelatory. Mark Cavendish says there were few revelations in the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report . The 25-time Tour de France stage winner said the report was 'all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document' Cavendish, speaking after announcing he'll compete in August's Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic, said: 'To be brutally honest, I don't really think there's anything new in there. 'There's all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document. 'People talk about the past of cycling like it's the present. It's a little bit frustrating; that would be an understatement. 'As long as cycling's cleaning up and I'm racing in a fair playing field in a sport I love, then I'll continue to be happy with that.' One unnamed but 'respected' professional cyclist told CIRC that 90 per cent of the professional peloton continues to dope, while another reported the figure was 20 per cent. Cavendish doesn't see much use in the report, commissioned by new UCI president Brian Cookson . Cavendish did not confirm if he had read the report in full or just the media dispatches which followed its publication earlier this month. He did not speak to CIRC and was unaware that riders could approach the commission to share their views. Asked if he felt the report represented the views of the modern peloton, Cavendish said: 'Absolutely not. I really don't. I wasn't asked at all to say anything. 'Ninety-five per cent of the peloton will know the one rider who will have said certain comments and the other five per cent won't have raced or known that rider, so couldn't comment on it. 'I think certain quotes from unreliable sources don't really mean anything and completely warp the sense of the whole process.' Armstrong plans to return to the Tour alongside former footballer Geoff Thomas, another cancer survivor. Lance Armstrong (left) plans to return to the Tour de France, the event for which he was stripped of seven titles due to doping, as part of a charity ride with former footballer Geoff Thomas . Thomas is riding the Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton, which includes Cavendish, to raise funds for charity and has invited Armstrong to join him. Cavendish said: 'There's no denying what Lance did for charity; he did work a lot for charity. 'But maybe this situation could be done in a different environment.'

"A Japanese woman got sweet revenge on her cheating boyfriend by giving his Apple collection a good wash. The unnamed heartbroken girlfriend clearly knew how to hit her lying lover where it hurts, and dumped his iMac, iPhone, iPad and accessories in the bath tub. She then took photos of the gadget Jacuzzi, and sent them to him. Presumably on the one item of technology that wasn't currently taking a long soak. A Japanese woman got sweet revenge on her cheating boyfriend by giving his Apple collection a good wash . The woman scorned took the trouble to give his iMac - which start at £899 - a single soaking . As most of us know, a substantial splash is enough to send your gadget to glitch town, and so the dip this man's prized collection took is sure to prove irreversible damage. Particularly as the woman scorned took the trouble to give his iMac - which start at £899 - a single soaking. Just to make doubly sure the water damage was total. Even if he tries the recommended trick of leaving his gadgets in uncooked rice for 48 hours, we think all the rice in Japan couldn't dry this lot out. Clearly feeling little remorse for his sins and perhaps looking for sympathy, the unnamed man, also from Japan, Tweeted the pics to his account @foolishnessfly2. Retweeted more than 15,400 times, the response has been mixed. The hearts of Apple fans are mainly with the man, with the general consensus being that destroying a fellow's prized Apple collection is a bit harsh, even if he did cheat. This Twitterer fully supported the Japanese woman's actions, hailing it as 'the best revenge' @womenspeakup pointed out that the guy should be counting his lucky stars that it was his Apple and not his, er, banana that paid the price of cheating . @jewlish spoke the words of women the world over with a 'you go, girl!'. Japanese @Allorcer90 took the time to explain the images to the English-speaking Twitterers who wondered what they were about, adding that it will make you think twice about cheating . While others agree that revenge is a dish best served in hot water. Although a lot of the comments were in Japanese (and the 'translate' button did little to help), the English-language responses were in favour of the woman's methods. @babysdoc hailed it as 'the best revenge', while @jewlish spoke the words of women the world over with a 'you go, girl!'. @womenspeakup pointed out that the guy should be counting his lucky stars that it was his Apple and not his, er, banana that paid the price of cheating, referring to Lorena Bobbit who cut off her husband's penis with a knife. Meanwhile, Japanese @Allorcer90 took the time to explain the images to the English-speaking Twitterers who wondered what they were about, adding, 'Haha makes you think twice about cheating on your significant other haha!'

"Michael Vaughan, who is favourite to become England’s cricket supremo, was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on. With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit. If you can’t play that, you’re in the wrong job.’ Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England's top order for just looking to survive . Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua . Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning . Former fast bowler Bob Willis said: ‘England’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs.’ West Indies’ early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves, the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, who labelled the opposition ‘mediocre’.

"A drought in the western United States has left water levels in the Colorado River basin far below their normal levels. Lake Powell, a reservoir at the Arizona-Utah border, is 45 per cent below its capacity, and the lack of water has left a 'bathtub ring' at the bottom of its majestic rock formations. The lake, from which the Colorado eventually snakes through Grand Canyon National Park, has lost 4.4 trillion gallons of water in a recent drought. The river's basin has been experiencing the drought for eleven of the last 14 years, shrinking a reservoir that was one-fourth the size of Rhode Island when it was at 'full pool', according to National Geographic. Scroll down for video . Lake Powell, which is the country's second-largest reservoir when it is at 'full pool' capacity, now has a white bathtub ring in its canyons from dropping water levels . The Colorado provides water for Nevada, Arizona and California, the last of which has seen large areas in 'extreme' and 'exceptional' drought levels and is trying to restrict how much water residents use. Seven states and 40million people get water from different parts of the river's basin, which extends into the southern reaches of Wyoming. Many climate scientists think that the Southwest is also due for a megadrought this century that would far outlast the current phenomenon. Lake Mead, the reservoir next to Hoover Dam, shrunk to 39 per cent of its capacity last year and was at its lowest level since the dam was built in the 1930s. To help the other reserve keep a steady supply, Lake Powell will release 8.23 million acre-feet (2.68 trillion gallons) downstream over the course of this year. The release is estimated to lower the water level at Powell, the second largest reservoir in the country behind Mead, by another meter. It is in danger of seeing its surface elevation fall below 1,075 feet above sea level by September, which would be the lowest level on record, set in 2005, and increase the size of its bleached white ring. Minerals in the water turn the walls of the sandstone canyons white, according to the Weather Channel. Minerals in the Colorado River turned the sides of Lake Powell's canyons white before the water levels dropped and the discoloration could be seen . Lake Powell provides water to Nevada, Arizona, and California, which has been experiencing its own drought problems .

Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying for the much-maligned Europa League outweigh the negatives . The lack of Champions League football - which Spurs have missed out on since the 2010-11 season - is seen as a barrier to signing top-class players for clubs of Tottenham's size, but Eriksen says missing out on the Europa League would have the same effect. 'Is it a factor when the club are trying to sign players? I think so,' Eriksen said. 'It certainly was for me when I moved from Ajax two years ago. 'I always want to play in Europe, to be seen on that stage or in the Premier League. It was a big chance and for me it was a nice thing when I came to Tottenham.' Tottenham have been linked with Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin and Dynamo Kiev forward Andriy Yarmolenko, and Eriksen worries that Spurs could have to lower their sights if they are not on the European stage next season. Mauricio Pochettino's side currently sit sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which is enough to qualify . Eriksen says the lure of Europa League football was important in his decision to join Spurs back in 2013 . And while he admits that missing out makes finishing higher up the table easier, Eriksen doesn't see many issues with the competition itself. 'I'd rather play in Europe than nothing,' he told the Evening Standard. 'There are many games, of course, but if you have a big squad as we have, it shouldn't be a disappointment to play in Europe. A lot of players want to be in Europe. We've been fighting to get into the top four and we still have a little chance. Florian Thauvin (right), the Marseille midfielder, is one player who has been linked with a move to Spurs . Dynamo Kiev's Andriy Yarmolenko is thought to be another target for Tottenham in the summer market . 'Of course, it is easier to get into the top four if you are not in Europe. There are so many games and we have played more games than most teams in the Premier League this season.' As it stands, the Premier League's top six will all qualify for Europe but if Arsenal win the FA Cup final against Aston Villa that number would extend to the seventh-placed side. West Ham could also find themselves in the Europa League next season

"Fired: Visual arts teacher Traci Gauthier was let go by St Vrain Valley school district last week after posting a picture of freshman Phoenix Bowen on Instagram . A Colorado visual arts high school teacher has been fired after posting a picture of a student on her Instagram account. Traci Gauthier was substituting for a different class in Skyline High School in Longmont, Colorado, when she posted a photo of freshman Phoenix Bowen as he walked out of the room. The caption of the photo read: 'STEM kids are trying too hard. I don't know him, but I hate him. #pothead #STEM #wannabecool #dorkywhiteboy'. Phoenix became aware of the picture after his friend showed it to him after class. 'You can't hate me, you don't know me,' he commented on the post. Gauthier was quick to respond, saying, 'I know I don't know you-but I can hate anyone I'd like. #Nobig #Dontbesad #MeanArtTeacher.' Phoenix thought the most offensive part was the hashtag accusing him of being a pothead because 'It's false,' he told FOX31. He said Gauthier was probably making a reference to his backpack, which has a logo of the energy drink CannaEnergy on it. The company's logo includes a hemp leaf, though there's no THC in the drink. 'People automatically see the hemp leaf and assume it is a pot leaf and pot is ""stoner"", and that's not what it's about,' Phoenix told FOX. Words hurt: The caption of Gauthier's photo read, 'STEM kids are trying too hard. I don't know him, but I hate him. #pothead #STEM #wannabecool #dorkywhiteboy' Phoenix's father Erich Bowen said that he's worried about his son, who is usually outgoing. 'I can see a difference in Phoenix's attitude and the way he's handling himself,' he told FOX31. 'This is bullying. This is a lot of lines crossed.' St. Vrain Valley School District told FOX31 that it did not have a social media policy for teachers and said on Thursday that Gauthier was no longer employed. The district's school board president Bob Smith said the photo could be seen as a threat to student welfare, according to Denver Post. Crossed the line: Phoenix's father, Erich Bowen (left) says Gouthier's Instagram post should be considered bullying that targeted Phoenix (right) Not a stoner: Phoenix said he was offended by Gauthier's '#pothead' hashtag, because he says 'it's false'. His backpack has an energy drink logo on it that includes a hemp leaf . 'We would take bullying from anyone absolutely seriously, and particularly from a teacher,' he said. 'Student wellbeing is our number one priority. Without a strong sense of wellbeing, students can't learn.' In April of 2014, Gauthier appeared to share that stance on bullying when sent a letter to board members addressing the district's policy. 'Something as simple as having announcements and fliers around the building can dramatically improve the climate of anti-bullying in a building and make kids feel safer,' wrote Gauthier, who was one of the school's gay-straight alliance advisers. 'That is the beauty and power of advertising. Presidents, senators, school board members, etc.

"A would-be Lib Dem MP who describes himself as a feminist has been filmed repeatedly trying to touch a naked lap dancer. Married father-of-one Maajid Nawaz asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London. Footage shows the prospective parliamentary candidate – who calls himself an advocate of women’s rights – attempting to touch her arms and thighs, which is against the venue’s policy. Scroll down for video . Up close: Would-be MP Maajid Nawaz with a scantily-clad lap dancer in the club in east London . Seedy: The married father-of-one asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London . Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘outrageous’. In the film, Nawaz – a convicted former extremist – can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him in a private room during two £20 lap dances. Manager Jay Shah, who witnessed Nawaz’s behaviour, said he was ‘very drunk’ and bouncers threatened to throw him out several times. ‘He was asking her to touch him and he was touching her,’ he said. ‘In general he was quite persistent with her, asking to take her out and for her number.’ A rising star of the Liberal Democrats, 37-year-old Nawaz is also a leading figure in the Muslim community and head of anti-extremism charity the Quilliam Foundation, which he set up. Rising star: The prospective parliamentary candidate with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . A regular guest on BBC News programmes, he declared on Newsnight in 2013: ‘I consider myself a feminist.’ He once wrote on Twitter: ‘You don’t need to be a woman to stand for women’s rights.’ He often throws his weight behind gender issues such as the campaign against female genital mutilation and paints himself as a role model for young Muslim men at risk of radicalisation. But Abdul Malik, the club’s owner, said he wanted the video to be seen by the public because of the way Nawaz portrays himself as a feminist and a family man. ‘He’s always talking about religion on TV and I thought, what a hypocrite,’ he said. He claimed ‘arrogant’ Nawaz acts like a ‘spokesman for Islam’ – but visited the club during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘outrageous’ The full strip club footage, obtained by the Mail, clearly shows Nawaz receiving two five-minute lap dances an hour apart. He and two friends paid £10 entry to the small ‘gentleman’s club’ in Whitechapel and were seen drinking heavily. He left the club alone in the early hours of the morning. During the first session – in which the dancer gets naked – she has to repeatedly remove his hands from her body and pushes him away at one point. During the second dance with the same woman, he also spends time chatting to her – whispering into her ear and trying to touch her hair. Newlywed: Nawaz's

"Packaged vegetable juice, yogurt and and ketchup are some of the foods which contain high levels of stealth sugars. And if you're feeling virtuous about your healthy breakfast of wholegrain cereal washed down with a glass of orange juice, you might want to stop being so smug. Health conscious consumers are likely to shun sweet treats but some seemingly healthier options are actually more sugar-laden than we realise. Stealth sugars are sneaking their way into our diets, sending our intake soaring above recommended limits (Picture posed by model) Choose water or unsweetened fruit juice instead of sugary fizzy drinks and juice drinks. Remember to dilute these for children . If you like fizzy drinks, try diluting fruit juice with sparking water . Swap cakes or biscuits for a currant bun, scone or some malt loaf with low-fat spread . If you take sugar in hot drinks or add sugar to breakfast cereal, gradually reduce the amount until you can cut it out altogether . Rather than spreading jam, marmalade, syrup, treacle or honey on your toast, try a low-fat spread, sliced banana or low-fat cream cheese . Check nutrition labels to help pick the foods with less added sugar, or opt for low-sugar versions . Try halving the sugar you use in recipes, it works for most things, except jam, meringues and ice cream . Choose tins of fruit in juice rather than syrup . Choose wholegrain breakfast cereals, but not those coated with sugar or honey . Source: NHS Choices . A bowl of Bran Flakes plus a glass of orange juice will account for half your recommended daily amount of sugar. Our everyday diets are packed with ‘stealth’ sugar, sending our intake far above the recommended limits, which according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), should be no more than 12 teaspoons a day. Raisins are very sugary, as are flavoured fat-free yoghurts. And one tablespoon of ketchup can contain as much as one teaspoon of sugar. Some bottled juices and smoothies have as much as 47g of sugar, a lot to consume in just one sitting. Like ketchup, tomato-based pasta sauces and soups also have sugar added to them to balance out the acidity of tomatoes. While cereal and granola bars may have a reputation for being healthy, they too are usually much sweeter than they need to be. Sugar is also found in surprisingly large amounts in many savoury foods such as sauces and ready meals. In fact, sugar highly likely to be a much bigger part of your diet than you realise. Surprisingly, ‘healthier’ reduced-fat foods can actually contain more sugar than their full fat counterparts, as stripping out fats from processed foods makes them less appealing to our tastebuds. To combat the lack of flavour, manufacturers increase the levels of sugar in the food. In an investigation for MailOnline, nutritionist Angela Dowden said:' UK guidelines recommend that ‘added’ sugars — those used to sweeten food, fizzy drinks, honeys, syrups and fruit juices — shouldn’t make up more than 10 per cent of the total energy we

"Fallen AFL star Ben Cousins has been taken into police custody for the third time in two weeks. He is currently in the emergency department of Armadale Hospital awaiting a mental health assessment and remains in a stable condition. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. Scroll down for video . Former West Coast Eagles captain Ben Cousins was assessed in the mental health ward at Perth's Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital after being caught on an SAS base in Western Australia on March 15 . The priest tried to confront Cousins before he took off again and stopped a few metres ahead to take photos of the temple. 'Again, I tried to talk to him and he started his car,' Mr Singh said. 'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.' Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police. 'He was not looking stable.' Before they arrived however, Cousins had moved onto another person's house and opened the door before realising Mr and Mrs. Singh were still watching him from their yard. He allegedly jumped fences and scaled a two-story home and paced along the roof. The police arrived ten minutes later and talked Cousins off the room before arresting him in Shreeve Road at 11am. CCTV has shown Cousins attempting to flee from police. 'I was pretty panicked - I locked the doors and we stayed inside in one of the bedrooms until I could get confirmation from police that it (the arrest) was done,' Witness Jenny Wilson told Network Ten.

"Our quest for the perfect garden could be ruining our chances of making contact with ET. This is according to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory who is objecting to proposals by iRobot to release a radio wave-guided lawnmower. It claims iRobot's machines will interfere with its sensitive radio telescopes which astronomers are using to pick up signs of alien life. Our quest for the perfect garden could be ruining our chances of making contact with ET. This is according to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory who is objecting to proposals by iRobot to release a radio wave-guided lawnmower. iRobot is famous for creating self-guided Roomba machines . The problem is the frequency band proposed for the lawnbot is 6240-6740 MHz - the same one several large radio telescopes operate on. 'We'll see the whole thing with our electronics,' Harvey Liszt, spectrum manager for the observatory, told Bloomberg. 'It's a distortion.' iRobot, who has created self-guided Roomba vacuum cleaners, has filed a request with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to use airwaves for its latest design. The Massachusetts company says its vision is to create lawnmowers that are guided wirelessly from beacons on poles stuck into the lawn. Existing models use wires hidden in the ground to set boundaries, rather using airwaves. Astronomers that the frequencies iRobot wants to use are the same as they use to detect methanol – a key sign of star formation. There is already a ban on the use of mobile phone close to the Green Bank Telescope (pictured) in West Virginia, which the National Radio Astronomy Observatory owns . The company claims its device could 'make this necessary chore easier' and reduce the 38,000 injuries caused by walk-behind mowers each year. According to Bloomberg, iRobot claims the astronomers' concerns are exaggerated and said the chances of its gardening technology will interfere with space exploration are 'infinitesimal'. But the National Radio Astronomy Observatory argues that the frequencies iRobot wants to use are the same as they use to detect methanol – a key sign of star formation. iRobot has offered to place a notice in user manuals that states: 'Consumer use only; use must be limited to residential areas.' Researchers at the Parkes Observatory claim they have finally found the source of these 'alien' signals - in their kitchen microwave . For years, scientists have been trying to uncover the source of mysterious radio signals being picked up in Australia. Theories have ranged from evaporating black holes to extraterrestrial communication and mergers of neutron stars. Now researchers at the Parkes Observatory claim they have finally found the source of these 'alien' signals - in their kitchen microwave. Scientists knew the strange signals, known as perytons, originated somewhere near to the planet, but they had no idea just how close. The researchers were able to replicate the emission of perytons by opening the microwave door while the device was still running. Within a fraction of a second, the microwave activity was picked up by the reader and the source of the perytons revealed. 'Subsequent tests revealed that a peryton

'Manchester United is a club that means so much to me,' said Welbeck, who spent 15 years at United having joined them at eight. 'I'm a fan and it's hard to knock them out. I was just doing my job. 'It was about being professional, keeping my focus and motivation. I kept plugging away and then got on the end of Antonio Valencia's backpass, beat David de Gea and got the winning goal.

"Australia's 'tiny hearts and balls of steel', it's apparently the perfect combination in dealing with asylum seeker boats, and a policy which could be copied by Britain, according to a British commentator. Controversial The Sun columnist Katie Hopkins has heaped praise on Tony Abbott's government for its success in stopping the boats, which was a key election plank.

Controversial UK commentator Katie Hopkins has written that Australia's approach of having 'balls of steel and tiny hearts' should be followed as policy by the Brits . 'They (Australians) threaten them with violence until they bugger off, throwing cans of Castlemaine in an Aussie version of sharia stoning' said Katie Hopkins . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been 'praised' for leading the charge to stop the boats . 'Their approach to migrant boats is the sort of approach we need in the Med. 'They threaten them with violence until they bugger off, throwing cans of Castlemaine in an Aussie version of sharia stoning.' Her tone has won few friends in Europe and her timing, even less so, slammed as it coincided with the drowning of up to 900 men, women and children on a sunken fishing boat, off Italy. Hopkins went on to write: 'Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches.' 'Australians are like British people but with balls of steel, can-do brains, tiny hearts and whacking great gunships. 'And their approach is working. Migrant boats have halved in number since Prime Minister Tony Abbott got tough.' But her inflammatory remarks has led to an outcry on social media and tens of thousands joining a Change.org campaign to have her removed.

"At first their mother put it down to coincidence: one of her twins was performing tasks with her right hand, the other using her left. But when Naomi and Hannah Moxon’s baby teeth started falling out on opposite sides of their mouths, their mother Karen made a surprise discover - her girls were mirror twins. The rare condition, which is thought to occur in around 25 per cent of identical twins, refers to twins who are mirror images of one another. Scroll down for video . Mirror twins: Naomi (left) and Hannah Moxon (right) do everything the opposite way around . Sister act: Naomi (left) and Hannah Moxon (right) with their mother Karen . Like in many cases, Naomi is left handed, while Hannah writes with her right. When they eat, Naomi uses her cutlery the traditional way, while Hannah’s knife and fork are held in reverse. And their hair naturally parts on opposite sides of their heads – Hannah’s on the left, Naomi’s on the right. Yesterday the 19-year-olds, from Peterborough, who are currently competing in BBC talent show The Voice, opened up about their unusual situation. Naomi said: ‘Our mum noticed quite early on that we were doing things with the opposite hands. She would say raise the hand you use to draw and I'd raise one and Hannah would raise the other. 'Then mum mentioned it at one of our check-ups and that's when they said about mirror twins. I don’t think many people know what it is.' ‘There were other things like I use my knife and fork the wrong way round,’ Hannah added, ‘our baby teeth fell out on different sides as well, one of mine would fall out and then within a few days Naomi lost the same tooth on the other side. Also our partings are naturally opposite, although we sometimes wear it the same.’ Hannah (left) and Naomi are starring in the BBC TV show The Voice . Bundles of delight: Although identical, tiny tots Hannah and Naomi are known as mirror twins . The twins, pictured Naomi, left, and Hannah, aged two . In other respects, Hannah and Naomi are remarkably similar, made even more so by the fact they like dressing alike. They share a bedroom – and wardrobe – and they do their make-up in the same way. When they made it through the blind auditions round of The Voice as singing duo Classical Reflections, they wore matching white dresses to perform Nella Fantasia by Sarah Brightman. Hannah said: ‘We like dressing the same, but not always. It's part of our performing act. What's good is that I can ask her to try something on so I can see what it looks like. And we always talk about what suits “us” not what suits “me”.’ ‘We started off as half a person,’ Naomi joked. The pair often finish each other’s sentences, have never spent more than a few hours apart and claim to know what the other is thinking – ‘If someone’s being annoying we can share it with each other

"Scientists have discovered an Achilles’ heel of prostate (pictured) cancer that could lead to better treatment for many men diagnosed with the disease . British scientists have discovered an ‘Achilles’ heel’ in prostate cancer which could lead to better treatments. The disease claims almost 11,000 lives a year in the UK, with most deaths occurring after it spreads around the body. The latest study gets to the root of this spread, and could mean better outcomes for the 42,000 men a year diagnosed with the illness. Scientists funded by Cancer Research UK studied samples taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten affected men. Reading the DNA revealed details of how the cancer metastasises, or spreads, allowing them to build a ‘family tree’ of how the disease changes over time. It seems that most of the cells in a tumour stay where they are. However, a small number have the ability to travel through the body, creating new tumours as they go. These cells are the ‘root’ of the cancer and for a treatment to work, they should be destroyed. In future, doctors may be able to find these key cells in individual patients. They could then be given drugs to wipe them out, with each patient’s treatment tailored to the genetic flaw at the root of their cancer. This should kill the new tumours and prevent more from forming, greatly improving odds of survival. Cambridge University researcher Professor David Neal said some suitable drugs already exist, and that new ones are being developed all the time. However, he cautioned that it will be three to five years before the latest knowledge can be routinely put to use in the NHS. Lead study author Professor Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: ‘We gained a much broader view of prostate cancer by studying both the original cancer and the cells that had spread to other parts of the body. ‘We found that all of the cells that had broken free shared a common ancestor cell in the prostate. ‘The common faults we found in each man could potentially offer new targets for treatment.’ Co-author Dr Ultan McDermott, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, described the finding as a ‘potential Achilles’ heel’. Professor Peter Johnson, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This research lets us look right into the molecular core of cancer.’ Samples were taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten men with the disease (pictured). Reading the DNA revealed details of how the cancer metastasises - or spreads - allowing scientists to understand how the disease changes over time .

"Keeping boys and girls apart at school allows them to keep their ‘innocence’ for much longer, the headmaster of Eton has claimed. Tony Little said children today needed ‘pretty graphic’ sex education from just nine years old because of the pressures they encounter day-to-day. But he claimed that children are able to ‘be themselves’ until way into their teens if they are kept apart from the other sex. Eton headmaster Tony Little said children today needed ‘pretty graphic’ sex education from just nine years old because of the pressures of mixed-sex education . Speaking at an education summit in Dubai, Mr Little said: ‘What does strike me is that in a single-sex environment, particularly at the age of 13, 14, 15, there is an opportunity for both boys and girls to be themselves for longer. To be 'boyish' for longer, to be young girls. ‘One of the real challenges we face as parents and particularly in schools, and this has accelerated in the last few years, is the growing apparent sophistication of children at a younger age. ‘The need even at the age of nine now, pretty graphic sex education because of the pressures that are being put on girls particularly, from the age 11 and upwards.’ Eton - the exclusive boarding school attended by David Cameron, Boris Johnson, Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge - is an all-boys school which costs £30,000-a-year to attend . Tony Little became the first old-Etonian to take over as headmaster of the school in 50 years after being appointed in 2001. Mr Little - who was a pupil at Eton Choir School before moving on to Eton with a bursary - has been outspoken in his criticism of education standards. Last year he said exams had not changed much since Victorian times. He said they oblige students 'to sit alone at their desks in preparation for a world in which, for much of the time, they will need to work collaboratively'. Mr Little also attacked the drive to rank schools, saying: “There is more to education than league tables"". He is set to be replaced as the head of Britain's most famous school by the school's 38-year-old history teacher Simon Henderson. Mr Henderson is believed to be one of the youngest leaders in the 574-year history of the school, founded in 1440 by King Henry VI. Mr Little, who is due to step down this summer as Eton’s headmaster, said it was a ‘sad thing’ that sex education is now needed. After 13 years in the post, Mr Little is due to become chief education officer of the GEMS Education network of schools in Europe, the US and Africa. He told the Global Education and Skills Forum: ‘I guess what I'm saying is in a single sex environment, you can allow innocence to last a little longer.’ The head master claimed single sex schools like his ‘remove some of the pressures’ from children around sex and relationships. He said: ‘There are ways of talking about emotional development and about sexuality with single-gender groups, that

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League's Easter weekend fixtures and the race for promotion across the Football League. 1. Playing Jordan Henderson as a wing back instead of in his normal central midfield position was an idea that went spectacularly wrong for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. The England star, who has taken over the captain’s armband in the absence of Steven Gerrard, gave the ball away 23 times in 90 minutes as he struggled to handle the role at Arsenal. Jordan Henderson (left) toiled as a wing back in Liverpool's defeat against Arsenal and lost the ball 23 times . Henderson, usually a central midfielder, has not given the ball away as much all season for Liverpool . There hasn’t been a single one of his previous 29 Premier League appearances this season in which he’s lost possession more. 2. John O’Shea has clearly learned the canny defender’s art of letting his brain do all the running. The theory is if you get in the right position in the first place, you don’t have to chase to recover. In 90 minutes of helping Sunderland keep a clean sheet against Newcastle, the Ireland international logged just 11.9 metres at sprint speed on the EA Sports performance data. It clearly works for him – he’ll be 34 at the end of this month but remains the sole Premier League outfield player to have appeared in every minute of every game in all competitions for his club this season. John O'Shea only sprinted 11.9 metres during his impressive display in Sunderland's 1-0 win over Newcastle . O'Shea (third left) celebrated Sunderland's win with Costel Pantilimon when the final whistle was blown . For good measure he’s also completed the full 90 minutes of all five European Championship qualifiers for the Republic. 3. Steven Caulker’s form has suffered from playing with too many different partners at QPR but there are signs the former Spurs and Cardiff centre half is returning to his best. The 23-year-old was a towering figure as a West Brom side led by the powerful figure of substitute Victor Anichebe fought to recover from being three goals down at half-time. Steven Caulker (right) wins a header against West Bromwich Albion striker Brown Ideye . Caulker made 20 clearances – as many as the rest of the Rangers back four put together – and more than any other Premier League defender all weekend. 4. Chelsea need have few fears if Diego Costa’s hamstring problems mean they have to rely on Loic Remy for goals in the last eight games of the season. The France international’s tap-in from Eden Hazard’s pass for the winner against Stoke was his fifth Premier League goal of the season from just 456 minutes on the pitch. Loic Remy (centre) scored Chelsea's winner in their 2-1 victory over Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . Remy could be vital to Chelsea as they look to win the Premier League title after Diego Costa went off injured . That’s a goal every 91 minutes

"They share the bond of a grandfather and granddaughter, but in the 18 years they have known each other, have never actually met. Until now. When she was 11-years-old, New York girl Nicole - who asked that her surname not be published - was given a school assignment to write to a pen pal, with an ad placed in different newspapers calling for people in other states interested in corresponding with the students. Norman Fikes, a writer from Bastrop, Texas, came across the ad and responded, subsequently beginning an exchange that would - and continues to - last a lifetime. That was 1996, and Norman - then 61 - and his wife, Bobbie, started to eagerly await letters from their young pen pal, Nicole, KVUE TV reported. Finally: Nicole and Norman have been writing to each other for the last 18 years, but have only just met each other in the flesh in Batrop, Texas . First meal: The two decided to meet for dinner and share their first meal together. Both were in tears . Both would send photos in their letters and celebrate birthdays and holidays with each other from afar. One year Norman playfully told Nicole he wanted either a Cadillac or Rolls Royce for his birthday. Nicole then sent a toy car of each make. The couple witnessed Nicole grow up through her letters, and Norman has kept all of them, even a poem Nicole wrote for him when she was young. However, much to his dismay, Norman, now almost 80, was forced to stop writing back to Nicole recently, as his Parkinson's Disease worsens and his hands are too shaky to put pen to paper. Unwilling to be cut off from her surrogate grandparents, Nicole traveled the 1,600 miles from New York to Bastrop, to finally meet them. A reunion of sorts: Norman Fikes and his wife Bobbie (together) finally got to meet Nicole (center left) and her family, after Nicole traveled from New York to meet with the couple . Norman sat anxiously in the restaurant where they planned to meet. 'I'm so excited. I'm nervous,' he told KVUE TV. Then Nicole, now a 29-year-old woman, finally arrived. She ran in with tears streaming down her face and her arms outstretched. 'We made it,' she said. 'How are you? Can you believe it?' Norman was crying just as much. 'I've never had anybody go to this much trouble to see me before,' he said. Celebration: Together with their families, Nicole and Norman (back left) have now finally met . Once the tears stopped, the two shared their first proper conversation and meal. They have now agreed to speak over text, with Bobbie helping her husband type and read the messages. Nicole acknowledged that, with technology the way it is now, other children won't get to have an experience like she did. 'The connections you make are way more important than anything you're going to learn in a book,' she said.

"Mark Halsey, the controversial former elite referee who lost his role as a regular BT Sport pundit following Premier League upset, has had an invitation to speak to a regional referees association withdrawn following intervention from the highest level. Halsey was due to address the Sheffield Referee Association on how he beat cancer to continue as a top referee. But an objection from an unnamed football figure led to the national Referees Association persuading their Sheffield branch to embarrassingly cancel the appearance of Halsey, who was giving his services free. The email from Laura Ritchie, chairwoman of the RA, read: ‘A senior member of the footballing world has brought it to our attention that you have invited Mark Halsey to be a guest speaker. It is a worry that a figure who is being very negative about top-flight referees won’t send the right message to members. It may be perceived Sheffield RA agree with his viewpoint.’ Mark Halsey was invited to speak to the Sheffield Referee Association regarding his battle against cancer . However his planned appearance was cancelled after an unnamed football figure objected against the talk . Sheffield management then informed members: ‘There was an agreement that we cancel Mark after pressure from the national RA and the wider football world.’ And the Sheffield response to the RA said: ‘Our irritation at having been placed in this position cannot be underestimated. Are we saying that as referees, we are above criticism?’ FA refs chief David Elleray is president of the RA but on Monday night HE denied any involvement. However, Halsey’s strong views on a decline in refereeing standards is certainly born out by the widespread furore around their performances this season. BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore reacted to his perceived ‘snub’ at being one of the few TV pundits not included in ITV’s giant World Cup team by tweeting ‘I’ve been told I’m too controversial for TV World Cup coverage. Too c***, I could take but controversial, b*******.’ However, it wasn’t ITV who told Moore he is controversial. The network, happy to employ the more volatile Roy Keane as a football pundit, have had no contact with Moore. BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore vented his frustration at being snubbed by ITV on Twitter . Van Praag bid blunder . FIFA presidential candidate Michael van Praag says, if elected, he intends to cut costs — something he’s never heard mentioned during six years of dealings with Zurich, where figures are just plucked out of the air, he claimed. Van Praag will also declare what his FIFA salary would be and wants to know what Sepp Blatter has been paid. The Dutch football leader, who has a budget of €400,000 from his national association for his campaign, is also concerned at the way Fox TV were given the rights to the World Cup in 2026 without a tender to end their resistance to a World Cup in Qatar. Yet all Van Praag’s good intentions are undone by his open offer to Blatter, who he says could carry on as a working

"Trendsetter: Natalie Massenet made Net-a-Porter a global phenomenon . When Natalie Massenet set up a website selling luxury fashions 15 years ago, her critics said it would never work. But that company, Net-a-Porter.com, proved to be a huge hit – with women saving up more than £2,000 for dresses by top designers such as Valentino. Now the online firm she founded from a London flat in 2000 is about to go through a mega-merger with an Italian fashion group – netting the mother of two about £70million. The deal with Yoox, expected to be announced this week after both sides confirmed talks yesterday, will make the business worth £1billion. It is a remarkable success story for UK-based Miss Massenet, who is credited with changing the way women shop for high-end fashion. Her website has become a global phenomenon, reaching sales of more than £500million and spawning copycat sites across the world. The daughter of a British Chanel model, the 49-year-old former fashion magazine journalist set up her online business just as the dotcom crash hit in 2000. Aged just 33 and struggling to get any funding, she eventually managed to raise just over a million in start-up capital from her Chelsea flat. She launched the business with her then husband Arnaud while pregnant with her first child, despite warnings from sceptics who thought women would refuse to buy expensive clothes without trying them on. But the site has been a huge hit with the wealthy as well as those who simply live a long way from London’s designer shops and save for months for an item. Top-end products on the site include a JW Anderson leather panelled mini dress for £1,350 and a black silk satin jacket by Givenchy for £2,675. Miss Massenet, who split from her husband in 2011 after 15 years of marriage, has since expanded the company into menswear with a site called Mr Porter and a discount site called the Outnet.com. She is due to receive the fruits of the mega-merger, which analysts say will bring a range of benefits, once the deal is finalised. She is expected to receive more than £70million on top of the £50million she made from selling the business to current owner, Swiss luxury giant Richemont, in 2010. That deal valued the business at £280million. The merger with Yoox, which sells overstocked or unsold designer goods from previous seasons, values it at a staggering £1billion. Catwalk creations: The latest clothing designs on the website . California-born Miss Massenet, who is currently the chairman of the British Fashion Council, may stay on in her role as chairman of the business. She worked for US magazine Women's Wear Daily and later became an assistant to stylist and fashion muse Isabella Blow at Tatler. Net-a-Porter is famous for its plush back and cream ribbon-wrapped delivery boxes, with designer items lovingly wrapped in crisp tissue paper. During the financial crisis women who were unable to give up their Net-a-Porter habit asked for their purchases to be delivered in plain wrapping, to hide their extravagance from colleagues.

"(CNN)About 20 hours after the Boston Marathon started Monday, many of the cheering crowds had dispersed and the streets were cleared. But one man, despite the odds against him, crossed the finish line. Venezuelan native Maickel Melamed, who is battling muscular dystrophy, completed the 26.2 miles just before 5 a.m. Tuesday. A group of energized fans rallied for the 39-year-old as he walked down Boylston Street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation, Vamos. He was the last participant to complete the race, CNN affiliate WCVB-TV reported. Friends who were waiting for Melamed to cross the finish line said the university professor and motivational speaker is dedicated and motivated. ""He wants to show that life is great, no matter how many problems you can have,"" friend Perla Sananes said. Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking. Melamed has completed marathons in Chicago, New York, Berlin and Tokyo. Boston has a special place in his heart because his parents brought him to the city as a baby, WCVB-TV said. His perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line Tuesday morning, and also by fans online. Melamed is one of about 30,000 participants who raced in this year's marathon, which comes less than two weeks after a jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 charges related to the 2013 Boston bombings. On social media Monday, spectators cheered for runners and the city, calling the marathon a symbol of strength and unity.

"A breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power, scientists claim. At the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Hydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily . Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention. It uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. Lead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces. Water splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively. The energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two. The new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process. It can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner. The process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost. With this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency. ‘Oxygen is the most difficult bit,’ Dr Hintermair explained. Their catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn’t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is ‘almost non-existent’. The major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. ‘We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can’t store it very well,’ Dr Hintermair continued. ‘We can put it in a battery but you can’t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet. ‘So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.’ This, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical. On this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen . The team are in discussions with

"A Dutch mother has abducted two of her four children and taken them to join militants fighting for the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Syria. The unnamed 32-year-old Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa. The father of the missing children named the pair as Luca, seven, and his sister Aysha, eight, and said they had been taken without his consent. The woman's two other children are believed to have been handed over to a relative before she left to join the terror group. Abducted: The father of the missing children named the pair as 'Luca', seven, (left) and his sister 'Aysha', eight, (right) and said they had been taken without his consent . The missing woman, who has not yet been named, fled the Netherlands with two of her children last October, the Dutch prosecution's office confirmed this morning. Snatched: Eight-year-old Dutch girl 'Aysha' was abducted by her mother and taken to join ISIS . It is the first known instance of children in the Netherlands being abducted and taken to join ISIS. According to the Dutch newspaper De Limburger, the children's father had previously reported his estranged wife to the police because he was concerned she was planning to travel to Syria. Officers are said to have questioned the woman several times but she denied having intentions to join ISIS and investigators could find no evidence of concrete travel plans. Shortly afterwards the woman vanished from Maastricht with two of the children, prompting Dutch officials to launch a major alert, leading to an international arrest warrant being issued. Despite this the woman later took to Facebook to declare that she and her two children had arrived in the terrorists' de facto capital Raqqa, having used fake passports to travel across Europe. After making the announcement of their arrival in Raqqa on Facebook last October, nothing has been heard from the trio since. Dutch officials said they had no way of telling whether the group were still alive, with prosecutor Bart den Hartigh declaring the recovery of the children 'impossible' as the Netherlands has no legal relationship with either the Syrian regime or the terror group that controls the city of Raqqa. No place for children: The unnamed 32-year-old Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa (pictured) The news comes as an 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State. West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham, was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. It comes the day after it three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, in a dramatic security operation. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Istanbul

Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively that Phillip 'Donnie' Phillips and his wife Sheryl filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on September 19th in Georgia Federal Court. The court documents state they have a total of $290,445 in assets - but owe $304,295 to creditors. Mr and Mrs Phillips, both 61, ran their own pawn shop for 24 years, however they sold it off in 2012 after defaulting on payments. Singer songwriter Phillip, 24, worked at the family business before winning American Idol - but just a few months later failed to step in to save it. Scroll down for video . Idolized: Phillip's proud parents Phillip Sr and Sheryl were by his side as he sang his heart out to win the 11th Season of American Idol. He took the audience home to Georgia, where his father owned the pawn shop . The Phillips family home in Leesburg, Georgia . Court documents obtained by Daily Mail Online show that his parents' financial woes continued to spiral while he amassed reported net earnings of $5 million in 2013 alone. Mr and Mrs Phillips have refused to lift the lid on the rumored family rift, however, and say they don't blame him for their money troubles. 'He's a good son, he's there for us,"" Mrs Phillips told Daily Mail Online from the doorstep of their family home in Leesburg, just outside Albany, Georgia. 'There's no rift - in fact I've just come off the phone to him. The couple's debt includes $204,000 owed to the bank for four Georgia commercial properties, including a mobile home, $78,000 on their single-story family home and $3,400 for a Hilton Head timeshare. The family sporting goods and pawn shop closed . They also owe nearly $1,000 in medical bills, over $5,000 in credit card debt and $1,279 for dental services. Both list themselves as unemployed although Sheryl brings in $1,822 from pension income and they get $700 in help from family members. The pair, who also have a 37-year-old daughter named La Donna who founded the non-profit group Mission Change, only have $30 left after paying their monthly bills. Their former family business, Albany Sporting Goods and Pawn, was sold off at a public liquidation auction in December 2012. It took place just a month after Phillips released his platinum-selling debut album, The World from the Side of the Moon. Several of the star's guitars were among the lots, along with a trove of signed pictures, CDs, posters and even the framed American Idol tickets that his parents used to attend the FOX talent show. Mr Phillips said he was looking to retire but subsequent reports suggested the building and its inventory was sold to pay off mounting debts.

"Claims that Tiger Woods is serving a one-month suspension - rebutted by the player's agent and the PGA Tour - have been withdrawn. Woods is taking an indefinite break from golf as he attempts to get his game 'tournament ready' after a poor run of form and injuries. Former Tour player Dan Olsen, who played in 35 Tour events between 1989 and 2011 - missing 22 cuts - alleged in an interview on US radio station 730AM The Game on Friday that Woods was serving a drugs ban, but on Monday retracted his claims and issued an apology to the 14-time major winner. Dan Olsen had alleged in a radio interview that Tiger Woods (pictured) was serving a one month suspension . Olsen has since apologised to Woods and to the PGA Tour for the comments he made . 'I retract the entire interview,' Olsen said in a statement on the radio station's website. 'My comments were ill-advised. I want to apologise to Nike, the PGA Tour, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and (Tour commissioner) Tim Finchem.' The allegations had brought a strong denial from the PGA, with PGA Tour executive vice-president and chief marketing officer Ty Votaw issuing a statement. 'There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,' it read. 'We categorically deny these allegations.' Woods' agent Mark Steinberg also quashed the allegations, labelling them 'unequivocally and completely false'. 14-time major championship winner Woods, pictured here in June 2013 at Merion Golf Club, hopes to reclaim his world No 1 status from Rory McIlory when he returns to the sport . 'These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,' he said. 'They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. 'The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.' Woods has not played since he withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open at the start of February, less than a week after firing a career-worst round of 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. No date has been set for the 39-year-old's return, with the Masters at Augusta starting on April 9. Woods is currently dating USA skiing superstar Lindsey Vonn, with the pair pictured together here in 2013 . Woods is currently on a hiatus from golf in order to recover from injuries and a dip in his form .

"A morbidly obese man has started documenting his efforts to lose more than 300lbs - without weight loss surgery - after the intense back pain brought on by his size prompted him to get serious about his health. For years, Iowa-based writer Daniel P. Finney, ignored that at 563lbs he was severely overweight - even shrugging off strangers who called him 'fatty' as he walked down the street. But after a series of health issues, the 39-year-old became inspired to shed more than half of his body weight the natural way and chronicle his journey for The Des Moines Register. 'I know I'm responsible for my actions,' the columnist wrote for the newspaper's website. 'And I'm the only person who can really fix the problem.' Scroll down for video. Weight loss journey: Daniel P. Finney, 39, of Iowa, is sharing his efforts to lose over 300lbs; he started out weighing 563lbs and has lost 20lbs in a month . Daniel shared that he has been overweight since high school, and over the years has gotten used to the fact that he doesn't fit into seats at most public venues or booths at restaurants. As one of 79 million obese Americans, he has also become accustomed to the emotional pain of being called 'fatty' and getting verbally abused by strangers. In fact, even a diagnosis of Type II diabetes didn't alarm him enough to change his habits, and other health issues, like regularly pulling muscles in his calves, became a way of life. It wasn't until a combination of intense lower back pain - caused by carrying groceries, since Daniel said he can't carry anything that weighs much more than a magazine - and trouble sleeping led him to see a doctor. 'The pain had reached a point where I was practically immobile,' he said, adding that he could walk only 150 feet before he would have to stop. That's when an X-ray showed him that he also had arthritis and a narrowing of his spinal cavity. His doctor referred him to the Mercy Weight Loss Clinic in West Des Moines, Iowa. Now, Daniel is working with a therapist to tackle his emotional eating issues, as well as a nutritionist and a physical therapist. He also uses a calorie-counting app on his phone to track his eating, but admitted that even though he is serious about losing weight, making major lifestyle changes isn't easy. 'I don't know if I want to go through the rest of my life eating a leaf of kale and two scoops of vitamin supplements and sipping a thimble of water,' he said. 'The thought terrifies me of no more pizza, nachos, chicken wings, Mountain Dew or fries.' But he is still determined to try to lose over 300lbs the old-fashioned way, rather than go under the knife. If he chose to have gastric sleeve surgery, which makes the stomach smaller and reduces the hormones that produce cravings, he could lose as much as 60 per cent of his excess weight in a year - but Daniel said he

"A missing schoolgirl was murdered by a 60-year-old man who called police two weeks prior to the killing to see how officers would react to her disappearance, a jury heard today. Robert Ewing, 60, was said to have had an 'inappropriate sexual interest' in 15-year-old Paige Chivers and took advantage of her 'chaotic and dysfunctional' upbringing which had left her 'very troubled and vulnerable'. He is accused of murdering the schoolgirl, from Blackpool, Lancashire, between August 23 and August 27, 2007. Scroll down for video . Robert Ewing, 60, is accused of murdering 15-year-old Paige Chivers (pictured left as a young schoolgirl and right aged 15) after she disappeared from her family home in Blackpool, Lancashire, in August 2007 . Police investigate a site in Thornton Cleveleys in Lancashire during an earlier search for Paige's body . Paige was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home and, despite appeals from police and a £12,000 reward offer from TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle, no trace of her has ever been found. Ewing was arrested in connection with her disappearance in September last year and is currently on trial at Preston Crown Court. The jury was told today how he allegedly rang police anonymously less than a fortnight before she went missing to tell officers that a 'problem child' had turned up on his doorstep having been thrown out by her father. Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, told jurors that the Crown Prosecution Service believes he did so to 'test the water'. He told the court: 'We allege that he wanted to see what official reaction there would be to the suggestion of a 15-year-old girl turning up on the doorstep of a 52-year-old man and the answer he learned, we suggest, was very little reaction.' The court also heard how eight months after the schoolgirl's disappearance, Ewing's friend, Gareth Dewhurst, 46, was overheard in conversation saying he had used his car to dump the teenager's body. Mr Cummings said: 'He then went on to say: ""I didn't want to have sex with her, they made me"".' The prosecutor said a 'highly stoned' Dewhurst told a 16-year-old boy that Ewing had killed Paige and had then made him have sex with her before forcing him to use his car to dispose of her body. Mr Cummings said: 'He (Dewhurst) said that he had put the body in the boot and was saying that he was going to set his car on fire. He was frightened that he was going to get arrested, or that Bob (Ewing) would kill him.'

"(CNN)When I was a child, a pale specter used to call our house most evenings, eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns. We called her the ""White Bread Lady,"" a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread. She wasn't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread. No, she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision. Although we all laughed at the time, it was with a bit of shifty-eyed shame. Because most of us (including if not particularly the illustrious Ehrlich family) have lurking within us our very own ""White Bread Lady,"" ready to convince us that each cough, sniffle and less-than-nutritious meal might be a detriment to our health. And, naturally, that White Bread Lady looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information. Yup, so quoth Google, we all have cancer. According to the Pew Research Center, 80% of Internet users have looked up health information online.

"(CNN)Just about now, North Korea's enigmatic ruler was expected to be preparing to emerge from his fortified country for a visit to Moscow to join celebrations next week marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. The trip was highly anticipated. After all, this was to have been Kim's first official international trip since he came to power in 2011 following his father's death, and it would have provided a fascinating opportunity for the world to get a closer look at a young leader and a regime still largely shrouded in mystery. But this week, Russia announced that the trip had been canceled, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Thursday that Moscow was informed via diplomatic channels that the trip would not happen. He said that ""the decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs."" What could have changed Kim's mind? It is practically impossible to answer the question with absolute certainty, but a possible explanation is that Kim may not be feeling completely secure in his position. And nervous dictators prefer to stay home. True, Kim runs one of the most brutally repressive regimes on Earth. And there is unceasing public praise for the younger 'Dear Leader,"" including frenzied eruptions of support. But these eruptions are carefully scripted, and those who have managed to flee the North confirm that in private, many are unhappy with the regime. Perhaps with the potential threats in mind, Kim feels the need to reassert his authority and keep his eye on the centers of power. In 2013, Kim shocked the country and stunned outside observers when he ordered the killing of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who had stood by his side from the day his father died. Jang had mentored and guided the young Kim as he took the reins, but the once-powerful Jang was arrested by soldiers during a Politburo meeting who dragged him away in a chilling scene broadcast on national television. The central news agency called Jang a ""traitor for all the ages,"" with vague accusations that he had behaved ""insolently."" More seriously, he was accused of ""counter-revolutionary factional acts in a bid to overthrow the leadership."" And just this week, and only a day before the Russians announced Kim's canceled travel plans, a South Korea lawmaker revealed that South Korea's National Intelligence Service had pieced together information suggesting that so far this year, Kim has ordered the execution of 15 senior government officials. According to South Korean legislator Shing Kyung-min, North Korea's vice chairman of the State Planning Commission, for example, was executed because he objected to plans to change the design of a new government hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower. Such an explanation is bizarre. And in keeping with the odd behavior we have grown accustomed to hearing about from North Korea. But there may be more to this. Kim -- who was still in his 20s when he took power and holds a host of titles, including Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army -- still finds it

"Child benefit could be limited to only three children, under plans being considered by the Tories. The proposals will only hit babies born after the law has been changed and could save the Government £300million a year. At the moment there are around 320,000 families with four or more children. The Chancellor George Osborne is resisting proposals from the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to cap child benefit at three children . Child benefit is paid to families with children under 16 – or under 20 if they are in education or training. But since 2013 families with one parent earning more than £50,000 a year have been excluded from claiming the benefit. It currently pays £20.50 a week for a first child, then £13.55 for other children. James Browne, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the move would eventually save hundreds of millions of pounds – but not for another 18 years because it only affects babies born after the law is changed. Child benefit is paid families with children under 16 - or under 20 if they are in education or training - and is worth £20.50 a week for a first child, then £13.55 for other children. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has previously proposed a two-child limit, but George Osborne is understood to have rejected it. The Treasury is now ‘softening’ to the idea and is examining the details. Tory MP Dominic Raab said it was not purely about cost but could ‘send a message about personal responsibility’. He said: ‘There is a much broader point than just the financial bean counting,’ he said. ‘It's the kind of welfare system we want - do we want a social safety net or are we saying that welfare is somehow a lifestyle choice? ‘And I think we do want the welfare system to send a message about personal responsibility, and yes that includes parents saving and taking some responsibility for the size of their family, making sure it's according to their means.’ But Labour MP Dame Anne Begg said people did not have children for child benefit and asked ‘why pick on’ large families. She said: ‘I don't think you have a child because you're going to get an extra... £13.55 a week.’ Dame Anne added: ‘Only one in seven families have three or more children - it's a small number - so why pick on them?’

"The award ceremony at Crufts was overshadowed by a protester who ran onto the stage as the winner of Best in Show was presented with the trophy after a competition of seemingly never-ending drama. As Rebecca Cross and her Scottish terrier Knopa were handed the trophy at the prestigious dog show, the suited man charged in front of the winning pair, holding aloft a sign which read 'Mutts Against Crufts'. The demonstrator was quickly hauled off stage by four members of security as the shocked crowd watched in astonishment, eventually leaving owner Ms Cross and Knopa to enjoy their victory. Top dog: Rebecca Cross and Scottish terrier Knopa won the Best in Show category after earlier winning the terrier group . Barking mad: The glitzy award ceremony at Crufts was tarnished by a protester who ran onto the stage as the winner of Best in Show was presented with her trophy . The demonstrator smirked as he was hauled off stage by four members of security as the shocked crowd watched in astonishment . The protest is the second controversy to hit this year's Crufts, with an owner claiming that her prize-winning red setter was poisoned. Dee Milligan-Bott said her dog, known by its competing name Thendara Satisfaction, collapsed and died on Friday and she believes the three-year-old must have been poisoned at the competition the day before. And just when it seemed the dog show could not get any more dramatic, it emerged that winning owner Ms Cross almost did not make the grand finale after her flight from America was delayed. According to Dogs in the News, the proud owner said: 'I can’t believe it, I am in complete shock. I almost didn’t make it, my flight was delayed, and I thought I wouldn’t make it in time. 'Knopa is one in a million. She was Best of Breed here in 2013 and it’s been a really wild ride. It hasn’t sunk in yet, I really can’t believe it. She was supposed to retire today so if so this was her retirement show.' Ms Cross and Knopa, who was bred the U.S. under Russian owners and competes under the name McVan’s to Russia With Love, had earlier won the terrier group before taking the Best in Show award. The Scottish terrier, who is the first of its breed to be crowned top dog since 1929, beat Dublin, a flat coated retriever, into a well-earned second place.

"A lesbian couple in North Carolina who documented how they created their new family in a series of online pictures say they are shocked but thankful after people said the catalogue of images were an 'inspiration'. In order to start their new family, the moms, Melanie and Vanessa Iris Roy, decided to each carry a child one year apart. They took photos at each stage of their respective pregnancies, recording when their first child, a son Jax, was born followed by their daughter Ero, a year later. The couple then uploaded the images to Instagram and they quickly went viral - their young family becoming an unexpected internet sensation almost overnight. Scroll down for video . Inspirational: Melanie (left) and Vanessa Iris Roy (right) decided they wanted to start a famiy and each carried a child.

The women say they are shocked and overwhelmed at the support their photos have garnered online, after each documented their pregnancy . 'It's crazy to see that people were referring to my family as an inspiration,' Melanie told The Huffington Post. 'We are still in complete shock.' The pictures show the women together when each one is pregnant, in a series of snaps that show how they supported eachother as their bodies - and their family - changed. Other photos show them with one child when the other is expecting, and then with their family of four. Each wanted to be mothers, so they said said the decision to create their family of four was an easy one. The Roys hope by sharing the experience they would inspire other same sex couples to start a family. Melanie added: 'The woman's body is incredible. The way it creates and grows another human being is amazing. We hope that our picture is that sign that some women may need to encourage them to carry a child.' Each of the women said they hope the pictures will inspire others to start a family and celebrate how the body changes during pregnancy . The young family of four recently moved to Charlotte in North Carolina and said the attention has been overwhelming and surprising . The women did not elaborate on how each of them conceived. In January 2014 Vanessa was pregnant with Jax and just 12 months later Melanie was carrying Ero. They were photographed exactly a year apart and then uploaded the photos to Instagram earlier this year. When the photos became popular - reaching over 150,000 likes on the Facebook page of a Brazilian advocacy group alone - Melanie took to her own page to say thank you.

"An Iditarod sled dog who escaped from handlers in Anchorage has been found safe after being on the run for a month. Alaskan Husky, Sarabi, was returned to a friend of the musher Laura Allaway, on Monday night who will be reunited with the animal on April 28 when she returns from traveling. The three-year-old dog was spotted on April 15 near Glenn Highway and then again last Friday near Reverend Tim Carrick's United Protestant Presbyterian Church before being caught on Monday night, according to KTUU. Carrick and his family set up a cage trap in the woods between the church and his home, and used four bowls of dog kibbles, a pot of chicken stock, liverwurst and a motion activated camera to help capture Sarabi. Idiatrod sled dog Sarabi escaped from handlers in Anchorage but has been found safe a month after running away (Sarabi pictured above) Sarabi was dropped from musher Laura Allaway's team (Allaway pictured left) during the Iditarod on March 21.

"Teenagers as young as 16 in Birmingham have undergone weight loss surgery (file picture) Obese teenagers as young as 16 have had NHS-funded gastric band operations, worrying new figures show. And in a four-year period, the number of people aged under 30 receiving weight loss surgery in Birmingham more than doubled. Gastric band and gastric bypass operations are only carried out on the NHS when a patient's life is deemed to be at risk. Such surgery is a last resort, and before it is considered a patient is asked to make drastic changes to their lifestyle to try and lose weight naturally. The guidelines are such that a 5ft 5ins child will not be considered eligible for the drastic procedure unless they weigh at least 15 stone. Meanwhile someone who is 5ft 8ins would need to weigh almost 17 stone before they can be given the go-ahead for surgery. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre released under the Freedom of Information Act show in the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery. These included two 16 year olds, two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds. Overall between 2008-09 and 2011-12 the numbers of the radical operations performed on the under 30s rose from 35 to 71 - a 102 per cent increase. It comes as new figures this weekend revealed hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year. Since 2011, 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese - weighing 9lb 15oz or more, a Freedom of Information request revealed. Last year it emerged that West Midlanders are the second fattest group in the whole country, with NHS England figures revealing 65.7 per cent of people are overweight or obese. New figures released in January this year highlighted the worrying news that almost four out of 10 children in Birmingham are officially classed as overweight or obese by the age of 11. Concerns have been raised that people are opting for stomach surgery as an 'easy option' rather than go to the trouble of changing their lifestyle, eating more healthily and taking exercise. NHS guidelines state that surgery can only be offered when the patient has 'life threatening obesity' - a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above, or a BMI of 35 with other serious health conditions that could be improved through weight loss, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. The policy states: 'It is always recommended that patients try to lose weight through a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and increased exercise before you consider weight loss surgery, as surgery carries a risk of complications and requires a significant change in lifestyle afterwards. 'Due to these associated risks, most surgeons, whether they are working privately or for the NHS, would only consider a person for surgery if there was a clinical need, and not just for cosmetic reasons.' People can also opt to pay for weight loss surgery privately. A gastric band operation, which reduces the size of the stomach, costs up to £8,000. Meanwhile, a full

"Cissy Houston has broken her silence on the condition of her comatose granddaughter Bobbi Kristina to reveal the 21-year-old is not showing any signs of improvement. Despite having been transferred last week to a Georgia rehabilitation facility, Whitney Houston's 81-year-old mother told New York's WBLS radio that little has changed in Bobbi Kristina's condition. 'She's the same,' Cissy said. 'We've moved her to a place for rehabilitation. And you know, still not a great deal of hope.' Not much hope: Cissy Houston has broken her silence on the condition of her comatose granddaughter Bobbi Kristina to reveal the 21-year-old is not showing any signs of improvement . 'She's the same,' Cissy said. 'We've moved her to a place for rehabilitation. And you know, still not a great deal of hope.' Moved: Brown, the daughter of late pop singer Whitney Houston, was moved to a rehabilitation facility from a Georgia hospital almost two months after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub . 'The family had for weeks stayed mostly mum about Bobbi's condition Houston also took the time to thank fans who'd been praying for Bobbi since she was found unresponsive in a bathtub of her Georgia home January 31. 'I feel every bit of it,' she said. 'I truly do.' Houston said: 'I'm asking everybody: ""Just pray to the Lord who we know CAN do something about it.""' Brown, the daughter of late pop singer Whitney Houston, was moved to a rehabilitation facility from a Georgia hospital almost two months after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub, NBC News reported on last week. Family members, including Bobby's son Landon and Whitney's sister-in-law Pat Houston, lent their support during the transfer, with Pat seen carrying items including stuffed toys and books. Doctors at Emory attempted to slowly remove life support to see if Bobbi responded but unfortunately it was to no avail and sources have confirmed she is in the same non-responsive state she's been in for weeks. The new facility is said to be better for long-term care. Bobby reportedly remains confident that his daughter can come out of the coma even though doctors have told the family to prepare for the worst. Bobbi was taken to North Fulton Hospital in Roswell, Georgia after being resuscitated on January 31 and was later transferred to Emory Hospital where she had been until this week. Meanwhile, according to Radar Online, R&B star Bobby 'wants god to make the decision' of whether to take his daughter off life support and is 'devastated' that he is going to have to make this decision about his child.

"A New York man who became known as the 'Cannibal Cop' wants to give the public a taste of what's really going on inside his mind. In the HBO documentary Thought Crimes which premiered on Thursday at Tribeca Film Festival, Valle talks about his 2012 arrest and the claims that allegedly plotted to kidnap, torture, and eat his wife and other women online. For those hungry to learn about Valle and his stomach-churning fantasies, the film will also be shown on HBO in May. Scroll down for video . Thought Crimes :In the HBO documentary Thought Crimes 'cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle talks about his 2012 arrest and the claims that allegedly plotted to kidnap, torture, and eat women online . Family time: Gilberto Valle, often at his mother's house, is seen cooking in the film but he's only making bacon and eggs and he makes jokes about people feeling afraid when they see him with a fork . Months before his arrest in late 2012, Gilberto Valle, then a New York police officer, sat at his computer, hiding behind fictional online identities and exchanging messages about murdering and eating women . 'When you’re behind a computer screen late at night, no one knows who you are, where you are,' Valle says in the opening of the documentary. 'I became part of this cyber-community, where people are exploring deviant thoughts and exploring their fetishes,' he added. 'And then you shut the computer off, and that’s it. I go back to being the regular me. But someone might say the anonymous nature could also bring out who you really are. In my worst nightmare, I could never guess that this would have happened.' Valle, often at his mother's house, is seen cooking in the film but he's only making bacon and eggs. 'Nobody’s alarmed I have a fork in my hand with people around? Everybody's good?' Valle asks at one point when sitting down to eat. Valle insists throughout the film that he never intended to actually hurt anyone. He says he just has dark fantasies. 'This was something that was private, anonymous, it was a little bit of a skeleton in my closet,' Valle says, brushing off his dark thoughts. The New York Daily News reports that the director of the film Erin Lee Carr said that she wanted to portray Valle in as neutral of a light as possible. Originally convicted: Former New York City police officer Gilberto Valle, dubbed by local media as the 'Cannibal Cop' after a guilty verdict was delivered at his trial as seen in this courtroom sketch . 'He wanted me to paint a portrait of him as an American family man and I couldn’t do that,' Carr said. 'I could portray him as someone you could try and understand.' Carr is the daughter of New York Times columnist David Carr who died in February. In the film Valle's father, Gilberto Valle Sr., says his son was guilty of being an imaginative writer. 'He created a monster. He’s a good writer,' he says. At the end of

"A primary school teaching assistant has been suspended after a colleague discovered white powder in her bag and reported it to the police. It has been reported that Lisa Heath, 45, an assistant at Willowtown Community Primary School in Gwent, had been carrying Class B amphetamines after police were called and quizzed her. She initially denied the drugs were hers, saying they had been planted on her, but later changed her story, accepting a caution for possession. Lisa Heath, 45, an assistant at Willowtown Community Primary School, Gwent (pictured), admitted carrying a Class B drug on the premises and has now been suspended from teaching . A spokesman for the school told The Sun that Miss Heath had been suspended, adding that she was being dealt with 'through the appropriate internal channels.' Gwent Police confirmed its officers were called to the school in Ebbw Vale on March 19 after receiving reports a controlled substance had been discovered on the premises. A police spokesperson added: 'A 45 year old woman voluntarily attended Tredegar Police Station where she received a caution for possession of a controlled substance (class B).' Blaenau Gwent Council has confirmed that the school immediately suspended the member of staff following the incident. A spokeswoman for the local authority said: 'We take such incidents extremely seriously and this matter is now being dealt with by the school and its governing body, together with support from the council, through the proper internal procedures. We are unable to comment further.' The maximum penalty for possession of amphetamines is 5 years in prison plus a fine. For supply the penalty is up to 14 years imprisonment and a fine. If the amphetamines are prepared for injection they become class A drugs and increased penalties apply. There is no indication this was the case with Ms Heath. When a reporter from the paper went to Ms Heath's home, a man claiming to be her son emerged and denied that she had been suspended or found with drugs. Most amphetamines (pictured), a form of chemical stimulant, are Class B drugs, meaning the maximum penalty for possession is five years in jail plus a fine . He also threatened to attack anyone going near the property with a hammer. Willowtown has 379 pupils aged between three and 11 years old, with 15 full-time members of staff, supported by four part-time teachers. Ebbw Vale, the area in which the school is located, is among the most deprived in Wales, and a third of the pupils qualify for free school meals, above the Welsh average of around 20 per cent.

"(CNN)All you need is luck, to misquote one of Liverpool's most famous exports, The Beatles. But Liverpool's footballers won't mind one bit that a fortunate goal sealed a vital win at Swansea to set up a pivotal clash with Manchester United at the weekend. One of English soccer's biggest rivalries is renewed on Sunday with vital points at stake in the race for a place in next season's European Champions League. Jordan Henderson knew little about his winner in Wales, the ball flying in after Jordi Amat's clearance struck him, but it helped make it seven wins out of eight for the Reds. A sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home pulled it within two points of Manchester United in fourth, with just four points separating Liverpool from Manchester City in second. ""It's a great result,"" Henderson told Sky Sports. ""The first half was disappointing but I felt as though we did better in second half, passed the ball and created a few chances. ""It was a great pass by Daniel, I got a little fortunate with the finish but you've got to be in the right position to score. ""Overall we're delighted with three points and we now look forward to Sunday. We can't wait for it, we are high on confidence and have great momentum but United played well the other day. ""It'll be a tough one but at Anfield we go in confident and hopefully we'll get the result we need."" In a lackluster start, Daniel Sturridge dragged a shot wide of post for Liverpool before England international Adam Lallana fired a fierce half-volley right at Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. From then on Swansea asserted control. Martin Skrtel had to be alert to clear as Swansea's French striker Bafetimbi Gomis -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at Tottenham earlier this month -- headed at goal. Gomis then played a neat one-two with Wayne Routledge before forcing Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet into a fine low save. Next to threaten Liverpool's net was Iceland international Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose effort was arrowing for the top corner before Mignolet intervened. Just before halftime Jonjo Shelvey, a former Liverpool player, went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by Alberto Moreno. But having had a chance to regroup, Liverpool came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot. First Fabianski made a brilliant save to keep out Philippe Coutinho's near post effort before the Pole was then in action again to deny Joe Allen. Though Liverpool were in the ascendency, its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck. As Henderson galloped onto a through ball Swansea's Spanish defender Amat got there first, but his clearance ricocheted off the Liverpool player and into the net past Fabianski. From then on Liverpool did a fine job of squeezing the life out of the game and playing on the counter, striker Daniel Sturridge hitting the post late on as Swansea left gaps at the back. Reading seal Wembley berth .

"Frank Lampard has no regrets over delaying his move to New York City FC – but has already pencilled in the date when he faces Steven Gerrard for the first time. The Manchester City midfielder was expected to join the club's sister outfit for their maiden MLS season which kicked off earlier this month. But in a controversial move which angered many of the new franchise's supporters, he extended his stay at the Etihad Stadium to the end of the season as Manuel Pellegrini's men attempt to retain their Premier League title. Frank Lampard delayed his move to New York City FC to see out the season with Manchester City . The former Chelsea legend has no regrets in controversially putting off his move to the MLS . Lampard's decision has been questioned after starting only two games for City in 2015 . With Lampard's former club Chelsea now six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand, and having started just two matches since the turn of the year, some have questioned the logic behind the decision. But the veteran midfielder, who won 11 trophies in a glittering 13 years at Stamford Bridge, has no such thoughts. 'I’m very fortunate,' he said. 'This part of my career, coming to City, was something I never saw coming and when I look back and think, blimey, at 36 I got asked to come to the champions and a club with this pedigree of player here. 'I’m delighted that happened as it has done and I’m delighted with the future I’ ve got and the opportunity to go on and play in New York and individually try to help there, but also be part of a new football club in one of the greatest cities in the world.'

Lampard will join former Spain and Barcelona star David Villa (centre) at his new club . Former England team-mate Steven Gerrard will also head across the Atlantic at the end of the season to join rivals LA Galaxy. And Lampard is relishing the prospect of facing his old pal - when asked when the match takes place he was quick to answer. 'August 23,' he said without hesitation. 'It’s at their place.

Lampard believes Liverpool legend Gerrard, 34, has made the right call to follow him to the US after 17 years in the first team at Anfield.

"Con Edison found a 'hazardous situation' in August in one of the three buildings that was destroyed in an explosion and fire in Manhattan's East Village last week. Utility workers dispatched in August found 'dangerous gas line connections' after a Con Edison worker reading gas meters smelled gas, according to a Con Edison spokesman. The worker smelled gas on August 6 in the basement of the building that exploded at 121 Second Avenue on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Photographs show the three buildings that entirely collapsed following the East Village explosion last week . Firefighters kept blasting water at pockets of flames among the rubble on Friday as it continued to smoulder . Cars were flattened by the debris as the three buildings collapsed overnight following the explosion . When they were at the building in August, the utility workers found 'multiple leaks' in hoses that were connected to the gas line, the New York Times reported. The company spokesman said Con Edison shut off the building's gas for about ten days, until it was determined to be safe. The owner of Sushi Park, the restaurant where the explosion occurred, told the Times that utility workers determined that gas intended for his restaurant was being siphoned off illegally for use in newly-renovated apartments upstairs. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that the blast was possibly tied to someone 'inappropriately' tapping into a gas line. An hour before the blast, Con Edison utility inspectors had been at the scene and determined that pre-existing work was not satisfactory, but the problems were not safety related, the mayor said. A general contractor who went to check out the gas leak report as Sushi Park was one of 50 people arrested in February in a sweep of the city by building and housing inspectors. Dilber Kukic was accused of bribing an undercover investigator to dismiss violations at two properties, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said.

"Celtic have announced that they are to erect a bronze statue of Billy McNeill to mark the magnificent achievements of the club's greatest ever captain. The statue will be positioned on the recently opened Celtic Way and will represent a man who is synonymous with the club and someone who represented them with true distinction as both a player and manager. As a player, McNeill won nine consecutive league championship titles, seven Scottish Cups, six League Cups and, of course, he was the first British team captain to lift the European Cup in 1967. Celtic legend BIlly McNeill poses with the European Cup to commemorate the club's famous 1967 victory . He was named the Scottish Footballer of the Year in season 1964-65, the first ever winner of the award. As manager, McNeill delivered four league championship titles, three Scottish Cups and he lifted the League Cup once. As both player and manager, he enjoyed a 27-year association with Celtic Football Club. Fittingly, the work on the statue will be carried out by John McKenna, the sculptor who recently completed the statue of Jock Stein which sits at the entrance to Celtic Park. Work on the statue of McNeill will begin immediately and it is hoped that the completed work will be unveiled at Celtic Park later this year, around Autumn. McNeill (right) has a shot blocked by Leeds United midfielder Paul Madeley (left) Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell said: 'Growing up in the 1960s and 1970s as a Celtic supporter, Billy McNeill was an inspiration to me and someone of huge stature in the game, not only on the field but also off it, as a statesman, a leader and a figurehead for our great club. 'His achievements for Celtic are simply outstanding and across a period of 27 years he gave so much to the club. 'It is a privilege to now know Billy, and consider him as a friend. He is someone who commands the respect of everyone across the entire footballing spectrum. 'We are delighted already to have Billy as our Ambassador at the club but the Board felt unanimously that he should recognised in this way, given all that he has contributed to Celtic over so many years. 'We look forward to the unveiling of the statue, which we are sure will be a great tribute to a great man.' McNeill himself said: 'When Peter contacted me regarding the statue I was completely taken by surprise. 'Whenever I walk up the Celtic Way, I look on with a great sense of pride at the sight of Brother Walfrid, Big Jock and my old team-mate and friend Jinky rightly taking their place almost as guardians of Celtic Park. 'Every time I look back at this special club's history and what we achieved it fills me with joy, and now to be told I am to be honoured beside these Celtic greats, this really is a special day for me and all my family.'

"Imran Uddin used a keyboard spying device to hack into university computers and up his exam marks . A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard ‘shadowing’ devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as £49 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: ‘For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.’ He warned that Uddin’s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system. The judge added that he felt compelled to put Uddin behind bars as a ‘deterrence’ to others. Judge Burbridge said: ‘This kind of conduct undermines, or has the potential to undermine, public confidence in the degree system, set up by this university. I have decided I cannot pass a suspended sentence because there needs to be an element of deterrence.’ Uddin was found out after staff discovered the devices when several computers were upgraded on October 7 last year. When they removed the protective casing from the computers in the bio-science building, the spying devices were discovered. Staff then began checking other university computer equipment and a further three spying devices were found. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said: ‘It is effectively a case where the defendant has hacked into a number of computers at the university where he was studying for a degree in bio-science.’ Miss Rai said one tracker had been attached to a computer in a ‘staff only’ area to obtain the password of employee Christine Chapman, who had access to exam grade software.

"A driver has been arrested after a £200,000 supercar was allegedly spotted driving at 150mph on the M25. The black and white Ferrari California was pulled over by two police cars last night on the busy motorway near Woking, Surrey. The car has been seized by police while a man, aged 25, was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and has since been bailed. Surrey Police tweeted this message last night after this Ferrari California was alleged seen doing 150mph . The car was allegedly seen doing the high speeds between junctions 8 and 10 of the M25 in Surrey . Officers say the high-performance vehicle, the first model of which was released in 2008, was seen doing 150mph between junctions eight, near Reigate, and junction 10, near Woking. The police force tweeted a photo of the car alongside the message: '#M25 J8-10 Ferrari California 150mph with two police cars behind. Vehicle seized and driver arrested.' The force later revealed it had 'numerous calls' about the car and responded within three minutes.

The Italian-made vehicle appears to have a personalised number plate and red interior. Other motorists on Twitter expressed shock that the vehicle managed to reach such speeds on a road famous for its heavy traffic. Dawn Denyer tweeted: 'I'm normally lucky to get to 60mph on that stretch. Is that what the new variable speed signs are for?'

"It's not time to play the music. For Lewis Hamilton has said the building of his ‘brand’ after Formula One — possibly in a recording studio — must not cloud his determination to win a third world championship. Hamilton has been a regular at showbusiness events in the close season, but now his red private jet has touched down in Melbourne and his focus has switched to the defence of his title in the opening race of the campaign. Nonetheless, his life is something of a juggling act. Yes, winning races is by far the most important thing, yet he has engaged transatlantic PR and talent agencies to polish his image after a split from Simon Fuller, who shaped ‘Brand Beckham’. Lewis Hamilton wants to replicate the scenes that followed after his second world championship title . Hamilton (left) has been pictured alongside Kanye West and Kim Kardashian since his triumph . Hamilton is adamant his growing profile will not distract him from matters on the racing track . Hamilton has never hidden his passion for music, posting Instagram snaps playing guitar . Is that ‘brand’ something Hamilton wants to replicate? ‘At the moment, it’s winning championships that counts,’ he said. ‘I don’t wish to stop racing but I’m conscious I’m halfway through my career, or maybe gone past halfway, and that the next six, seven or however many years I get will come and go. Whatever steps I take now will determine what I do after. ‘I don’t want to be a commentator, although I think I’d be OK at it because I obviously know a lot about the sport, but there are other things I would like to try. So it’s exploring those and building a foundation.’ Does that mean music? ‘I’m continuing to plod along and enjoy my music when I get time,’ said Hamilton. ‘But I haven’t been in the studio since January, and just for a couple of days. That’s the least music I’ve done during a winter for some time. ‘Music is more of my life than people are aware of. When you’re doing music you have a choice of how much you want to show and how vulnerable you want to be. I approach it just as a hobby, something I enjoy. It’s therapeutic. ‘I like to have feedback from people who are experienced. I’ve never been tempted to release anything but I’ve not had the worst of comments about my songs, either.’ Hamilton has spoken about several post-career avenues, including an acting role in Hollywood. He rules out very little. Hamilton admits that he wants to explore his creative side when he is away from Formula One .

Lewis Hamilton has said the building of his 'brand' after Formula One — possibly in a recording studio — must not cloud his determination to win a third world championship. Hamilton has been a regular at showbusiness events in the close season, but now his red private jet has touched down in Melbourne and his focus has switched to the defence of his title in the opening race of the campaign. Nonetheless, his life is something of a juggling act. Yes, winning races is by far the most important thing, yet he has engaged transatlantic PR and talent agencies to polish his image after a split from Simon Fuller, who shaped 'Brand Beck","

"Nick Scholfield is lined up to ride Spring Heeled in the Grand National at Aintree on April 11 . Nick Scholfield has been lined up to ride Jim Culloty’s Spring Heeled in the Crabbie’s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week. Scholfield had been expected to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Sam Winner, who was pulled up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in the £1million race. But the champion trainer said on Wednesday it was unfair to tie Scholfield down to a gelding which is far from certain to run when the mount on another leading definite contender is being offered. Scholfield, who has ridden in six Nationals and finished third in 2013 on Teaforthree, will travel to Ireland to sit on Spring Heeled at Culloty’s County Cork stable on Friday. Nicholls said: ‘I have not made up my mind if I am going to run Sam Winner yet and Nick needed a decision. ‘I did not want to get into a situation next week when I had to say ""sorry mate, he is not running"" and did not want to stop him getting a good ride. ‘I have not pressed any buttons on any of the horses who ran at Cheltenham. That will happen over the weekend and early next week. I don’t want to run unless I am really happy. ‘I have plenty of other lads who could ride Sam Winner if he runs and would not be afraid to use Will Biddick or Harry Skelton.’ Spring Heeled (right) wins the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at Cheltenham last year . Spring Heeled, winner of Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at last season’s Cheltenham Festival, has been given a National preparation. The eight-year-old has run only once since finishing fourth to Road To Riches in the Galway Plate in July when he was fourth of five in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February. Racemail revealed on Wednesday that Culloty would have two runners in the National. Robbie McNamara will ride his 2014 Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere. Scholfield rides Teaforthree (front) as the horse jumps the last fence at Aintree in the 2013 Grand National . McNamara said: ‘It's a great ride to get and I'm looking forward to it. I've ridden him before in a Grade One in Leopardstown and I was supposed to ride him in the Hennessy there as well, but I broke my collarbone the day before. I'm delighted to get back on him.’ With Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Double Ross another confirmed non runner, David Pipe’s well supported Soll appears guaranteed a run at the bottom of the weights. Luke Morris became the first jockey to ride 100 winners during an All Weather Flat racing season when a double at Chelmsford on Wednesday aboard Giantouch and Middle East Pearl carried him to 101 successes for the campaign.

"Kevin Pietersen battered Oxford’s students for 170 off 149 deliveries in his first game of red-ball cricket for 15 months – then insisted the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves has told him everyone has a ‘clean slate’. Pietersen’s quest for an improbable return to international cricket began as his scriptwriter must have known it would: with sumptuous strokes, a standing ovation and much of the old bravado. The fact that his first hundred since the Old Trafford Test against Australia in August 2013 came against a modest attack, at a windswept Oxford, in a game not deemed first-class, is beside the point. Pietersen’s only hope of playing for England again is to score lots of runs for Surrey – wind, rain or shine. Here was the first box ticked, in style. Surrey's Kevin Pietersen (right) celebrates reaching his 100 during the three-day Match at The Parks . Pietersen makes his way out to the crease following the dismissal of Rory Burns . It was the 34-year-old's first appearance for Surrey since the LV= County Championship in June 2013 . Asked what Graves had said to him when the pair spoke over the phone last month, Pietersen replied: ‘He said he wants the best players playing for England, and everyone has a clean slate. Right now, it’s just about me hitting the red ball. I think it can help England going forward. ‘I took confidence from the way I played in Australia [at the Big Bash]. It was as well as I’ve ever batted. I’ve been given a lifeline, and I have an opportunity to get back to doing something I love that was taken away from me prematurely.’ England meet West Indies in Antigua on Monday, and comparisons will be inevitable. There will be mixed feelings both in the Caribbean and at Lord’s. Whether Pietersen’s journey will prove more futile than fruitful is another matter. The first aim of the new regime at the ECB has been to stop the sniping; the second may be to keep Pietersen sweet in case English cricket needs him after he retires, possibly in a mentoring capacity. Regardless, the evidence here – as if it were required – suggested he is deadly serious about reclaiming his place. Pietersen has played exclusively Twenty20 cricket throughout the world since being axed by England . A young spectator points to a dent in her mother's car made by one of Pietersen's shots . Pietersen made 62 on his only prior appearance at The Parks, for Nottinghamshire in April 2004 . With Surrey 122 for five at lunch, Pietersen (left) found himself on 47 not out from 58 balls . Nearly 10 years on from his Ashes-clinching century at The Oval, Pietersen cannot have imagined he would need to prosper in the Parks simply to stay afloat. But in front of a crowd of several hundred – almost unheard of in these parts – and with Surrey stumbling to 113 for five, he had a captive audience and a job to do. Pietersen was careful at first, waiting until his

"The trend for fresh, local, unprocessed foods could be putting people at risk if they opt to drink raw milk. This is according to a new study that claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill than the pasteurised version. Raw milk is associated with more than half of all milk-related food borne illnesses, even though only an estimated 3.5 per cent of the population in the US drink it. Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. Advocates believe it is s healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. But a new study claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill . Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. All fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised – heated to 72C (162F) for 25 seconds. As well as killing E.coli, the process also eliminates campylobacter, salmonella and listeria. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs. Advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. They also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma, hay fever and food allergies in children. But US tests have shown that the nutrients in raw and pasteurised milk are the same. Advocates believe that raw milk, which contains more natural antibodies, proteins, and bacteria than pasteurised milk, is healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. They argue pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. But the new study shows the risks are better understood than the benefits and that more research is needed to prove that the health claims are legitimate. They claim it can put people at risk of microbial contaminants commonly found in milk including infectious Salmonella, Campylobacter,and Listeria species along with the most dangerous form of E. coli. These bacteria can cause foodborne illness in humans, including diarrhea, vomiting, cramping, fevers, and sometimes more serious consequences such as kidney failure or death. 'The risks of consuming raw milk instead of pasteurised milk are well-established in the scientific literature and in some cases can have severe or even fatal consequences,' says Cissy Li, a graduate student in environmental health sciences at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 'Based on our findings, we discourage the consumption of raw milk, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, people with impaired immune systems, pregnant women, and children.' Pasteurisation involves heating milk to destroy microbes in the milk supply from fecal contamination, dairy operations, cow udders, or other sources. Treated milk is hermetically sealed to prevent recontamination. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may also contain these bugs .

"Real Madrid will need to play with intensity for 90 minutes and not just the first half if they are to have a chance of beating Barcelona in Sunday's La Liga 'Clasico', according to Real coach Carlo Ancelotti. Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.' Real have the rest of the week to prepare for Sunday's showdown at Barca, who take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday.

"(CNN)I can't remember exactly when my teenage fascination with computers collided with the federal government, but I will never forget the morning in 1983 when two FBI agents showed up on my parents' doorstep. I had gone to bed around 4 or 5 a.m. after spending hours on my computer, which was pretty common for me back then, at age 18. A few hours later, my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business. I had a slight fear this day would come, because only a couple of days earlier, I had a strange call from a friend asking me what I would do if we were visited by the police or some type of investigation team. Two men sitting at my kitchen table pulled out badges and stated they were with the FBI. They said they needed to talk to me. Let me start with a little history: I got my first taste of computers in the mid-1970s in junior high school. We had a teletype terminal that had been brought to our school with an acoustic modem attached. We were shown how it worked and some of us had a chance to do some math testing. I did not get to use it the first time, but I stayed after school that evening to see if I could get a chance to try it out. The teacher dialed into the central office computer, logged in and started the math program. I felt like a new world opened for me. For the first time in my life, I saw something that made me imagine what I wanted to do when I grew up. That junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school. There, I learned of an Explorer Scout group sponsored by IBM. For the next couple of years I built a friendship with a group of people who had interests similar to mine -- some closer than others. We would play with computers at school, in Explorer Scouts, in stores like Radio Shack and at home. Finally in 1982, I bought my first computer. Some of my friends already had computers and now my time came and I finally got my own. I purchased a Heathkit H-89, which we built in a friend's basement. At the same time I also bought a Hayes 309 baud Smartmodem. I used my computer and modem to log onto electronic bulletin board systems, or BBS, and create more friendships and acquaintances. We were a curious group and we were eager to learn more and more about the different computers made and how they worked. We ended up getting into about a dozen computer systems -- from the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to a major international bank system in Los Angeles to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, one of only two U.S. laboratories dedicated to nuclear weapons research. We were really just looking

"Christian Benteke believes it would be risky to suggest Aston Villa can be safe from relegation with one more victory. The Belgian striker, back to form under manager Tim Sherwood with eight goals in six games, said his side must continue to stretch their lead over the drop zone. Villa are six points clear of Queens Park Rangers in 18th but the gap could close this weekend with Burnley and Leicester in Premier League action and Sherwood’s team in the FA Cup semi-final. Christian Benteke rises above Fererico Fazio to head the winning goal for Aston Villa against Tottenham . Benteke points to the skies in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches . Benteke said: ‘The more the better, I think it's risky to say we can take three points and we're finished. We have to try to win every game. ‘Saturday was a massive three points because now we're six points clear of QPR so it's very important for us to be far off them.’ Benteke, 24, said the match against Brendan Rodgers’ team at Wembley was the biggest of his career. ‘For the moment, yes,’ he said. ‘It (missing the World Cup) was hard but now it's in the past, I'm looking forward to playing the semi final. Benteke thinks it would be risky to think that one more win will be enough to ensure survival . ‘Liverpool are a good team but the thing with the FA Cup is it's still something special. It's 50-50 for me but some will say they are favourites. ‘Wembley is something good and special because it's a semi final, it's close to the final and we have to do everything to be there again.’ Benteke believes his partnership with Gabby Agbonalhor can destroy defences. He added: ‘He (Sherwood) said to the team we have to play to our strengths, to play with me and Gabby. ‘He helped me to destroy the defenders, with two we're always better than one. I'm comfortable, it's a good partnership.’

"Holders Bayern Munich struck either side of the break to beat second division Eintracht Braunschweig 2-0 on Wednesday and advance to the German Cup quarter-finals. A dazzling free-kick by David Alaba on the stroke of halftime and Mario Gotze's solo effort in the 57th minute were enough for Bayern, who were in control but never needed to hit top form against their toothless visitors. The Bavarians, top of the Bundesliga and chasing another domestic double, were up against a gutsy Braunschweig defence, with winger Franck Ribery frustrated in the first half by Braunschweig's physical play. David Alaba celebrates scoring during Bayern Munich's win against Eintracht Braunschweig . Midfielder Mario Gotze scored the German Cup holders' second goal of the evening . Brazilian defender Dante wins a header during the German Cup match on Wednesday evening . Arjen Robben, however, was lucky to be awarded a foul in the 45th minute with minimal contact by the Braunschweig player but it mattered little for Austria international Alaba, who unleashed a ferocious free kick into the top corner. Gotze killed off opposition hopes of a comeback early in the second half before Bayern stepped off the gas, content to protect their lead. Runaway third division leaders Arminia Bielefeld shocked in-form Bundesliga club Werder Bremen 3-1 with two goals from former German youth international Manuel Junglas to seal the biggest upset so far in the German Cup round of 16.

Werder captain Clemens Fritz, who was sent off near the end following a second booking, pulled one back but Junglas made sure it was a memorable evening for the former Bundesliga club when he finished off a quick break.

"Drilling has begun beneath a German city by a team of Indiana Jones pensioners who believe they are on the trail of the fabled Amber Room of the Tsars. The OAP treasure hunters are digging beneath the streets of the old industrial city of Wuppertal. The Amber Room - valued at around £250million in today's money - was looted from the palace of Peter the Great in Soviet Russia by invading Nazi troops in 1941. It is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from World War Two never to be found and has captivated treasure hunters ever since it was first plundered. Some say the panels were destroyed by Soviet artillery fire on the Prussian city of Koenigsberg, others that they were dumped in an Alpine lake by the SS in the closing days of the war.

Digging for treasure: A team of Indiana Jones pensioners being drilling under the German city of Wuppertal, where they are convinced the Amber Room is hidden after it was looted by the Nazis from Russia in 1941 . Lost art: The Amber Room seen in all its glory in 1930 before it was stolen from the Catherine Palace . The city is riddled with subterranean bunkers and tunnels dug by the Nazis. It is here, said Kleine, that he has received information that the crates arrived from Koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden. He said: 'Erich Koch, the Nazi gauleiter of East Prussia who died in a Polish prison in 1986, came from Wuppertal. 'As the Red Army closed in on Koenigsberg, he ordered the treasure to be packed up and brought back to his hometown. We have studied records and spoken to people from the time. 'He did not want to leave the world's greatest treasure in a region with an unknown political future; rather he brought it to a place he knew where he had a good chance of accessing it in the future.

"Killing a spider is one thing but seeing hundreds of babies explode from its body afterwards would freak out anyone. This was the case in Hallett Cove, South Australia, when a man smacked a huge wolf spider as it scuttled across his kitchen floor. He got the shock of his life when he squashed the hairy beast with a broom, only to see hundreds of baby spiders came crawling out of the mother and spreading out in all directions on the floor. A female wolf spider scuttles across a kitchen floor in Hallett Cove, South Australia . The house owner is not too happy and promptly gets out a broom to get rid of the hairy beast . ‘Ohhh look at the babies come out of it,’ the man says in surprise. The scene was greeted by the voice of a woman in the background saying: ‘Ahhhhh, kill it!!’ A few more whacks later, and the tiny babies were running everywhere on the floor. But to his surprise after smashing the female spider a few times with the broom hundreds of babies appear . After giving the spider some more whacks for good measure, the man was heard saying: ‘It’s dead.’ Finally the broom was used for what it was made for - sweeping up what was left on the floor. The Australian Repile Park website explains that after mating, the female wolf spider produces a silk mat into which she deposits around 100 eggs. Soon the tiny baby spiders are trying to make a run for it all over the kitchen floor . The silk is then rolled into a protective ball which she attaches to her abdomen and proceeds to carry it around with her until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the babies crawl onto the mother's back and remain there until their fat reserves have been used up and they need to start finding their own food, which may take several months. That is unless the female spider is cracked a few times over the head with a broom. With the spider now dead the man sweeps it up as well as the babies that are spread all around .

"Forget switchblades it's shears that will be the new weapon of choice for members of New Zealand's notorious Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs who are set to take up a new community initiative. The New Zealand Herald reports that in July the council of Dunedin City, on the South Island's east coast, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work - such as mowing lawns, trimming hedges, and cutting back foliage. Both the Mongrel Mob and Black Power have shared a violent rivalry spanning decades. The gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder, and robbery - but last year the gangs surprised everyone by suddenly making peace, not war. The council of Dunedin City, on New Zealand's South Island, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work . It's a very different kind of work than they're used to, but the gangs have joined forces in a submission to the Dunedin City Council, asking for help in acquiring paid work to support their families. 'It's remarkable they're working together. They've had a long history of just shooting each other,' Dunedin Mayor Dave Cull said. 'But I think they're both beginning to realise that violence won't provide them much of a future anymore.' Rather than shoot and knife each other the proposal was put forward for them to work together as an employment solution for gang members who were struggling to support their families, and steer them from a life of crime. The Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder and robbery . Mayor Cull explained that as the men approach middle age they've found their reputation and appearance have prevented them from finding traditional and regular employment. In response to concerns that work is being spoon-fed to gang members and that there are others more deserving of the chance, the Dunedin City Council said it will ensure that both Mongrel Mob and Black Power have to meet standard expectations. This includes meeting state health and safety requirements and providing insurance cover like any other commercial landscaping company.

He did not see the toddler and ran her over as he pulled his truck up in the driveway (above) to move the trash cans and ran over and killed the 20-month-old . 'He got into the red Chevy pickup truck parked at the residence to pull it forward so he could move the garbage cans and unfortunately the child managed to get under, in front of car and he ran over the child,' Unified Police Department Lt. Justin Hoyal told Fox 13. 'Very tragic situation here today.' Kendra suffered severe head trauma and was unconscious when medical workers arrived, and was pronounced dead shortly after at a nearby hospital. This is now the fourth time since August that a child was accidentally run over and killed in their own driveway by a family member in Utah. The grandfather is not facing any charges at this time, but the case remains under investigation. 'No family member ever wants to go through something like this, and so it’s always important that when you are pulling out, you’re backing out of your driveway: Just take that extra second to check and make sure there is nobody, none of the children have followed you out, or nobody is around your vehicle,' said Hoyal.

"For the first time in a decade, astronomers have found dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way - an unprecedented nine in total. They range in distance from 95,000 to 1.2 million light-years, and each contain far fewer stars than our galaxy. Crucially, though, the dwarf galaxies could help test theories of dark matter and perhaps bring us a step closer to detecting the elusive particles. Move the slider below to see an image of the southern sky before and after the new dwarf galaxies are added . Astronomers have found nine new dwarf galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way. They are the first to be discovered orbiting our galaxy in more than a decade. This image shows the previously known Magellanic Clouds with six of the nine newly discovered dwarf galaxies above the Paranal Observatory in Chile . The discovery was made by a team of astronomers at the University of Cambridge using data from the Dark Energy Survey, a five-year project to photograph the southern sky in extreme detail. The nine dwarf galaxies were spotted in the night sky in the southern hemisphere, near the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud, which are the largest dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way's orbit. Astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy, making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light-years wide. This is based on re-analysis of a distant ring that surrounds our galaxy, which the astronomers think is now actually part of it, and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies. The team of scientists from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York studied the Monoceros Ring, which is a long ring-like filament of stars that ‘wraps’ around our galaxy three times. ‘The discovery of so many satellites in such a small area of the sky was completely unexpected,' said Dr Sergey Koposov of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, the study’s lead author. ‘I could not believe my eyes.’ The newly discovered objects are each a billion times dimmer than the Milky Way, and a million times less massive. This makes them incredibly difficult to find, even in our galactic neighbourhood. Dwarf galaxies are the smallest galaxy structures in the universe, and can contain as few as 5,000 stars - whereas the Milky Way has around 200 billion. Importantly, though, they are thought to contain 99 per cent dark matter and just one per cent observable matter. This means they should be useful to test cosmological theories of dark matter, which makes up 25 per cent of all matter in the universe but is yet to be detected. ‘Dwarf satellites are the final frontier for testing our theories of dark matter,’ said Dr Vasily Belokurov of the Institute of Astronomy, one of the study’s co-authors. ‘We need to find them to determine whether our cosmological picture makes sense. Finding such a large group of satellites near the Magellanic Clouds was surprising, though, as earlier surveys of the southern sky found very little, so we were not expecting to stumble on such treasure.’ The

"A New York mother claims her daughter was left partially paralyzed by a marijuana-infused brownie she bought at her high school. Danieel Buchanan, 17, was sold the snack by a classmate at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn on February 27, thinking its ingredients were innocent. But the teenager started to feel sick soon after and went to the school nurse with a racing heart rate and high blood pressure. Scroll down for video . Concern: Danieel Buchanan, 17, was sold a pot brownie at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn. She fell sick soon after and her mother claims she has been partially paralyzed ever since . The school then called her mother Allison at 11am to say they were taking her daughter to the emergency room at Brooklyn Hospital. After an initial check-up she was released into her parents' care - but her condition started to dramatically deteriorate. Her mother told PIX 11 she couldn't walk by herself, could barely eat and could only handle a few sips of tea at a time. At 3am the next morning, she took the youngster to Beth Israel in Manhattan, but was quickly transferred to nearby Mount Sinai. Her mother says when Danieel arrived she began convulsing and has been partially-paralyzed ever since. 'She’s not able to walk. She can’t stand. She can’t sit up,' Mrs Buchanan told the station. 'They have never seen anything like this before.' Blood tests revealed she had marijuana in her system - but no other drugs were present. Impact: The teenager is being treated in Mount Sinai hospital in New York. Her mother claims she cannot sit up by herself, walk or eat properly . Action: The 18-year-old student who sold her the brownie at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn has been suspended and the NYPD are investigating the incident . Mrs Buchanan insists she has never been involved in drugs or alcohol before and doesn't have any underlying health problems. 'She didn't know it had weed in there, she thought it was just a regular brownie,' Mrs Buchanan said. Doctors told her she needed rehabilitative therapy, but her insurance company , Empire Blue Cross, Blue shield, has denied her the coverage. The Daily Mail Online has contacted them for comment.

"(CNN)When ISIS overran their villages near Mosul in August 2014, a small group of Assyrians, a Middle Eastern minority with a history reaching back more than 4,000 years, picked up weapons and formed their own militia: Dwekh Nawsha -- ""The Sacrificers."" Assyrians belong to the rapidly dwindling Christian population of Iraq -- recent estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq put the number as low as 300,000 compared with 1.5 million 20 years ago -- and many among them see the fight with ISIS as a final battle for survival against the Islamists. ""'Ah, Assyrians -- I've read about them in the Bible,' is what many people say,"" says Marcus Naissan, a 25-year-old electrical technician and member of Dwekh Nawsha. ""But we are not just history, we are still alive, we are still here."" The exodus of Christians from Iraq started prior to ISIS -- and the civil war in the mid-2000s took an especially heavy toll. Today, most Iraqi Christians live in Kurdish areas in the north, which have been a relative haven of stability. And so far, the Kurds have been taking heavy losses to defend Christian and Yezidi minorities against ISIS. Every night, the fighters hear the rumbling sound of coalition airplanes in the sky over Baqufa where they have their safe house just a few miles from the frontline. Here they relax, patrol the empty streets of the village and try to hinder ISIS suicide commandos from entering the near city of Dohuk where UNHCR says almost 100,000 refugees -- many of them Christians -- have found a temporary place to stay. So far, the militia has only assembled and trained 40 fighters. But Rama Baito, manager of the digital media presence of the group, shows me his direct messages on Facebook -- dozens of ex-soldiers, diaspora Assyrians or Christian activists from all over the world contact him and offer monetary support or their own presence on the frontline. ""We have 200 people waiting right now, because we simply do not have enough weapons and training capacities,"" Baito says. Since they are still small and have no heavy weaponry, the Dwekh Nawsha fighters say they coordinate closely with local Kurdish Peshmerga commanders and share the same foxholes on the frontline. The fighters are a very mixed bunch. A young baker, carrying his large military dagger in an elegant sheath, says he brought his father when he enlisted. ""But now, we see each other only rarely because he is in another unit of our group,"" he says. ""When I go on vacation, he goes to the field and the other way around. So every time we swap units, I wait for him, give him a quick hug and then leave back home."" Right now, ISIS is focused on other fronts -- the yellow fields of the Niniveh plains are quite safe for the mostly young fighters. But none of them thinks victory over ISIS will be quick, nor that fighting will end immediately afterward. All they can do now is patrol the deserted alleys of

In Arteta's absence, the Gunners have moved up into the top two of the Barclays Premier League with a run of eight successive victories. The former Rangers and Everton man is determined to first get himself fully match fit and then sort out the formalities of a new deal. 'My only aim is to get back fit and try to perform on the pitch. As long as I do that I am sure that I will continue with this club, with the relationship I have with the club and the respect I have from everybody here,' said Arteta, who signed on transfer deadline day in August 2011. 'If I don't do that then I am not going to be here because I don't want to be somewhere where I cannot perform at my best and give what I think I can give. 'In May, when everything is fine, we will sit down and talk and it will take five minutes.' Arteta is set to step up his rehabilitation next week, and could be back in contention for the showdown against Chelsea on April 26. 'I am not far. I have done five or six sessions with the first team and I am feeling good,' he said. Arteta has missed much of the season but his team-mates have racked up a run of eight successive victories . A calf injury which sidelined him since the end of November has been followed up with a minor ankle issue . 'I don't feel I am ready to start, but I'm almost there.

"An airport worker has been awarded $40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago. Brandon Afoa, 33, of Puyallup, Washington, was operating a tug to push aircraft at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when the brakes and steering failed, causing him to crash into a luggage lift. The incident, which took place at 2am on December 26, 2007, left Afoa unable to use his legs or right arm. Much of his intestinal tract also had to be removed by surgeons. Afoa went on to sue Port of Seattle - which owns and operates the Sea-Tac airport - in King County Superior Court, saying that the company failed to maintain a safe workplace. Closure: An airport worker has been awarded $40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago . But for years the case was locked in the courts because the Port of Seattle claimed it wasn't liable for what happened as Afoa worked for a private firm. In a bid to move things forward, the state supreme court finally ruled in 2013 that the airport had a 'duty' to provide a safe working environment. On Tuesday a King County jury awarded Afoa $40 million because of what the incident has done to his life. Indeed, the paraplegic needs round-the-clock help from caregivers just to survive. In the courtroom a panel was shown video footage of Afoa being craned from his bed by a special lift to a commode and undergoing therapy. Jurors went on to apportion 25per cent of the blame for the accident to the Port of Seattle. Meanwhile, a number of airlines which weren’t part of the lawsuit will pay the rest of the money owed. This is because they had contracts with Afoa's previous employer - Evergreen Aviation Ground Logistics Enterprises - which has since gone out of business. Commenting on the outcome, Afoa told KOMO-TV: 'It was a relief and I'm very thankful for the jury for making an awesome decision.' In a statement, the Port of Seattle expressed its sympathies to Afoa and his family for the accident. The agency says it's reviewing the decision. If it decides to appeal the verdict, it could delay payment of Afoa's award.

The police department displayed a host of photographs which they think vindicates their officers at a new conference today . Los Angeles police chief Charlie Beck showed off the images at a news conference, recorded by local channel ABC7, 24 hours after the confrontation. He claimed the images showed that the magazine and slide of the officer's pistol were damaged - and that a bullet had been partially discharged from the chamber. Beck said: 'While on the ground and struggling with the officers the man forcibly grabbed on of the officers' holstered pistols, resulting in an officer involved shooting. 'Photos of the officer's pistol are on my right. As you can see, the slide is partially engaged and a round had been partially ejected and has fouled the firing chamber. 'This is indicative of a struggle over the weapon. As you can also see, the magazine is dislodged from its resting-place. This is also idnicative of force used on a weapon.

"At last it’s on. Not only the Fight of the Century but the sale of tickets for Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao. The desert storm in a box office which some thought might pull the plug on the richest fight of all time has blown over. Those priceless tickets will be on sale at 8pm on Thursday after weeks of wrangling and accusations between Mayweather Promotions and Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum. Tickets for the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are on sale on Thursday . Pacquiao posted a picture of him looking in good shape 10 days before the fight . This thorny matter was settled at a meeting between Arum, Mayweather’s advisor Al Haymon and CBS television mogul Les Moonves who brokered the deal for the fight itself. The issues over the number of tickets, credentials and hotel rooms to be made available to each camp were all resolved. Since this required a separate contract with the MGM there was speculation that the fight might be in jeopardy. In reality May 2 in the Grand Garden Arena was always going to take place. Mayweather trains with his uncle Roger during a media workout in Las Vegas last week . Pacquiao is taken on the pads by trainer Freddie Roach in front of the watching media . Even Arum, angered as he was by delays he blamed on the Mayweather side for making the tickets release far later than for any big fight ever, had said: ‘There’s too much at stake for the plug to be pulled. Like half-billion dollars which it is now expected to generate, with Mayweather and Pacquiao set to bank at least $180million and $120m respectively, . Arum adds: ‘All the matters have been agreed and the contract is being drawn up.’ The vast majority of the 16,500 tickets were always destined to be parcelled up between the two promoters, the two cable networks sharing the pay-per-view broadcast and the MGM hotel group for their clients and high rollers. Only a token 1000 seats are going on public sale, at between $1,500 (£1,000) and $7,500 (£5,000) each. But none for the super-ringside tickets costing $10,000 (£6,600). There are reports that those seats will exchanged hands on ‘the alternative market’ for upwards of $200,000 (£133,000) As many as 50,000 tickets will be available to watch the fight at various MGM properties via closed-circuit television. Priced at $150 (£100), they will be on sale at 11pm on Thursday.

"An anonymous Good Samaritan has donated $360,000 to pay for a man's mortgage after he lost his wife and house in the mudslide that swept Washington last year. Tim Ward and his wife of 38 years, Brandy, were at home in Oso, Washington, on March 22, 2014, when tons of debris, soil and rock came crashing down from upland. Brandy was one of the 43 people crushed by the force of the natural disaster. Tim, who broke his pelvis, was buried under 25 feet of mud, but managed to call for help through a gap in the surface. Just a week later, as Tim started trying to rebuild his life, he was informed he did not have 'landslide insurance' - and therefore did not qualify for payment to settle his mortgage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Brandy Ward (right) was killed in the mudslide that swept Oso, Washington, in March last year. Her husband Tim (left) survived and has spent the past year trying to pay his mortgage, which a donor has now paid . Horrific: The mudslide on March 22, 2014, killed 43 people including Brandy Ward . For a year, Tim has been grappling with his financial predicament, while renting a small property nearby. He lost everything in the mudflow. Only one of their five dogs survived the mudslide, but lost a leg. The disaster killed their turkeys, chickens and four canines. The mortgage, however, consumed him. But last week, he received a call from Chase Bank, who said an anonymous donor had paid the lot. Before: This was their idyllic home in Oso where they reared turkeys and chickens before the mudslide . Love: The couple were married for 38 years. Tim said he heard Brandy call for him before she was killed . Overwhelmed: Ward said he couldn't believe it when Chase Bank told him the mortgage was all paid for . Speaking to NBC News, Tim said: 'There are still good Samaritans out there. This is life-changing.' He recalled the horrific day last year: 'She called my name and yelled, ""Tim!"" And from the moment that voice left her body, she had left the man she had been with for 38 years to be with the son of God she'll be with forever.' The donor told bank clerks they had read about Ward in a newspaper and felt compelled to reach out. 'I honestly have never seen this kind of an act of personal generosity where it's anonymous,' Phyllis Campbell, vice president at JP Morgan Chase, told NBC News.

"London Midland has vowed to give police CCTV images of a 'disgusting' passenger suspected of defecating inside a train carriage as it travelled through the Birmingham area. The passenger who made the awful discovery said the smell was so bad that it forced the operator to cancel the service from Lichfield Trent Valley to Longbridge. It plunged commuters into hours of misery as the act of vandalism on the Cross City line caused severe delays. A passenger made the awful discovery on a train travelling between Lichfield Trent Valley and Longbridge . Passenger Christopher Talbot told the Birmingham Mail he was heading to work on the 7:50am service on Thursday when he found excrement in a newspaper on the floor. He said: ‘As I sat down I saw a newspaper on the floor. I leaned over and noticed there was something inside it. ‘It looked like poo basically. The smell was going through the carriage. These trains have toilets on.’ The 52-year-old, who works as a cleaner at a school, said there was only one other passenger in the carriage, and he reported the incident to platform staff when he disembarked at Butlers Lane in Four Oaks. London Midland said that CCTV images of the culprit would be passed onto police for investigation . The service terminated at Birmingham New Street so that the carriage that was used as a toilet could be cleaned. Normal service resumed at about 9:30am.

"A 27-year-old man has died in outback NSW while attempting to recreate scenes from the iconic Mad Max film franchise with a group of fellow fans. The man, believed to be a US national, died instantly on Tuesday evening when his motorbike collided with a Mack truck causing him to be thrown from the vehicle. Police from the Barrier Local Area Command said that he was one of a number of Mad Max enthusiasts visiting Silverton, just outside of Broken Hill, where the Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, starring Mel Gibson, was filmed in 1981.

Owner of the Silverton Hotel, Peter Price, said that the Mad Max community was devastated by the news.

"United Nations investigators have found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq. The human rights office published a horrifying report describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists, suggesting they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.' The report, based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors of attacks in Iraq between June 2014 and February 2015, highlights brutal ISIS attacks on the Yazidis. Scroll down for video . Atrocities: Thousands of members of the Yazidi religious minority were forced to flee a 2014 offensive by Islamic State militants in northern Iraq . They have made calls for the perpetrators to be brought to justice at the International Criminal Court. ISIS, which controls a swathe of territory in Iraq and neighbouring Syria, launched a series of systematic and widespread attacks on the Yazidi minority's heartland in the northern Nineveh province last August. The jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed, while younger boys were forced to become child solders and women and girls were abducted as the 'spoils of war', according to the investigators. Head of the investigation, Suki Nagra, said: 'These attacks were aimed at destroying the Yazidi as a group,' suggesting ISIS was guilty of 'genocide' against the minority. The report, which was ordered by the UN Human Rights Council last September following a request from the Iraqi government, pointed out that some villages 'were entirely emptied of their Yazidi population.' Evidence of genoside: A mass grave containing the remains of members of the Yazidi community was discovered by Kurdish forces near the Iraqi village of Sinuni in February . Many Yazidi women and girls were sold into sexual slavery or handed over to IS members as 'gifts', the report said, adding that witnesses had described hearing girls as young as six screaming for help as they were raped in a house used by IS fighters. Boys as young as eight were forced to convert to Islam and given religious and military training, including being forced to watch videos of beheadings, the report said. 'One of the most shocking thing was how organised the attacks have been,' Nagra told reporters. The Yazidis at first thought they would be given the same choice as Christians in places overrun by the jihadists: to convert to Islam, pay a tax or leave. But then the fighters received orders via telephone, and suddenly the men and older boys were being marched off to be executed. 'There was a clear chain of command,' she said. Innocent: A Yazidi child whose family fled a 2014 offensive by Islamic State militants at the Dohuk shelter for displaced civilians in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region . According to witness and victim testimony, foreign fighters from at least 10 countries, including a couple of westerners, had taken part in the attacks, as had some people from neighbouring villages. The Yazidis, whose ancient religion has elements of Christianity, Islam and Zoroastrianism, are considered to be devil

"(CNN)From late January, when New England was living through one of its bleakest and snowiest winters, to a warm and sunny afternoon in April, the jurors in the first-degree murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez have considered how a promising young athlete who earned millions came to take the life of his onetime friend and future brother-in-law, Odin Lloyd. The jury of seven women and five men listened to more than 130 witnesses and reviewed more than 400 pieces of evidence over the months-long trial. On Wednesday, they convicted Hernandez, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, after deliberating more than 35 hours over parts of seven days. After the verdict, jurors agreed to meet with reporters, at times laughing nervously while shedding light on what some described as the grueling deliberation process. Here are five things to know about what they said: . While declining to discuss specifics of what happened in the jury room, jurors said they came away satisfied with their decision. ""It's a very big decision to make, and every one of us ... made sure we came to the best conclusion,"" one juror told reporters. At one point on Monday, jurors asked Judge Susan Garsh to allow smoking breaks, which were permitted during trial. Some observers thought this signaled weeks of deliberations. A male juror said some panel members had meticulously filled four to eight notebooks as they listened to testimony. ""It was hard ... for everyone,"" said a woman on the jury. ""Everyone's life changed because of this."" Asked to elaborate, she told a reporter, ""I've been here for as long as you have."" ""It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,"" she said later about serving on the jury. ""Absolutely, by far."" Asked whether they would say anything to Hernandez, one of the women on the panel said simply, ""Nothing."" Others nodded in apparent agreement. Do they have any feelings about the 25-year-old former star? ""For me, Judge Garsh said, 'Keep your mind suspended,' "" said a female juror. ""We went in there every day with open minds. We listened to the evidence. We heard what they had to say. We got to go into a room and see and touch and feel all the evidence and that's when we came to our conclusion."" Did they know anything about Hernandez or the case before the trial? One juror responded: ""Nothing."" ""Very little,"" said another. About six jurors raised their hands when asked who among them was a New England Patriots fan. The jurors said they found out about Hernandez's other legal woes from Garsh only after they reached a verdict. Hernandez potentially faces three more trials, one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW. Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured.

"A talented Chinese lawyer who was banned from working in California because of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act has been finally granted a license, 89 years after his death. 'It was also a blow to countless others who, like Chang, aspired to become a lawyer only to have their dream deferred on account of their race, alienage, or nationality,' the unanimous court decision reads. 'It is past time to acknowledge that the discriminatory exclusion of Chang from the State Bar of California was a grievous wrong.' Struggle: Hong Yen Chang, from Guangdong Province, China, travelled to the U.S. in 1872 when he was 12 years old. He studied law at Colombia, graduating in 1886 with 'high markings from the examiners'. But he was banned from practising in California as he was 'a person of Mongolian nativity' Defiant: In later life, Hong served as a banker and a diplomat, and was awarded a doctorate of law by the Chinese government. But he was never granted a license to practise law in California . Hong Yen Chang, from Xiangshan, Guangdong Province, was chosen to travel to the U.S. in 1872 when he was 12 years old, as part of a Chinese Educational Mission. He studied law at Yale and Colombia, from where he graduated in 1886 with 'high markings from the examiners'. However, for the rest of his life he faced a struggle to practise law, as under 19th Century legislation 'a person of Mongolian nativity' would not be accepted to the bar. In 1888, after long deliberations, New York State passed An Act for the Relief of Hong Yen Chang, which waived the Chinese Exclusion Act in the state, allowing him to receive a license to practise law in New York. But the Californian authorities said that they did not recognise the New York ruling, leaving Hong unable to work there. On Monday, the California Supreme Court granted a . posthumous law license to Hong, known as America's first Chinese-born lawyer. This came in response to petitions made by Hong's descendants, as well as the Asian Pacific American Law Students . Association (APALSA) at the University of California. 'Even if we cannot undo history, we can acknowledge it and, . in so doing, accord a full measure of recognition to Chang's . pathbreaking efforts to become the first lawyer of Chinese . descent in the United States,' the court said in its unanimous . ruling. 'More than a century later, the legal and policy . underpinnings of our 1890 decision have been discredited.' The California high court blamed hostility toward Chinese, . cultural tensions and xenophobia for Hong's plight, as well as a range of state . laws designed 'to disadvantage Chinese immigrants' who moved to .

"Amazing pictures have emerged of blue fluorescent algae lighting up Australia's east coast. The images were taken in Jervis Bay, the south coast of NSW, as the neon glow illuminated one of Australia's popular beaches. Photographer Andy Hutchinson described the sight as a 'beautiful supernatural scene' caused by millions of plankton omitting light. A similar display was shown in Sydney's Manly Beach back in August 2014 where an oceanography expert told Daily Mail Australia there was no need to be concerned about the algae. 'The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes,' Iain Suthers, of University of New South Wales, said. Mr Suthers explained that the bizarre carnivorous cell, which preys on another type of algae called diatoms, gives off the luminous glow as a defence mechanism. Scroll down for video .

"Having fathered 40 children by 20 different women, Mike Holpin has enjoyed his fair share of intimacy. But seemingly unsatisfied with his gaggle of offspring, scorned former lovers and being engaged for the fourth time, the 56-year-old is showing no signs of settling down soon. For despite being set to marry, the alcoholic benefits claimant still has a live profile on the site where he met his bride-to-be. Despite being engaged for the fourth time and having already fathered 40 children by 20 different women, Mike Holpin still has an active online dating profile . Offering a half-grin to the camera with his signature pony-tail tucked away from view, Holpin tells prospective conquests: 'I love my kids,' in a brief biography on his Plenty of Fish account. Listed among his hobbies is watching TV and playing computer games - a luxury indulged by the taxpayer who footed the bill for his three 48in widescreen television sets, as revealed earlier this week. But while Holpin paints himself as a doting father, one of his many children has spoken out to confirm the feeling is not mutual. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, two of his sons have revealed they wish they'd never even come into contact with him. Fearful that any girl he meets during a night out may be his sister, care worker Mike Holpin Junior, 22, said dramatically: 'I wish I'd never met my dad. I'd rather be related to Hitler than to him.' Younger brother Luke, 21, said so bad was his father's womanising, his mother once tried to stab him with a butter knife after being duped out of money to buy new motorbikes. 'As soon as the money dried up he moved on. It devastated her. 'She caught him snogging another woman in the garden and tried to stab him with a butter knife.' 'I won't stop': Father of 40 Mike Holpin, left and right with his fiancée Diane, is said to have cost taxpayers £4.3million in benefits and other costs because of his huge family . Family: Holpin says that he loves sex and won't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care . The brothers also claimed their father spent the majority of his benefits payouts on alcohol and new bikes. Earlier this week it was revealed Holpin had cost the taxpayer an estimated £4million in benefits and care costs by fathering so many children. At least 16 have been taken off him and their mothers and placed into care. CARE COSTS: Mike Holpin says 16 of his children were taken into care. A placement in local authority care costs an average of £150,000 a year. If they each spent just a year in care, the bill would be £2.4million. CHILD BENEFIT: £1,000 per annum for the eldest child, plus £700 per year for each additional child, which would be claimed by the person looking after the child. Assuming half his children are now adults and half are still entitled to child benefit, the bill would be at least £500,000.

"Australian Open champion and top seed Novak Djokovic launched his BNP Paribas Open title defence in ruthless style on Saturday, crushing Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis 6-1 6-3 in the second round. Playing near-flawless tennis from the baseline, the Serb broke his opponent twice in each set to coast to victory in just under an hour on the showpiece stadium court at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Fourth seed Andy Murray erased memories of early losses at the venue with a 6-1 6-3 demolition of Canadian Vasek Pospisil and Japanese trailblazer Kei Nishikori recovered from an erratic start to beat American Ryan Harrison 6-4 6-4. World No 1 Novak Djokovic made light work of his first round match at the BNP Paribas Open . Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis was no match for the Australian Open champion at Indian Wells . Djokovic, seeking a fourth title at Indian Wells, breezed through the opening set in just 25 minutes before sealing the win when Baghdatis hit a backhand long on the second match point. 'It went very well for me, a very solid performance from the beginning,' the world No 1 said courtside after improving his record this season to 15-2. 'I served well and from the baseline I didn't give Marcos many chances to come back in the match. Great performance against a quality opponent, against somebody that was a former top-10 player and that knows how to play on a big stage. 'Of course, having won the title in Australia, it allows me to have and carry this confidence into every other event that is coming up in the season.' Djokovic takes time out from the tournament to have a kickabout in the sunshine . Andy Murray celebrates his first round victory over Vasek Pospisil by hitting a ball into the crowd . Murray broke Pospisil's serve three times in the opening set and twice in the second to ease to victory in 79 minutes on a sweltering afternoon. Ousted in the opening round in 2011 and 2012, the 27-year-old Scot hit 14 winners and won five of his nine break point chances to dominate the match. 'I've struggled a bit in the last few years here so I decided to try and play a very solid match and adjust to the conditions,' world number four Murray said. 'It was very hot and that made the ball pretty lively. 'Controlling the ball isn't that easy. I thought I played quite a smart match.' Kei Nishikori was made to sweat before finishing off local boy Ryan Harrison in straight sets . Nishikori, who became the first Asian male to reach a grand slam singles final at the U.S. Open last year, broke Harrison five times while losing his own serve on three occasions before sealing his win in just under an hour and a half. 'It was a bit up and down but I played well in the second set,' said the 25-year-old Japanese. 'I was playing almost a perfect game.' The fifth seed, who lost to Marin Cilic in last year's U.S. Open final before

"Kevin Pietersen is willing to give up his Indian Premier League contract to play county cricket in an attempt to make an extraordinary return to the England side. In what would be the first step of a very long journey back to international cricket, the exiled star is ready to accept the challenge of new ECB chairman Colin Graves and try to fight his way back to the England side. Graves had said in a BBC interview last month that Pietersen would have to be playing regular county cricket if he was to have any chance of being considered by the a regime which is making sweeping changes at the ECB. Kevin Pietersen is willing to turn his back on the Indian Premier League in order to represent England . Pietersen, pictured in 2008, would have to repair his relationship with England boss Peter Moores . The governing body were then quick to emphasise that nothing had changed in their stance and they would only pick those who were not only performing well in county cricket but who were ‘a positive influence on the England side.’ Pietersen was picked up relatively cheaply by the Hyderabad Sunrisers of the IPL this year in a deal worth around £200,000 making it less expensive for him to throw in his lot with an as yet unnamed county and try to call Graves bluff. Yet a comeback, approaching 35, would still be remarkable. England’s need is greatest in one-day cricket, the format of the game Pietersen least enjoyed during his later years with England, and the wounds from his bitter sacking from England are still raw. He reopened many with his bitter book. If he came back it would be hard to see how he could work with senior players like Alastair Cook, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson as well as coach Peter Moores, who he tried to force out in 2009, managing director Paul Downton, who sacked him last year, and national selector James Whitaker, who said in December that Pietersen would never play for England again. For Pietersen to come back now a lot of people would have to either depart or rebuild some seriously broken bridges. Pietersen's England future lies in the hands of new ECB chairman Colin Graves .

"England's campaign at the European Under 21 Championship looks set to be dominated over whether Harry Kane is included - but Gareth Southgate may not need him. In front of over 30,000 at the Riverside Stadium, England came from behind to defeat Germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the Czech Republic this summer. Southgate is still expected to do everything he can to include the Tottenham striker, but the win over Germany shows that the Young Lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of Europe. Here Sportsmail looks at England's three stand-out stars from the win in Middlesbrough. James Ward-Prowse . The Southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at St Mary's and is set to be a key member of Southgate's side in the Czech Republic. The 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after ghosting into the penalty box to find space. But his attacking play extends to set-pieces. Germany's Julian Korb reaches out in vain as James Ward-Prowse fires home England's winning goal . The Under 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance . In Ward-Prowse, England have potentially their best dead-ball specialist since David Beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game. Ward-Prowse was captain for the Germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on. Carl Jenkinson . Named the official Man of the Match, Jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for Germany's opening goal after allowing the cross for Philipp Hofmann to fire home. But after a slow start to each half, the West Ham full-back, on loan from Arsenal, imposed himself down the right-hand side. Carl Jenkinson runs the ball out of defence for England as Germany substitute Nico Schulz looks on . Jenkinson put in a Man of the Match display having assisted two of England's three goals . It was the 23-year-old's cross for Jesse Lingard which helped draw the Three Lions level in the first half, while he also provided the pass for Ward-Prowse to tuck home the winning goal. With England's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area, Roy Hodgson could do worse than pick Jenkinson. Because if he doesn't, then Finland will as he can still play for the Scandinavian team. Nathan Redmond . Relished the battle with Germany full-back Christian Gunter, often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing. Redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach, with his passing in the final third managing to catch the German back four flat on a number of occasions. Nathan Redmond rifles home England's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner . Redmond celebrates after drawing England level late in the game following an impressive display on the right .

"Five former patients of Desmond D'Mello have tested positive for hepatitis C after claims he ignored infection control rules . Five former patients of a dentist accused of putting lives at risk amid claims he flouted infection control rules, have tested positive for hepatitis C. Desmond D'Mello's alleged refusal to follow NHS safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days. NHS England alerted 22,000 patients after fears they could have been exposed to blood-borne diseases including HIV and hepatitis while being treated at the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham. A total of 4,526 patients were tested and five were diagnosed with hepatitis C as a result, health bosses confirmed. No cases of hepatitis B or HIV were found. The recall was issued in November, and an investigation into apparent breaches of infection control procedures by Mr D'Mello was launched. The dentist, who ran his practice for 32 years, was suspended. Dr Doug Black, Medical Director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said: 'We have always been clear that the risk to patients was low, but we still had a duty to inform patients of this and offer the option for them to be tested. 'Treatments are available for all of the blood-borne viruses tested for, so we are pleased that these individuals have been identified and offered clinical support to aid their well-being. 'Now that this patient screening exercise is complete, we will be focusing our efforts on what we can learn from this incident and ensuring all our findings are shared with the General Dental Council to inform their ongoing investigation into Mr D'Mello.' Mr D'Mello is being investigated by the Care Quality Commission and the General Dental Council after he was secretly filmed by a whistleblower failing to change his medical gloves between patients or properly sterilise equipment. The dentist went to ground after his work was called into question and has never spoken publicly about the allegations. Dr Vanessa MacGregor, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England, East Midlands said: 'With such a high number of people being tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, the small number of positives that have been picked up as a result of screening is in line with what we would expect to see due to the very low prevalence of these blood-borne viruses within the community. 'Effective treatments are available for all blood-borne viruses, which is why it is important to identify anyone who may have been at risk of infection, so treatment can be started if necessary.' Mr D'Mello, who ran the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham, which has now changed name and is under new ownership, sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days amid allegations he failed to follow NHS safety procedures . Patients who tested positive were informed by their GPs and referred for further clinical advice and testing. Since August 2014 the former Daybrook Dental Practice has been under new ownership by Southern Dental, which is not

"Whiskey lovers all over the world claim the key to the perfect bourbon is time. But a catastrophic shortage of whiskey could soon be on the way with anecdotal reports suggesting the demand for bourbon is about to outstrip supply. Now, some distillers have taken heed of the warnings and are coming up with radical new ways to mature whiskey to its full potential faster than ever before. Whiskey lovers all over the world will tell you the key to the perfect bourbon is time. But a catastrophic shortage of whiskey could soon be the way with anecdotal reports suggesting the demand for bourbon is about to outstrip supply . According to a report by Tasha Eichensehert in Nautilus, the popularity of bourbon last year saw 19 million cases sold, generating $2.7 billion in revenue. She claims that through a series of inventive ageing methods, manufacturers have been able to cut the two-to-20-year process into just days and months. The ageing of whiskey usually takes place in 200-litres (53 American gallons) barrels made from seasoned American white oak, Quercus alba. These barrels are charred, breaking down the lignin in the wood into compounds called aldehydes. Adding alcohol to the barrel causes oxidation which transforms the aldehydes into acids. Changes in heat within the barrel then give whiskey its complex flavour. Through a series of inventive ageing methods, manufacturers have been able to cut the two-to-20-year process whiskey ageing process into just days and months . Nautilus reports that Tuthilltown Spirits in Gardiner, New York - the makers of Hudson Baby Bourbon – are now letting the alcohol settle in 2- to 5-gallon oak barrels. This, they say, increases the alcohol-to-barrel-surface ratio, causing the whiskey to mature faster, cutting the time down to around four months. Meanwhile Copper Fox Distillery in Virginia is adding toasted oak chips their barrel, in another attempt to increase the alcohol-to-surface ratio. One distillery in South Carolina claims it has cut the process down to just eight hours. Terressentia, near Charleston, first filters the whiskey in plastic tanks. There are concerns that pubs could become a thing of the past as thousands close each year due to spiralling production costs. But a new machine could help landlords feeling the pinch, because it can produce pints that cost just 35 pence (53 cents) each. The Truebrew Technobrewery can make 280 pints of beer in just two hours at the touch of a button. A similar size to an industrial oven, the machine is intended for business use and will cost around £25,000 ($38,000). The machine allows landlords to brew their own beer for a quarter of the price of buying it in from a brewery. The machine is filled it with water, and then ingredients including hops are placed inside. It's then switched on for two hours. The machine is self-cleaning and the beer is ready to drink seven days later. This speeds up the aldehyde and acid reaction creating chemical compounds that can be consumed in a matter of hours. Entrepreneurs have also created home tools for people

"A newborn baby girl who was found dead inside a garbage can outside an Ohio sorority house last week was born alive and then suffocated, according to the coroner. A preliminary ruling from the Muskingum County coroner on Monday said the baby found at Muskingum University campus was nearly full term when she was born, NBC4 reported. The child's mother is a student at the small school in New Concord, authorities said last week, but they have refused to release her name. Scroll down for video . Found: A newborn girl was found inside the trash outside the Delta Gamma Theta sorority house, pictured, at Muskingum University last Wednesday. It has now emerged the baby was alive when she was born . They interviewed her after the child's body was found on Wednesday night outside the Delta Gamma Theta sorority house on Lakeside Drive. No charges have been filed. A University police officer called the sheriff’s office at around 9pm on Wednesday after he reported seeing a dead newborn outside the building. The body was inside a plastic bag in the garbage can, according to reports. It's the second time a baby has died of asphyxiation at the school, The Times Reporter noted. Jennifer Bryant, then 22, was arrested on involuntary manslaughter and other charges in 2002 after she gave birth to a baby boy in her campus apartment and then put him in the trash. He later died. Bryant, who was a student at the school, pleaded guilty and was sentenced in to three years in prison in 2003, but she was released after seven months. Tragic: It is the second time an abandoned baby has died at the university campus in eastern Ohio. In 2002, the body of a baby boy was found in a dumpster and his mother served seven months in prison . Ohio has a Safe Haven Law that's been in place since 2001 allowing mothers of newborns to anonymously leave their child at a hospital or fire station. The newborn is then placed with child services and hopefully then put in a loving home. As long as the newborn shows no sign of abuse or neglect then the mother does not face any legal charges. Muskingum University, which is about 70 miles east of Columbus, has 3,000 students. See below for video .

"From underground bunkers and tactical bicycles to heavily armored vehicles, they were taught new ways to deal with a zombie apocalypse or a natural disaster - and also met some TV stars. Hundreds of survivalists and so-called 'Preppers', of all ages and levels of 'experience', descended on the Salt Lake City, Utah, suburb of Sandy on Friday for the nation's first ever PrepperCon. During the two-day expo, they were shown specially-equipped underground bunkers, learned new methods of storing food, tried out solar powered flashlights - and even dressed up as zombies. They were also greeted by actors from the AMC hit show 'The Walking Dead', including Addy Miller, who took pictures with fans and acted as a judge in an emergency preparedness food cook-off.

Above, an image tweeted by PrepperCon organizers . Scott Stallings, one of PrepperCon's founders, said the event was inspired by ComicCon's success, adding that he had amped up the entertainment with the hope of attracting younger attendees. He said that Utah made sense for America's first expo because of the Mormon culture's emphasis on food storage and self-reliance. Among the expo's main events was a zombie costume contest. 'In the prepping industry, we look at zombies as a metaphor,' said Mr Stallings, who lives in Murray. 'Anyone that's coming to take away your stuff, your safety, inflict harm on your family.' Vendors who filled the South Towne Expo Center on Friday and Saturday showed off an array of gear to help people survive a zombie apocalypse, a natural disaster or life in the wilderness. This gear included knives of all shapes and sizes, hi-tech gadgets, food storage units, first aid supplies and armored trucks. There were also live demonstrations and the survival cooking contest.

"Saturday Night Live pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining ISIS, and not the US Army, at the end. The segment was laid out the same as the recent My Bold Dad spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his Toyota Camry. The spot that first aired during the 2015 Super Bowl and was seen as a touching look at what it is like to say goodbye for those that have family members in the service. In this version however, the father, played by Taran Killam, dropped off his daughter, played by Dakota Johnson, and as he tearfully said goodbye she says to him; 'Dad, it's just ISIS.' Scroll down for video . Dakota Johnson (above) played a young girl joining ISIS in a skit on Saturday Night Live . The skit ended with the tagline; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad' There was even a vehicle with the ISIS flag in the skit . This is the first time that Johnson, the star of Fifty Shades of Grey, has hosted Saturday Night Live . From there, Johnson jumped on a truck with actors playing members of the Islamic State and with a mock flag, which actually appears to read; 'I would like a cat.' When the father then says to take care of his girl, one of the men yells; 'Death to America.' Then, as the commercial ended, a message appeared on screen; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad.' Johnson winked at her father to assure him everything was all right in the parody . Some on twitter found the parody 'depraved' Others on twitter found the bit 'hysterical' Johnson teels her father not to worry saying, 'Dad, it's just ISIS' This all comes on the same week three men were arrested in the United States with ties to the terrorist organization and three female British teenagers left to join the group. The skit was met with outrage by many on Twitter, who took the program to task for being insensitive. 'Can't be serious. Isis skit? Like going to college? When so many people are being kidnapped and killed?Depraved,' wrote Raine LaChance. 'Apparently NBC and SNL thought it was funny to have a skit showing ISIS driving to an airport to pick up an American girl. Tasteless Scum!,' said Jim Ematrudo. Others however found the skit 'hilarious.' This also comes the same week that the identity of ISIS member Jihadi John was revealed and the group destroyed a collection of priceless statues and sculptures in Iraq dating back thousands of years in Mosul. John is British citizen Mohammed Emwazi, the man who is responsible for the high-profile beheadings of Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Steven Sotliff as well as British citizens David Haines and Alan Henning in the name of the terrorist organization. His identity was previously unknown as he always wears a mask. Canada this week also said that they believe four missing teenagers may have traveled to

The car-crazy brothers from Port Canaveral, Florida, started building versions of the vehicles they most loved for their own enjoyment four years ago. Marc, 45, said: 'We didn't have the money to pay people to customise vehicles for us, and what we needed didn't exist so we had to learn to build our parts. 'Every part of the Tumbler was made from scratch in our shop - the frame, chassis, wheels, glass, everything. 'I don't know what it cost to build - I'd probably cry if I looked into it - but as far as value, it's one of the most expensive vehicles we own.' Prime mover: A truck made to look like autobot Optimus Prime in last year's Transformers: Age of Extinction . Neat fleet: Marc (left) and Shanon show off their Tron-inspired bike and other vehicles at their workshop . He and Shanon, 44, have now turned their hobby into a business - called Parker Brothers Concepts - and they hire out their movie-inspired cars and motorbikes to fans.

"Ministers have ordered an inquiry into Jihadi John's secondary school after it emerged that two other former pupils went on to become terrorists. Education secretary Nicky Morgan has ordered an urgent investigation into the school after it emerged two dead Islamist fighters were also taught at Quintin Kynaston Academy in north London. Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, was killed fighting with terrorists in Syria in 2013 after joining up with an al-Qaeda group, while Mohammed Sakr, 27, died fighting for Al-Shabbab in Somalia. Their deaths and the fact Jihadi John was revealed as former pupil Mohammed Emwazi last week has raised questions over what measures are in place to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers. Ministers have ordered an urgent investigation into the school attended by Mohammed Emwazi (pictured left) after it emerged two dead extremist fighters - including Choukri Ellekhlifi (right) - were also taught there . Yesterday the Government announced an urgent internal review into whether enough had been done at the school. Mrs Morgan has ordered officials to examine all evidence, including school records and inspection findings, to establish whether enough was done to prevent teenagers becoming radicalised. The Department for Education review aims to help officials understand how to prevent pupils or former pupils becoming extremists and travelling 'to Syria or other areas of concern', a spokesman said. The spokesman added: 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review all schools that fit this category. 'Our understanding of the challenge, and the way we monitor the ability of schools to respond to it, has advanced hugely in the past few years. Quintin Kynaston Academy's (pictured) head insisted the school is 'not a breeding ground for terrorists' 'As part of this, this government set-up a dedicated Due Diligence and Counter Extremism division within the DfE and they are working tirelessly to develop our understanding of the problem and to see if and where we can offer help to schools with pupils or former pupils who have since travelled to Syria or other areas of concern. 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review those schools where we have evidence of links with pupils who have travelled to Syria. 'The allegations about Quintin Kynaston may be historic and it is clearly a completely different school today, but I'm sure we will look back at the evidence from the time as part of this review to see if there are any lessons we can learn for the future.' The Telegraph reports both Ellekhlifli and Sakr were 'close associates' of Emwazi. Ellekhlifi was fighting alongside al-Qaeda linked extremists in Syria when he was killed by government forces near the city of Aleppo on August 11, 2013. The Department for Education review aims to help officials understand how to prevent pupils or former pupils becoming extremists and travelling 'to Syria or other areas of concern' - pictured: Jihadi John in an ISIS video .

"A drunken woman was arrested after police say she forced her 7-year-old daughter to spend the night in a dumpster outside a spa in a crime-ridden section of Dallas. Alicia Carroll, of Garland, faces a charge of abandoning and endangering a child. The 28-year-old remained in Dallas County Jail Monday on $25,000 bond. Police say Carroll called police Sunday morning saying the person she left her daughter with on Saturday night would not return the child. Bad parenting: Alicia Carroll, 28, has been charged with child endangerment after Dallas police say she made her daughter sleep alone in a dumpster . But according to police documents, the 7-year-old girl said her mother told her to 'hide' in the trash bin after the two exited the popular King Spa and Sauna on Royal Lane. Officers found the little girl 10 hours later after being flagged down by citizens who saw her looking filthy and barefoot. When she was interviewed by police, Miss Carroll said she had been drinking at the spa and at around 10pm stepped out to 'clear her head,' leaving her daughter inside with an acquaintance, reported Dallas Morning News. However, a King Spa worker told NBC 5 that the mother and daughter left the establishment together after attending a party with friends. When police finally caught up with the 7-year-old girl at around 11.15am Sunday, she told them that when she and her mother left the spa, Carroll suddenly took off running. The child claimed that Carroll told her they were being pursued by police and had to go into hiding. According to investigators, Carroll then placed her daughter in a garbage container in a 'high-crime' area and fled. The little girl eventually fell asleep amid refuse and woke up only 10 hours later. She was able to scramble out of the dumpster and began walking down Royal Lane towards the spa. Passersby spotted her on the street walking without shoes and called police. Officers who responded to the scene described the child as thirsty, hungry, and covered in filth and cuts to her arms and legs. Night out: Carroll was drinking with friends and her daughter in tow at King Spa and Sauna in a high-crime section of Dallas Saturday night . Mistreated: Carroll's 7-year-old child (right) was discovered barefoot, hungry, thirsty and covered in filth and bruises . Excuse: The 28-year-old initially told police she had left her daughter with an acquaintance so she could 'clear her head' who then refused to give the child back . When pressed about the incident, Alicia Carroll admitted that she became inebriated after downing two vodka drinks in the spa parking lot and did not remember after happened later. Carroll returned to the spa at around 9.45am the following day looking for her daughter, but the child was not there and employees could not tell her where she’d gone. The mother then called police, setting off a frantic ground and air search, which ended when a Good Samaritan called them to report seeing the girl wandering down Royal Lane. The 7-year-old

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely detached scene for the close of America's longest war: military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar, high security bases, on Black Hawks, miles from the front line. But it is how Washington wants this to be. And even though the departure of American troops will be fractionally slower, they will all be inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year, making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire. We are near Jalalabad, at a regional logistics hub for the Afghan police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms, ammunition, even fuel for vehicles. The intentions, first hatched in 2011 when the U.S. had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here, were large in scale. But the project has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception. We are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks. Dozens of Afghan police gather there, and mill around, waiting for their commanders to arrive. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: Afghan forced to marry her rapist . Yet a few problems are immediately visible. There are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we're told they've been removed while a new master key is being sought. There seem to be few supplies in the actual hub. We ask the Afghan policemen how many of them get resupplied there, at this stage, four months since it opened, and they say: none. About 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base, but supplies often still come from where they did before -- Kabul. U.S. officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the Afghan army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need. But here, now, that seems far away. As does the base, incidentally. It's quite a rough drive from the main road, surrounded by hills, and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: ISIS recruits in Taliban territory . And it is far away in terms of its cost. Like so much in the most costly of wars, its price tag may have made sense in briefings on Capitol Hill, where effectiveness is gauged in millions, but here in dusty eastern Afghanistan, it seems exorbitant. This as-yet, partially functional resupply hub cost $21 million, a price that presumably includes new doorhandles. There are about fifty Afghan police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $400,000 to the US taxpayer. But this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the U.S. trainers here face: working, as they are, against a clock, with diminishing resources and public interest, in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where, when the Taliban aren't thriving,

"A wartime scientist has revisited the secret underground factory where she helped build aircraft engines 70 years since the end of the Second World War. Mary Cartwright was 20 when she was called up to work in the laboratory at Drakelow Shadow Factory in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, in 1943. She spent two years testing metal for Bristol aircraft engines in the site's underground laboratory, working as the only woman in her department.

She worked as the only woman in its laboratory between 1943 and 1945 . Built in 1943, the factory became known as Drakelow Tunnels for its vast network of underground paths spread over three-and-a-half miles. It was one of 26 'shadow' sites set-up to mass produce engines and parts for military aircraft and tanks that were built underground or into hillside so that production could continue if bombed. Designed by Rover at the behest of the Air Ministry, Drakelow employed 700 people when Mrs Cartwright began working there.

"Just like humans learning to talk, puppies can sometimes take a while to learn to bark. At least, that seemed to be the case for one young Shibu Inu, who caused hilarity with a somewhat chatty display at an American Kennel Club centre. The pup was filmed squeaking and squawking after meeting a young husky dog and attempting to bark at its new companion. Captured on video, the puppies are held in the air by their respective handlers and one of the dogs makes a high-pitched whining sound. Opening its mouth, the Shibu Inu then begins vocalising with a yappy bark before the husky – leaning back in its handler’s arm – whines. People standing by laugh and put their hands to their mouths as a staff member turns to address and pacify the dog. The puppy Shibu Inu and husky feature opposite one another while conversing at an American Kennel Club centre . Falling quiet for a second, the Shibu Inu pipes up once more – louder than before – causing the husky to respond. As the dogs continue to converse, the video maker asks with a giggle: ‘What is that noise?’ But it is barely audible over the sounds of the intense barking, whining and yapping. Later in the video the excited Shibu Inu begins running in its owner's arms in its attempts to get closer to the husky. Passers-by laugh and film the two dogs as they begin yapping, whining and barking at one another . And people in the video can be seen laughing while mimicking the dog’s erratic and entirely humorous actions. The video concludes with the husky losing interest slightly and chewing on its handler’s sleeve. Before the same handler speaks to the Shibu Inu and gives it a rub, causing it to momentarily settle down. A staff member from the American Kennel Club centre attempts to pacify the puppy by giving it a rub . Canine vocalisation usually begins when a puppy is around two-to-three-weeks-old and generally consists of grunts and whines. At seven-to-eight-weeks-old, the vocalisation will develop into stronger sounding barks, although some dogs wait as long as 16 weeks before even making an attempt.

"Gaffe: Broadcaster John Inverdale, pictured, excused his foul language as a 'slip of the tongue' BBC presenter John Inverdale was forced to apologise after swearing during radio coverage of the Cheltenham Festival. Speaking on BBC 5 Live, the veteran broadcaster accidentally said 'rose-c***ed' glasses when reflecting on the career of former jockey John Francome. He quickly corrected himself and apologised before explaining it had been a 'slip of the tongue'. Inverdale made the embarrassing gaffe while interviewing Francome and rising racing star Lizzie Kelly earlier today. Francome, who became a racing pundit after retiring from the sport, said: 'You get wet, you're mucking out, and it's hard work. 'But through all of that it's a way of life that most of them wouldn't swap, a lot of people go off and do other things and then come back to it.' To which Inverdale replied: 'This is looking at it through rose-c***ed, rose-tinted glasses from the past... I apologise there for a slip of the tongue, but Lizzie your love of the sport just shines through.' Kelly, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in the last 12 months, struggled not to laugh as she said: Oh yeah, because, as I've said it's very important to love it or you wouldn't do it otherwise.' It is not the first time that Inverdale's language has landed him in trouble. He made headlines last year when he said 't**t' during an interview with former tennis World No. 1 tennis star Jim Courier during French Open coverage.

Speaking the following year, Inverdale said that he knew that he had committed a gaffe but that his BBC training meant that he did not say sorry.

"A short circuit has temporarily rendered Nasa's Curiosity rover inactive as engineers investigate the problem. The Mars rover stopped work when an electrical problem was discovered while it was using its arm to move powder into its sample container. The severity of the problem is not yet known, but Nasa said they expected to resume operations in several days if it can be resolved. A short circuit occurred in the rover's arm as it was moving. Nasa engineers in California are now investigating the problem. The rover (shown here in a recent mosaic image taken by its arm) had been transferring rock powder into a sample analysis container . 'We are running tests on the vehicle in its present configuration before we move the arm or drive,' said Curiosity Project Manager Jim Erickson, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'This gives us the best opportunity to determine where the short is.' The short circuit occurred while the rover was moving its arm on 27 February. When the rover detected the anomaly, it stopped the movement of its arm. Nasa said that such a brief short could have little effect on rover operations, or it 'could prompt the rover team to restrict use of a mechanism'. Quite how much lasting damage the short will have caused, if any, is not yet known. On Twitter the official account for the rover, @MarsCuriosity, said: 'Call me Johnny Five. Some ops on hold while my team investigates a short circuit.' The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. The fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover. This powder was taken from a rocket target called Telegraph Peak. Curiosity has successfully analysed five samples from drilling targets before in 2013 and 2014, but this is the first time this problem has arisen. On this particular occasion, Curiosity revealed the true colour of Mars was not red - but blue and grey. By drilling a few centimetres into the ground, the drill dug up material that had a different colouration to the surface. The fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover. This powder was taken from a rocket target called Telegraph Peak. The material appears blueish-grey, seen here, because it had not yet oxidised in the Martian air . The reason is that Mars is mostly made of silicon and oxygen, and also contains significant quantities of iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium and potassium. When the soil is exposed to the air it oxidises and 'rusts', giving it its red appearance. 'We're sort of seeing a new colouration for Mars here, and

"The oldest active pilot is a 95-year-old man living in Cameron Park, California. Guinness World Records has confirmed Peter Weber Jr.'s feat, the Sacramento Bee reported. 'I'm overwhelmed,' Weber told the newspaper. 'I'm getting all kinds of phone calls, emails and all that stuff.' Pilot: The oldest active pilot is a 95-year-old Peter Weber Jr., it's been revealed (March 2015 photo) Active: Weber has said he flies 'at least twice a month.' He also still has his driver's license (March 2015 file photo) The record was confirmed after Weber proved he piloted a plane March 30 in Placerville by mailing in multiple pieces of evidence, according to the Sacramento Bee. The newspaper reported that Weber's flight experience goes back decades: he flew in both World War II and the Vietnam War, and also served as a Korean War flight instructor. All told, Guinness World Records says on its website that 'Peter has been a pilot for 72 years.' According to Guinness, Weber was a flight cadet in 1943. 'Peter went on to become a Lieutenant Colonel in the US Air Force,' the website says. 'He retired from the Air Force in 1970, and since then has flown for recreational purposes.' Weber pulled off his March 30 flight at the age of 95 years and 143 days, Guinness says. Weber told the Sacramento Bee in March 'The reason I did it is because I though maybe I might have the record be - being the fact my age is 95 years, 4 months and 23 days.' Years of experience: Weber reportedly was a flight cadet in 1943 and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1970 (March 2015 file photo) At the time, he said that Guinness recently made a new category for the oldest qualified pilot who still has a license and flies alone while speaking to the newspaper. Weber has been married to his wife since 1943 and is a father to a 70-year-old son, according to reports. The Sacramento Bee reported Weber still has his driver's license -- and also pointed out that a since-deceased 105-year-old Colorado man holds the record for being the oldest pilot ever, according to Guinness. Cole Kugel's final flight took place in 2007 before he died that June, Guinness says.

Mr Byng, from Bristol, was in a hide ‘with the intention of photographing small British birds, such as Bullfinches, Long-tailed Tits and Wrens as part of a relaxing day’s photography.’ However Mr Byng’s relaxing day’s photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye. ‘I suddenly saw it break into a run towards the geese so I quickly moved my camera and lens to focus on the fox,’ explained the married Grandfather-of-nine. ‘I had no time to change any settings on my camera but managed to capture the action as he tried to take down the goose.’ Gotcha! The fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird . Escape: The goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake . The retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey. ‘The fox was on a search for food, evidently being hungry enough to tackle a large goose. ‘It broke into a run in an effort to take one of the geese, who at the last moment caught sight of his approach. ‘Whilst one of the geese clears the grass and rises into the air quite quickly, the other one was slower to rise enabling the fox to get close. Spitting feathers! The unsuccessful fox drops back down to earth . ‘It jumped into the air to make a grab, with jaws open and teeth displayed. It is the good fortune of the goose that he gained just sufficient height that the fox was only able to get a bite on his tail feathers. ‘The fox came away with a single feather, whilst the goose escaped with a squawk!’ The wetlands that the pictures were taken on are managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and can be accessed by paying a small fee or by taking out an annual membership granting you entry to all of the sites in the UK. Mr Byng adds: ‘Slimbridge is a wonderful location for witnessing the activity of a large number of birds and wildlife, including migratory species such as Bewick Swans.’

"These dramatic photographs capture the moment seven unexploded shells were detonated out at sea. The 40lb shells, which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador named after Sir Barnes Wallis - the inventor of the bouncing bomb. His owner, John Brewin, phoned the emergency services after his dog dug up one of the shells during a walk in Sandwich Bay, Kent, on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: The seven shells were detonated by bomb experts out at sea at Sanwich Bay, Kent . Explosion: The shells, which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador . Sniffed out: Barnes Wallis the black Labrador . Experts from the Royal Logistics Corps Bomb Disposal Team arrived and, with Barnes' help, uncovered another six shells. They were taken out into the sea where they were safely detonated. Mr Brewin said it was not the first time his dog had found explosives. He said: 'These are not the first he has found.' 'The seven shells date from the 1860s and are 40lb Black Powder shells. 'The first one was found by my black Labrador Barnes Wallis and the others were then located by the local Coastguard Team, assisted by Barnes again.' Mr Brewin named his dog after Sir Barnes Wallis, a British aviation engineer who invented the 'bouncing bomb' used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. Adrian Hendry, 43, who lives nearby, said: 'The explosion out at sea was incredible - a real blast. 'It's amazing that the dog that sniffed the bombs out is named after Barnes Wallis - an amazing coincidence really.' Uncovered: Bomb disposal experts arrived and, with Barnes' help, found another six shells on the beach . Curious: Owner John Brewin said the shells, pictured, are not the first to be dug up by his pet . Sir Barnes Wallis: Inventor of the 'bouncing bomb' Barnes Wallis was a British aviation engineer who is famous for designing the 'bouncing bomb' that was used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. Born in Derbyshire, Wallis worked first as for a marine engineering firm before transferring to working on aircraft. When the Second World War began, Wallis was assistant chief designer of aviation at Vickers' engineering. He came up with the concept behind the bouncing bomb while skipping his daughter's marbles across a tub of water by catapault. But it took more than a year to convince RAF chiefs that such a bomb might work and should be attempted. Once he was given the go-ahead, he had only eight weeks to complete and test the design. The final solution, called Upkeep, was a cylindrical bomb, weighing four tons, spinning backwards at 500 rpm. It had to be dropped from precisely 60ft above the water at not more than 240mph. In the dark. In the middle of hilly, forested west German territory. Operation Chastise, dubbed the 'Dambusters Raid' was carried out overnight on the 16 May 1943 by the 617 Squadron of the RAF - specially-created for the job - that

"When Tony Ansell was given an Airfix kit at was six-years-old, it was something of an inspiration. Twenty years on the keen model maker has created a fleet of radio controlled warships at his workshop in Ferndown in Dorset. Each warship is made to scale, using original Royal Navy blueprints and photographs to ensure they capture a snapshot in time when the vessels were in action. Model maker Tony Ansell spent the last 20 years making scale models of radio controlled navy warships. His Dorset workshop features models of HMS Campbeltown (top), HMS Hood (middle) and HMS Fencer (bottom) Mr Ansell, a former plumber, uses original Royal Navy blueprints to make the scale models of the warships . And so dedicated is the former plumber to his craft that he is in the process of writing to the Queen to ask for permission to name one of his ships - a G3 battlecruiser - Beatty because the original was cancelled and therefore never named. 'You need to put in the research and I tend to pick a particular time in the ship's life to make it at because warships went in for refits lots and could be different from year to year,' said Mr Ansell, 63. 'I like to make ships you don't see at model shows very often and bigger ones are more of a challenge because you have to be more detailed.' Mr Ansell uses fibreglass to make the hull of the ships and flexible sheets of 1mm thick plastic for the rest of the structure. He researches each of the vessels before he makes them, using photographs to ensure accuracy. Most of the other items such as guns and aircraft are made from resin and mini Airfix kits. Constructing the models is a painstaking process, sometimes taking longer than it took to make the actual warships themselves. It took nine years for Mr Ansell to complete HMS Dreadnought laying each of the planks individually . Replica fighter planes sit on the deck of one of Mr Ansell's boats that make up his fleet of model warships . HMS Campbeltown was an American ship that was eventually transferred to the Royal Navy in 1940 . Mr Ansell's most recent build, the battleship HMS Dreadnought, is a 6ft long, 1:196 scale model and has as taken him nine years to finish - nine times longer than it took to build the actual warship in 1906. But the project was delayed by a lack of photographs of the vessel and he built two other models during that time. He has also made models of aircraft carrier HMS Fencer, HMS Campbeltown and HMS Hood, the ship sunk by the Germans in World War Two. As well as his scale warships, Mr Ansell has also created replicas of tanks, keeping them all to precise scale . The 63-year-old makes the models in his Dorset workshop and is seen consulting an original blueprint . The HMS Dreadnought replica (left) was the most time consuming of all Mr Ansell's models and each additional part, from aircraft

"(CNN)NASA astronaut Scott Kelly has started a trip to the record books. He plans to spend 342 days on the International Space Station -- the longest stretch of time any U.S. astronaut has spent in space. Kelly lifted off Friday aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket that launched from Kazakhstan. The rocket docked at the ISS at 9:33 p.m. ET, according to a tweet from NASA, with hatches between the Soyuz and the space station scheduled to open about 11:15 p.m. ET. Kelly will stay twice as long as any U.S. astronaut has ever stayed on the space station, giving scientists a chance to study how the human body responds to long-duration space flights. On Earth, scientists will perform parallel studies on Scott Kelly's identical twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. ""It's a lot of fun,"" Kelly said at a media briefing in January. ""Space station is a magical place."" Two cosmonauts are riding up with Kelly: Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka. Kornienko also will stay up for a year. Padalka will only stay up for six months. The trio will join three crew members already on the space station: U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. Other crew members also will rotate in and out during their year in orbit so it will never be just Kelly and Kornienko on the station. Kelly, 51, hopes to break the record for the longest mission on the space station set by NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin. They spent over seven months on the ISS -- from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. He is expected to spend 342 days off the planet on this mission. When added to his previous space missions, that would give him a total of 522 days in space, breaking the record of U.S. astronaut Mike Fincke. Fincke spent a combined 381 days, 15 hours and 11 minutes in space, according to his official NASA bio. While Kelly shoots to set space station and other U.S. records, Padalka is on schedule to set a record for the most total time in space for a human. He's already spent more than 710 days in space, including stays on Russia's Mir space station and three previous stints on the International Space Station. Why do it? Why stay up on the station so long? NASA wants to know more about the impact of long-duration spaceflights on the human body to help plan missions to Mars and deeper into space. And the space station, in orbit 250 miles above Earth, is the best place available to study that. Spending that much time in a weightless environment will take a toll. NASA says space station astronauts have vision changes, bone loss, muscle atrophy and other problems. NASA says the experiments should have benefits on Earth, such as helping patients recover from long periods of bed rest to improved monitoring of people whose bodies are unable to fight infections. The space station has about the same living space as a six-bedroom, two bathroom house. And

"(CNN)Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen on Thursday, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war, potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the Middle East. The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets, 30 from the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain, 10 from Qatar, and a handful from Jordan, Morocco and Sudan, plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt, according to a Saudi adviser. The Egyptian state news agency on Thursday quoted Egypt's Foreign Ministry as saying Egypt's support also could involve ground forces. What do those countries have in common? They're all predominantly Sunni Muslim -- in contrast to the Houthi rebels, Shiite Muslims who have taken over Yemen's capital of Sanaa and on Wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city, Aden. The Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. ""What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,"" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The airstrikes did not include warplanes from the United States, which has worked with Yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- to go after al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said ""there will be no military intervention by the U.S."" But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday did tell foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, according to a senior State Department official. How did Yemen get to this place? Houthi supreme leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, ""If any army try to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us."" He added, ""We call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner."" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's monthslong internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. ""This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,"" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iraq -- 60% of whose citizens are Shiite, with about 20% being Sunnis -- offered similar, albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its Foreign Ministry called ""the military interference of the Gulf Cooperation Council,"" which is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

"Everywhere you go on the Isle of Man, you'll see Manx flags - three conjoined white legs on a red background. For the Manx, the Triskelion is a powerful symbol of independent spirit and endurance, the motto being: 'Whichever way you throw, it will stand.' Lately, it's become a symbol for me too, of three islands. There's the island I've called home for the past 11 years, the island I write about in my novels, and somewhere in between, perhaps, a deeper truth about this beautiful rock in the middle of the Irish Sea. Independent spirit: The harbour at Ramsey, the Isle of Man's second biggest town . Legend: A carving of the sea god Manannan . Can a place with a reputation for being safe and sleepy really also be home to spies, killers and evil spirits that feature in my books? I like to think so, and here are a few reasons why. The weather might be mixed but the landscape is dramatic, whether seen from the sea, walking the coast path, or taking the electric railway to the top of the island's solitary mountain, Snaefell (from where, on a clear day, you can see the distant humped blurs of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales). The rich variety of locations is something I've grown to appreciate in my books, and something the Isle of Man film industry has thrived on during the past decade. Need a spooky cottage? The island has plenty. The same goes for lush glens and lonely coves. But the island provides more than great backdrops. It's compact, with a population in the region of 85,000, and while that makes it ideally manageable for a weekend visit, it also fosters something all writers rely on - rumours and hearsay. My first Isle of Man-set thriller, Safe House, grew out of a rumour I heard almost as soon as I moved here - namely, that it's used as a place to relocate people enrolled in UK witness protection schemes. Is the rumour true? I don't know for certain, but it seems credible to me. The island is isolated and has lots of out-of-the-way spots. The Isle of Man also its own very distinct identity. Where else could the population swell for a fortnight every June in celebration of a controversial motorbike festival that pits man against machine over a course run on almost 38 miles of public roads? The Isle of Man is isolated, with some out of the way spots, lush glens and lonely coves . Racing glory: Every summer the island hosts the world-famous TT races, with motorbikes reaching 200mph . The TT (Tourist Trophy) races have been in existence since 1907, with recent competitors recording top speeds of 200mph. But while most islanders are proud of the long tradition of racing greats who have tamed the course, the event is not without its critics. Like many others, I find it hard to reconcile the number of fatalities that have occurred with the racing glory, but I can't fail to admire how brave the riders must

"Crime and punishment: Erica Ginnetti, 35, has been sentenced to 30 days, house arrest and probation for having sex with a 17-year-old student . A disgraced Pennsylvania math teacher has been sentenced to 30 days in jail, house arrest and probation for having sex with a 17-year-old student and sending him X-rated photos. Erica Ann Ginneti, 35, a married mother of three from Philadelphia, pleaded guilty in December to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor. The former math and calculus teacher at Lower Moreland Township School District had been facing seven to 14 years in prison, but on Friday Judge Garrett Page sentenced her to 3-23 months, including the first 30 days in jail and the next 60 on house arrest. She also faces three years’ probation, 100 hours of community service and will have to register as a sex offender for the next 25 years, according to The Intelligencer. Ginneti’s jail terms begins April 10. In court Friday, Mrs Ginneti wept as she read a letter of apology in hopes of offering the victim 'closure for this nightmare.' Prosecutors said the boy had seen his grades drop in his senior year and has been struggling with social interactions. The former educator described for the court how she has reconciled with her family and embarked on a new career as a fitness instructor. In her time off, she volunteers at a church, reported Philadelphia Inquirer. Judge Garrett Page told Ginneti he was certain she would continue to turn her life around, but he reminded her that her ill-thought actions had had devastating consequences. 'One bad day because of sexual hunger has resulted in all this avalanche of harm,' Page stated. He also chastised her for sending her male student explicit photos and videos of herself, which he likened to ‘dangling candy’ in front of the boy. The judge later clarified that he does not think the defendant is a 'bad human being,' but stated she must be punished for her ‘bad act.’ Ginnetti, pictured above with her husband, first approached her victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym . Ginneti's attorney asked the judge to spare her jail time so she could care for her small children. She was fired by Lower Moreland Township School District after her arrest in January. According to investigators, the math and calculus teacher first approached the victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym. A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis. The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, she sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times. According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July

"A millionaire accused of making child pornography with two teenage girls has said that he thought the alleged victims were of-age women who worked at a strip club. Burton Gersh, 69, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, is accused of producing hundreds of sexually explicit photos of two girls, aged 16 and 17, in his lavish mansion beginning in 2010. He asked a federal judge to allow a 'mistake-of-age defense' in his pending trial in which he faces pornography charges. Burton Gersh (pictured above) is accused of producing hundreds of sexually explicit photos of two girls, aged 16 and 17, in his lavish mansion beginning in the fall of 2010 with accomplice Les Sidweber . The former seafood wholesaler also requested in a motion filed in federal court that jurors know the girls engaged in prostitution, according to USA Today. A federal prosecutor is reportedly fighting both requests. 'The alleged victims appeared to be over the age of 18 and both were strippers in a club in Philadelphia, presumably fooling a legitimate business about their age,' the motion from Gersh's attorney, Michael Engle, said. The motion adds that Gersh 'may not have reasonably been able to ascertain the alleged victims' ages because of their misrepresentations, physical appearance and stated occupation'. 'At least one' of the girls was given a release form to sign before the photo school, the motion said. Signing the motion would indicate 'that she was 18 years of age or older'. Gersh and his accomplice, photographer Les Sidweber, 73, were arrested and have been in federal custody since November 3. Their trial is set for May 19. One of the girls was allegedly approached while walking out of her school in her school uniform and encouraged to go to one of the defendant's houses for a modeling shoot. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Louis Lappen told CBS Philadelphia in November. One of the victims said that she was approached while walking out of school in her school uniform and encouraged to go to one of the defendant's houses for a modeling shoot. Illicit pictures show characteristics of Gersh's home, pictured above, investigators said . The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court claims that Gersh and Sidweber paid for the two Pennsylvania girls to come to their homes, strip naked and perform sex acts on one another and on Gersh. 'Once these men earned the trust of these victims, they exploited them on multiple occasions,' Lappen said. The illicit pictures show identifiable characteristics of Gersh's home, including one with a backyard gazebo that featured a sign 'Welcome to the Gershs', investigators told CBS Philadelphia. The defense claims that knowledge of the ages of the girls is crucial if Gersh is found guilty of 'purposefully' producing the child porgography. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan, however, said the mistake-of-age defense should not be taken into account. 'Knowledge that the victim was under the age of 18 is not an element of the crime,' Morgan said in a motion. She also said that allowing testimony on the victims' sexual experiences would be irrelevant and

"House prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace, forecasts show. Property prices soared by 10 per cent in 2014 but will grow by just 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year, it is claimed. It follows last year’s record price hike of 17.4 per cent in the capital. Economists said that the housing market had ‘got ahead of itself’ last year and would assume a much more leisurely pace in 2015. Scroll down for video . Forecasts show house prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace. File photo . Annual price growth across the country will then gradually accelerate again over the next five years, hitting 4 per cent by 2020. This year will be the first since 2009 that the UK as a whole out-performs London, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. This is because while prices in the capital stagnate, the housing market is still performing well in the East and South-East, and parts of the Midlands and North of England. But the CEBR said this victory for the provinces would be short-lived, since the London market will also recover in 2016. Prices there are set to rise by 2.7 per cent next year, above the national average of 2.3 per cent. London homes will also suffer no more price falls in the foreseeable future – and are forecast to see annual growth of an estimated 4.7 per cent by 2020. The predictions from economists at the think-tank were upgraded from their forecast in January, when they suggested average prices would fall this year. They said that radical changes to stamp duty had given the market a boost. In recent years many Britons had been deterred from moving home for fear of the punitive tax on house purchases. The tax was charged on the whole value of a property and successive governments had failed to increase thresholds, trapping growing numbers of families above a £125,000 threshold. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year. File photo . But, in December, the Coalition overhauled the system, replacing the unfair ‘slab’ structure with gradually increasing rates, which cut tax bills for the vast majority of movers. Economist Scott Corfe, of the CEBR, said: ‘House price growth in the UK will rise much slower than last year – but it will still be positive. ‘The market got a bit ahead of itself last year, and at the end of 2014 it began slowing down and plateaued. ‘It has now started to pick up again outside London. We are still not building enough houses to keep pace with population growth so, as long as we have a shortage of supply, prices will keep rising. ‘House prices will continue to grow faster than inflation.’ It was a different story in London, however, where he said interest from overseas buyers had dwindled,

"A woman who lost half her leg to bone cancer had her foot reattached backwards - and it wasn't a mistake. Shanna Decker, 24, was seven when she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma after complaining about a pain in her leg. Doctors said they would have to remove her left knee to save her life. But instead of an amputation, Decker opted for a 'rotationplasty': when the foot is attached to the thigh and rotated backwards. It means Decker, from Minnesota, has more control over her prosthetic calf. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Choice: Shanna Decker, 24, opted to have her left foot reattached to her thigh backwards after doctors removed her left knee. The operation, which removed a cancerous tumor, saved her life . The forward-facing heel acts as a new knee and the foot can move like a shin. If she needs to, Decker can even apply weight to the foot - which has retained its feeling - and walk on it. The then-novel procedure was one of three options available to Decker, while she endured a grueling chemotherapy program. Doctors could have amputated her leg below the thigh or created a 'stiff leg'. More control: The decision Decker and her parents made when she was seven (left) means that she now has more control over her prosthetic leg and can manoeuvre it better than if she had undergone an amputation . Delighted: Seven-year-old Decker was amazed at how quickly she learned to walk again after surgery . Due to her age, Decker was not eligible for 'limb salvage', where the missing tissue is replaced with transplanted or artificial tissue, as her legs were not fully developed. Instead, she opted for rotationplasty, which removes the tumor and the knee and rotates the foot 180 degrees. Writing on Rotationplasty.com, her mother said: 'I remember this being the hardest decision our family has ever faced. When we initially learned of rotationplasty, I have to admit, it took time to absorb. We had many questions and desperately wanted to connect with others who had already chosen this procedure, but found that to be difficult.' No regrets: Decker has now set up a foundation to help children who are considering rotationplasty too . Aside from the difficulty overcoming the appearance of her new leg, Decker said she never thought twice about it. And learning to walk was simple - unlike the months-long process most amputees endure. 'As soon as my leg healed, I was walking with a prosthetic and it took me about three seconds to learn how to rewalk,' Decker told Everyday Health. Hoping to inspire children who are facing the same predicament she tackled 17 years ago, Decker has founded a charity called Brighter Tomorrows that supports young cancer sufferers.

"Following Sunday's El Clasico spectacle that hugely intensified the run-in for the La Liga title between Barcelona and Real Madrid, Rio Ferdinand gave his stance on the age-old debate of who is better: Cristano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi? Choosing to stay somewhat impartial to the discussion the former England international says we should stand back and appreciate the sheer brilliance we are witnessing in the presence of two of the world's greatest ever players. 'It's inevitable we do all this ""who's better? Blah, blah, blah"" but we should just be enjoying being around these two players and seeing it,' the QPR defender said.

Lionel Messi is La Liga's top scorer this season with 32 goals but Cristiano Ronaldo is not far behind .

"For most couples, a peck on the lips is a quick way to show affection. But for Kerrie Armitage, a kiss from husband Peter can trigger agonising hives. The mother-of-three, from Leeds, suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm. Now the 28-year-old has had to stop kissing her husband of four years, because the saliva on his lips can trigger a painful flare-up. Kerrie Armitage, from Leeds, suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She claims a kiss from her husband Peter (right) can trigger a painful flare-up, due to contact with his saliva . She said: 'Because Peter's lips are wet, the saliva can make me react. He's got to make sure his lips are dry before he gave me a kiss. 'It's not every time - I can do the same thing time and time again and not react, but then I'll do it once more and get a flare-up.' Her condition means that external exposure to water is the main problem, rather than drinking liquid. The situation has become so bad that hugging her children can trigger an episode, as their body heat makes her sweat - and she has trained herself not to cry. However, she added an allergic reaction tended to depend on the circumstances. 'For example, if Peter was to give me a kiss on a hot day when I'm flushed, I'd probably flare up, but maybe not if I was in a cool environment,' she said. 'It can be frustrating but he's really supportive. 'After years together, it's become normal. You learn how to get used it. But it can be bothersome.' Mrs Armitage now faces a daiily battle to protect her skin from agonising flare-ups - and has also been forced to give up her job as a cleaner because she cannot not touch water. Even hugging her children Katie, nine, Emily, two and four-year-old step-daughter Savannah, can become a nightmare as their body heat can trigger a reaction. 'It affects every aspect of my day to day life,' she said. 'I have to choose between doing the washing up and bathing my kids. My hands can't take them both – it's too painful.' She added: 'When I've got my children sat on me giving me a cuddle their body heat can cause me to sweat and have a reaction. Her condition has become so bad that her hugging her children can trigger an episode, as their body heat makes her sweat - and bathing them can be problematic . 'Even tears can trigger the hives. I've had to train myself not to cry. 'I've learned not to get too angry or frustrated, as this can make my body flush and cause me to sweat, which can be very painful.' Due to her condition, Mrs Armitage must ensure she bathes in under 10 minutes to try and minimise the allergic reaction. 'I've found

"Dustin Wayne South died in Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday after police were called to a field where South was seen wielding a gun . A 32-year-old man shot himself in the head during a firefight with police officers in Kentucky as horrified witnesses watched the chaotic scene unfold. Dustin Wayne South died Wednesday night at the Louisville scene, in a field behind Lassiter Middle School, a normally peaceful neighborhood in the southern part of the city. The shootout occurred after a neighbor saw South walking around the field while waving a gun in the air. Two bullets fired by police struck South, but neither was lethal, said Jo-Ann Farmer, chief deputy coroner. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Cherylyan Rayhel said she watched from a window as South waved a gun and fired into the air just behind her house about 8pm, which is when she reported the situation to the police. Officers yelled three times for him to drop the gun, but instead he raised it and pointed it at them, she said. Gunfire erupted. She did not see the man turn the gun on himself. 'I saw him fall; I screamed,' Rayhel said Thursday morning. 'I haven't slept all night.' The Louisville Metro Police Department identified the officers involved as Rondall Carpenter and Zachary Cooke. The officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. This is the second fatal shoot involving Carpenter in less than a year. Last October, he and another officer, Skylar Graudick, were involved in a shooting that killed 38-year-old William Chad Mattingly, who had allegedly fired on the officers. Louisville Metro Police officers Rondall Carpenter (left) and Zachary Cooke (right) were involved in a shootout with South, but South eventually shot himself in the head . The shooting remains under review with the commonwealth's attorney. On Wednesday night, Rayhel said she saw South fighting with a woman in the street in front of her house, just around the corner from South's home. South, weeping, hugged a young boy who was with the couple and turned to leave, Rayhel said. The boy tried to chase him, but the woman held him back. Neighbors described South as friendly and sweet. Sherri Reynolds said she often saw him in the neighborhood, playing with a little boy. But she said he'd recently seemed troubled. Last week, he went out for a drive 'to clear his emotions,' he would later tell police. Before police arrived on scene, a neighbor said that she saw South fighting with a woman in the street in front of her house . He 'was unaware of his surroundings' and careened his truck off Northwestern Parkway in Shawnee, according to court records. He slid down a hill into the Shawnee Golf Course. He tried to drive through the golf course to find an exit, but got stuck in the mud, damaging a green as he tried to drive free. South was cited for criminal mischief and scheduled to appear in court for arraignment later this month. In

'His dope man would bring it to his house and he would roll it in with some weed and smoke it with his friends. 'He got so full of himself that he sometimes stopped caring if people saw him doing it and he would be told to go outside because restaurant owners were worried about their licenses.

"An Arizona father of quadruplets whose wife died the same day his children were born says he's doing his best thanks to the help from supporters across the globe. Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona had two of the babies home with him on January 16, and the other two were cleared to leave the hospital on March 11. This after the babies were born premature and, in a tragic twist, his wife Erica, 36, passed away just one day after giving birth of hypovolemic shock which is caused by blood loss. Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Recent widower and father of quadruplets, Carlos Morales, along with his late wife Erica's mother, Sondra Bridges, say they are doing well thanks to help from generous supporters across the globe . Miracle: Even though Erica passed away, Carlos Morales considers the successful birth of his quadruplets a miracle and he is happy to have all four of them at his home . 'We’re just doing our best. I’m feeling really, really grateful for everybody that just came together and helped us,' Carlos told Today,referring to the nearly $350,000 raised on a GoFundMe page set up for the family. Erica's mother, Sondra Bridges, now lives with Morales to help take care of the babies: Tracy, Paisley, Erica and Carlos, Jr. Bridges also gave thanks for the tremendous outpouring of support that the family received. 'It’s funny how things turn out. Bittersweet, but at the same time, thanks to God, and the outpouring support of the public, it’s been phenomenal,' she said. 'And I’d like to say thank you to each and every one of you. All the support we’ve gotten from you, we appreciate it.' Morales is sill mourning the loss of Erica, however, with whom he dreamed of having a big family. The pair had gone through IVF fertility treatment in a desperate attempt to conceive to complete their family. But the last time Mr Morales saw his wife was when she kissed her on the head and said he loved her before going into labor at Banner Good Samaritan Hospital. Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, finally has his newborn quadruplets home with him . Tragic: Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, held the babies - three girls and one boy - after his wife Erica, 36, passed away on January 16. Their mother would never get to meet them .

He then added; 'I already know their quirky little habits or the next time they're going to cry. They're starting to form their own personalities.' And while he says dealing with four is a lot more difficult than dealing with two, he does have help thanks to his wife's mother-in-law, who moved down to help with the children. The children arrived one month before her due date.

"(CNN)There is plenty of noise surrounding the nuclear deal that is being negotiated with Iran. But for all the heat generated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress and an ill-conceived, panicky letter to Iran's leadership organized by Sen.Tom Cotton -- the latest debate is creating little light. Indeed, it may actually be obscuring the fundamental issue of Iran's own foreign policies -- and whether Tehran's destabilizing activities abroad should preclude a deal at all. Unfortunately, few in Congress have taken the time to consider the matter in a thoughtful, coherent manner. There are, of course, certain realities that should not be in dispute: Yes, Iran is a regional adversary to a number of its Gulf neighbors and Israel. And it does aim to provoke Sunni-led Gulf states and generally to sow seeds of sectarian Islam abroad. In addition, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp's Quds force is alleged to have provided training and weapons to a range of militants -- Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, Houthi rebels in Yemen, disenfranchised Shia Muslims in Bahrain, and even to militant groups in West Africa. Most recently, Iran has been directing military operations by U.S.-equipped Iraqi forces against ISIS militants in Iraq, forces that have been aided by U.S. airstrikes. Netanyahu grasped the irony, starkly warning ""when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy."" (Although Sen. Marco Rubio appears to be confused, insisting at a March 11 hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Iran must be unhappy with U.S. airstrikes against ISIS). Yet the question that Netanyahu did not answer, and which Sen. Cotton and his 46 colleagues have not even asked, is what exactly should be done about Iran's activities abroad? Many in Congress fail to grasp that Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and his colleagues in Iran's Cabinet, with their U.S.-PhDs and understanding of plural democracies, are not cut from the same cloth as the hardliners in charge of Iran's Quds force (its commander, Qasem Suleimani turns up in Lebanon and Iraq despite a travel and asset ban). And yes, it was the Quds force that provided the explosives and operatives that led to significant U.S. casualties in the early years of the 2003 Iraq war. To answer the question of what to do about Iran's activities, it is important to understand that the nuclear agreement, while it has little to do with Iran's arms transfers or extracurricular activities in the region, can lay the groundwork for a far more serious engagement about Iran's role in the region -- and in a manner that addresses head-on the concerns of its Sunni neighbors, many of whom are eager to resume longstanding trading relationships with Iran. The reality is that Iran's reemergence into the international community in a postnuclear deal environment would allow the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to assert its interests in the region, and to lay out expectations of Iran as a constructive partner. It might even lead to quiet, back-channel diplomacy about

"Sometimes walking in a straight line without tripping over with just two feet is enough of a challenge. So imagine the kind of coordination it would require if you had eight legs. Now scientists have unraveled how octopuses manage to keep track of all of their flailing limbs as they crawl over objects. The video above, recorded by researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, shows how that despite its body orientation (green arrow) the octopus can crawl in any direction (blue arrow) thanks to its flexible arms . Using high speed videos of octopuses as they negotiated obstacles, biologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel studied the cephlopods movement. They found that the orientation of the creature's body and the crawling direction are controlled independently in the brain. Male octopuses have a long, detachable penis in order to mate with females that are five times bigger than itself. When a female swims by, the male Argonaut sends his penis off to swim to the female and mate with her. In fact, the penis is a ball of sperm in a tentacle called a hectocotylus and females can be fertilised by more than one, by storing them in the mantle cavity. The male dies soon after his unique ordeal, whereas the female can mate several times and even store multiple hectocotyli in a special cavity until they’re needed. In the past, scientists that caught female specimens confused the attached penises for parasitic worms. The male mollusc won almost a third of votes in a survey set up by the Society of Biology to identify the strangest animal sex. The thrust comes from arms that push by elongation rather than arms that pull. This combined with they symmetrical arrangement of the arms around the body helps to give the marine creatures their extraordinary maneuverability. It is the first time scientists have been able to fully understand how octopuses are able to control their movements without a rigid skeleton. The findings may help scientists develop new ways for soft robots to move around and can also shed some light on how octopuses evolved in the first place. Professor Binyamin Hochner, who led the research, said: 'Octopuses use unique locomotion strategies that are different from those found in other animals. 'This is most likely due to their soft molluscan body that led to the evolution of 'strange' morphology, enabling efficient locomotion control without a rigid skeleton.' Octopuses are thought to have evolved from clam-like creatures in the mollusc family. But as they lost their hard protective shell, they seem to have evolved to move far faster than other members of the mollusc family like slugs or snails. The octopus was found to move by pushing with its legs rather than pulling while it could move in any direction regardless of the position of its body - something that humans find extremely difficult to do without falling over . Dr Guy Levy, a neurobiologist who also took part in the research at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said: 'During evolution, octopuses lost their heavy

"A Mexican cartel boss known as 'The Liquidator' has been detained by the country's authorities, who claim he is 'linked to the bloodiest events ever recorded in Juarez City'. Mexican federal authorities arrested Juarez Cartel boss Jesus Salas Aguayo on Friday, bringing an end to the career of a criminal who was famed for dispatching his enemies with the use of dynamite. Earning the nickname 'The Liquidator' for the brutal and ruthless methods that earned him a place on the DEA's Most Wanted list, Aguayo is charged with multiple felonies including the distribution of narcotics, homicide and arms trafficking. Scroll down for video . Fearsome: Jesus Salas Aguayo, a former gun for hire and Jarez Cartel boss known for his brutal murders of rivals, was arrested on Friday by Mexican police . Mexican authorities link over twenty deaths directly to The Liquidator, including the 2009 murder of a state witness in El Paso, a 2010 car-bombing which claimed the lives of two federal police officers and a 2012 massacre of fifteen people in a Juarez City bar. In 2008 the Sinaloa Cartel declared war on the Juarez Cartel as it sought to take control of Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million people that sits on the border with El Paso, Texas. That year alone saw 1,600 homicides in the city, and Ciudad Juarez City achieved the title of the most dangerous city in the world for three consecutive years. Jesus Aguayo, also known as 'El Chuyín', led the assault on the invading Sinaloa forces, causing the bloodshed of narcos, Mexican authorities and civilians alike. A respected 'sicario' or hired gun, The Liquidator was known to have spoken of his ambitions to one day run his own drug cartel. In 2008 he was hired by the Juarez Cartel bosses, who sent him to Ciudad Juarez to take over command of La Línea (The Line), the cartel's street-level army of assassins, who were notorious for mutilating the bodies of their enemies and civilians alike. The Jaurez Cartel was formerly one of the most feared in Mexico, but is now all but extinct following a war with the Sinoala cartel, and high profile arrests (pictured, boss Ricardo Gracia Urquiza is arrested in 2005) The Juarez Cartel eventually lost the conflict after three murderous years, and today its agents are spread widely across Chihuahua state. Today Juarez City, once a lively and popular border town, shows the scars of a drug war that cost nearly ten thousand lives over the space of four years. Entire districts of the city are deserted, rare are the buildings not marked with bullet holes and there are sections where even the police dare not enter given the narcos' stranglehold on the territory. The arrest of The Liquidator occurred on Friday in his hometown of Villa Ahumada, some 80 miles south of Ciudad Juarez. A gunfight occurred as the task-force moved in to detain Aguayo and his two bodyguards, one of whom was killed in an exchange of fire. Following The Liquidator's detention, federal agents seized a number of items

"A Mexican Mafia hit man convicted of beating and strangling a San Antonio woman because she didn't pay the gang's 10 per cent tax on her illegal drug sales was executed Wednesday evening. The injection of Manuel Vasquez with a lethal dose of pentobarbital leaves Texas with enough of the powerful sedative to carry out only one more execution. Vasquez was the fourth Texas inmate put to death this year, and at least six are scheduled for execution in the coming weeks. Texas prison officials, like those in other death penalty states, have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use. Scroll down for video . Put to death: Gang enforcer Manuel Vasquez, 46, was executed Wednesday for the ordered murder of a San Antonio woman who ignored a 10 per cent street tax on drugs known as a 'dime' Vasquez, 46, was pronounced dead at 6.32pm CDT, 17 minutes after the drug began being administered. Vasquez, in a final statement, told his family and friends he loved them and thanked 'the Lord for his kind mercy, faithfulness and unconditional love.' 'In Jesus' name I pray,' he said, then told the warden: 'I'm ready.' He took three deep breaths, then began snoring loudly. The snores became progressively quiet, and all movement stopped within less than a minute. The sister of his victim was among witnesses watching through a window. He never looked at her. His own sister and a female friend cried as they watched in an adjacent room. Vasquez's lawyers filed no late appeals to delay his execution for the 1998 slaying of 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra. Evidence at Vasquez's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra for ignoring the Mexican Mafia's 10 per cent street tax on drugs — known as a 'dime.' 'I'm sure she was told if you're selling, you've got to pay the tax,' said Mary Green, an assistant Bexar County district attorney who prosecuted Vasquez. 'I guess she didn't take it seriously.' After a night of drinking and drugs at a run-down San Antonio motel, Vasquez and two companions put on bandannas on their facesbarged into the nearby room of Ybarra and her boyfriend, Moses Bazan, early on March 19, 1998, according to evidence presented at his trial. Bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw Ybarra being beaten, heard Vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw Vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle Ybarra. The attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry, stuffed them into a pillowcase and fled. When Bazan regained consciousness, he stumbled to the motel office to summon police. He was able to identify at least one of the attackers, leading to the arrest of all three. One of them, Johnny Joe Cruz, took a plea deal that carried a seven-year sentence and testified against Vasquez. The third man charged, Oligario Lujan, is serving a 35-year prison term. Court records show the three were carrying out orders from

"A high school journalism teacher has shot dead her former police officer ex-husband after an argument during a messy split, police have said. Cara Ryan, 45, killed John Joseph Rush, also 45, at her home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida around 11pm on Saturday. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office initially said the shooting occurred during a domestic dispute and they did not bring any charges, but on Friday, they said that Ryan had been arrested. The sheriff said he would share more details about the incident at a press conference on Friday afternoon. Gunned down: Cara Ryan, left, shot dead her ex-husband John Joseph Rush, right, on Saturday after an argument at their home. She has now been charged with his murder following an investigation . Authorities previously said they had been arguing before the shooting, Fox 13 reported. The couple, who have a grown daughter together, had divorced in 2003 but then they later moved back in with each other, Fox reported. But Rush's family told the channel that the relationship had soured again in recent months and he had moved out of the home in February. It was not clear why he returned at the weekend. Rush, known to friends as 'JJ', had retired from the St Petersburg Police, where he had worked in the forensic unit, with an injury following an on-duty car crash in 2005. Afterwards he went to work for the county medical examiner's officer, family members said. Sergeant Joe Pratt, who had worked with Rush, said he was stunned that his friend, who had survived working a dangerous job, was ultimately killed at home, WTSP reported. 'Something like this, you just never anticipate, so it's really a shock when something like this happens to someone you know and care about and has been a part of your life the past 25 years,' he said. Split: Ryan, a high school teacher, and Rush, a former cop, had divorced in 2003 but had rekindled and had moved back in together. But their relationship soured again and he moved out last month . Scene: The shooting unfolded following an argument at Ryan's home, pictured, on Saturday night . Shock: Police can be seen responding to the scene in Indian Rocks Beach on Saturday night . Ryan, who owns the home where he was shot, is a media production teacher at Clearwater High School. According to her LinkedIn page, she has been with the school district for two decades. Her Facebook profile features a picture of her and her ex-husband sitting close together and looking into each other's eyes. Another image shows them walking on a beach with their daughter. On a gofundme page set up in her father's memory, their daughter Meghan paid tribute to his service. The page has raised more than $5,000 of a $10,000 goal. 'The unexpected death of John has been an emotional roller coaster for our family,' she wrote. 'We are all proud of John’s service and we always greatly appreciate the day to day sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make

"They were young men from stable families who believed they were stuck in dead end jobs and looked on with jealousy at the flashy lifestyles of others who had girls, money and fast cars at their fingertips. What Andrew Chan, then aged 21, and Myuran Sukumaran, 24, came to have in common was the belief that smuggling drugs would provide them with a short cut to the life of ease and glamour and - their biggest mistake - that they could get away with it. Thirteen years since their fateful first meeting, after all their legal appeals and pleas for clemency have been rejected, the ringleaders of the infamous Bali Nine, who were caught trying to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin out of Indonesia, are now dead. Scroll down for video . Andrew Chan, pictured aged 21, and Myuran Sukumaran, 24, pictured during their first trial in October of 2005, were both attracted to drug smuggling by the promised riches, after being disillusioned by their jobs . Thirteen years since their fateful first meeting, after all their legal appeals and pleas for clemency have been rejected, the ringleaders of the infamous Bali Nine and their tragic tale will shortly come to an end . Dubbed the masterminds behind the $4 million drug plot from the very beginning, the death penalty has never left the table for Chan and Sukumaran since they were first convicted in 2005 following a tip off from Australian federal police to Indonesian officials. But a glance at their working-class backgrounds would never have led anyone to predict their dismal fate. Chan, the youngest of four children and the son of Chinese immigrants, once described himself as the black sheep of his family. He worked as a supervisor for the catering company Eurest, where he first met Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens and Matthew Norman, who he would later recruit into the drug smuggling roles that landed them in various Indonesian prisons. Sukumaran, a university drop-out and the eldest of three, still lived with his parents while working in a mail room. The Bali Nine trials began in October 2005 at Denpasar district court: Top row (from L-R) Myuran Sukumaran, Andrew Chan and Martin Eric Stephens, 2nd row (from L-R) Chen Si Yi, Tach Duc Thanh Nguyen and Matthew Norman, and 3rd row (from L-R) Scott Rush, Michael Czugaj and Renae Lawrence . Both men, who first met at a party in 2002 despite attending the same Sydney high school, had one thing in common; they were disillusioned by their jobs and had been won over by the riches and lifestyle that selling drugs promised. 'I don't think I was really going anywhere in life. I don't think, you know, I was achieving too much, even though I had a stable job and all… I was a drug user,' Chan told Dateline in a 2010 interview in which Sukumaran also admitted: 'I didn't see myself working in the mail room for the next 50 years of my life'.

"Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates . Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season . 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations. 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres . Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time . But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again . 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.

"Chelsea Manning, the US soldier serving a 35-year prison sentence for a massive document leak, should be addressed in gender-neutral or feminine terms in court documents. Judges made the ruling as Manning continues her transition into a woman. Chelsea, 27, formerly known as Bradley Manning, is incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. She had already secured permission last year to be known under the name 'Chelsea' instead of 'Bradley'. Chelsea Manning, pictured here (center) in 2013 before she began her transition, was known as Bradley when she went on trial for the massive document leak to the WikiLeaks website . Chelsea, 27, pictured here in a wig and lipstick in an undated photograph, is allowed to wear women's underwear, undergo psychotherapy, and has had hormone therapy for gender reassignment approved . The former intelligence analyst had also been allowed to wear women's underwear following a decision last year, and to undergo psychotherapy. The latest move comes a month after the U.S. Army approved hormone therapy for Manning's gender reassignment - a first for the American military. 'All future formal papers filed before this court and all future orders and decisions issued by this court shall either be neutral, e.g. Private First Class Manning or appellant, or employ a feminine pronoun' said a court order on Wednesday. Manning, pictured on stickers worn by a demonstrator, has now won the right to be addressed in gender-neutral or feminine terms in court . However 'in respect to historic fact,' the court will retain masculine wordage used in previous decisions, including Manning's conviction. The news has been welcomed by Manning's defense team. 'The court rightly recognized that dignifying Chelsea's womanhood is not the trivial matter that the government attempted to frame it as,' said Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which was involved in Manning's defense. Manning was convicted in August 2013 of espionage and other offenses after admitting to handing over more than 700,000 classified documents to the WikiLeaks website while stationed in Iraq.

"Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps is once again having the alleged details of his sexual escapades shared by a former paramour. This time around it is Kim Petro, a 36-year-old plus-sized dominatrix from New York City who is detailing her wild night spent with the swimmer, one that she claims involved her urinating on him and Phelps wearing women's underwear. This all comes just a few months after another woman, Taylor Lianne Chandler, came forward to detail her sexually-fueled relationship with the highly-decorated athlete. It also comes a month after Phelps popped the question to girlfriend Nicole Johnson, a former Miss California. Plus-sized dominatrix Kim Petro (above) has given an interview claiming she had a wild night with swimmer Michael Phelps who paid her a $900 'donation' 'When he said drink some water before I get to the hotel, I knew what I was in for,' said Petro of Phelps (above) She alleges that she urinated on Phelps while he lay on his bed in the London hotel in women's underwear in February 2013. Afterwards, she claims she showed him her breasts while he pleasured himself and two smoked marijuana together . In an interview with The National Enquirer, Petro says that Phelps contacted her in February 2013 and paid a $900 'donation' for her to come to his hotel room at The London in Manhattan. This after an online posting that said; 'All-natural, super busty fetish provider with all the right curves in all the right places. 'Time with me is time well spent. Nothing shocks me. Don't be shy.' Phelps, Petro claims, called her on his cell phone, saying his name was Fabian Marasciullo, a Miami music producer who is close to Phelps' good friend, rapper Lil' Wayne. 'When he said drink some water before I get to the hotel, I knew what I was in for,' said Petro. 'I was going to go to the bathroom anyway - I figured I might as well get paid for it!' When she got to the hotel she claims Phelps removed his shirt and then shorts to reveal that he was wearing 'skimpy women's underwear.' They then smoked a little weed according to Petro and got down to business. 'I got above him [on the bed] to [urinate on him],' said Petro. 'After I was done, he asked if it was okay to [pleasure himself]. Of course, I’m going to bend the rules a little for a famous Olympian, so he pulled down his panties.' That is when she claims she noticed he had a string tied around his genitals. 'I grabbed [the string] and pulled, and I also took out my breasts because he wanted to see them,' she said. This comes just months after another of Phelps' former paramours, Taylor Lianne Chandler (above), shared details of their alleged sexual romps. 'The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman,' said Chandler of Phelps . Phelps proposed to girlfriend Nicole Johnson, a former Miss California, last month

"A mother left with mounds of overhanging skin after losing 10 stone through a gastric bypass is begging to have it removed on the NHS so she can find love. Sarah Lord, of Wakefield, was a size 12 before she fell pregnant with her daughter Bryony, now 12. But after her relationship with Bryony's father came to an end four months into her pregnancy, she became depressed and gave into cravings and comfort eating. The 30-year-old was referred for bariatric surgery by her doctor, and went on to lose 10 stone, swapping a diet of fry ups and pies for stir fries and fruit. Sarah Lord, 30, lost 10st after a gastric bypass operation in September 2010, after ballooning to a size 24. She is pictured before (left) and after her weight loss (right), now back to a size 12 . Although she says she feels healthier after losing weight, Miss Lord has been left with a huge flap of excess skin which has ruined her confidence and left her too insecure to attract men or wear a bikini . Miss Lord had become depressed after a break-up four months into her pregnancy, and gained weight after turning to comfort eating (left). After her gastric bypass (right) she changed her diet and began exercising . The procedure has left her with a pouch of saggy skin around her waist, which she says has ruined her confidence and left her unable to attract men. Miss Lord, who works as a team leader for the Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'I've gained a lot of positives, but the saggy skin is holding me back from my happy ending. 'I'd like to have someone to share my life with - and no man can fancy me with all this excess skin. I need to get it removed. 'I've asked the NHS for another funded op - now I just need to hear back from my doctor to see if I qualify.' At 16 weeks into her pregnancy, Miss Lord's relationship with her daughter's father broke down. She said: 'The pregnancy was making me feeling anxious enough, and the breakup was very upsetting. I fell into a dip of depression, which I coped with through eating.' By the time Bryony was attending her first days at school, Miss Lord had ballooned six dress sizes and gained ten stone, leaving her at 22 stone and size 24. BEFORE . Breakfast: Bacon, egg and sausage sandwich . Lunch: Pie and chips . Dinner: Beef stew with Yorkshire pudding . Snacks: Crisps and chocolate . AFTER . Breakfast: Cereal .

"While Hillary Clinton was using a private email address hosted on her own home-based computer server to conduct State Department business, her agency forced out an ambassador who was doing the same thing overseas. Retired Air Force General Scott Gration was US ambassador to Kenya for 13 months between 2011 and 2012, departing after a scathing performance report blasted his leadership style and determined that he created security risks by running his own one-person IT department. The report determined that Gration 'assumed charge of the mission’s information management operations,' in Nairobi, and 'ordered a commercial Internet connection installed in his embassy office bathroom so he could work there on a laptop not connected to the Department email system.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND GRATION'S PERFORMANCE REPORT . OUSTED: Scott Gration (left) was special envoy to Sudan before he spent 13 months as ambassador to Kenya; he was forced out after an inspector general report found problems with his performance – including the use of unauthorized commercial email services to conduct government business outside of secure channels . EMAIL-GATE: Hillary Clinton never used an official government email address as secretary of state, relying on a private server at the same time her agency was forcing Gration out for, among other things, doing the same . He also tried to legitimize his actions by writing new policy and distributing it to the embassy staff, saying the use of 'commercial email' for government business was acceptable. Gration, the State Department's Office of Inspector General wrote, 'continued to use commercial email for official government business' even when investigators were digging into his conduct. The report noted that he seldom logged on to his official State Department email account; The New York Times later reported that he 'preferred to use Gmail for official business.' Clinton, the odds-on favorite to be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 2016, came under fire this week for using a private email account – not a State Department 'state.gov' address – to conduct government business. Her aides, and Obama administration colleagues – including White House personnel – reached her at 'hdr22@clintonemail.com' for the four years she was America's top diplomat. The revelation has led to accusations that the former secretary failed to turn over all her communications for archiving, as the Federal Records Act requires. Additional questions have swirled around potential national security risks posed by having sensitive material flowing through unsecure channels. Scott Gration lasted just 13 months as an ambassador before his management style and data security breaches ended his State Dept. career . Clinton helmed the State Department through the entirety of Gration's tenure as ambassador. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment about parallels between her case and Gration's. But the 2012 IG report spelled out a policy that it appears Clinton herself failed to follow. 'It is the department's general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,' the report read. 'The use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for

"England's premier bowler Jimmy Anderson suffered a frustrating day in his bid to become his country's all-time leading wicket taker in his 100th Test appearance in Antigua. But pace attack colleague Chris Jordan believes the Anderson family celebration party is 'just around the corner' as West Indies fell to 155 for four in response to England's first-innings total of 399. Anderson, watched by his parents, wife, two daughters and agent and needing four wickets to overtake the great Sir Ian Botham's haul of 383, claimed only one early victim in West Indies opener Devon Smith in his 13 overs, which went for 24 runs and eight maidens. Jimmy Anderson moved to within two wickets of Sir Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets . Anderson could only take the one wicket on day two of the first Test in Antigua . But even the England back-room staff were surprised that Anderson bowled just four overs in the last session of play with team-mates Jordan, Stuart Broad and James Tredwell sharing the other wickets to fall. It could have been better but a Ben Stokes wicket was ruled a no ball. Jordan took a stunning slip catch off Tredwell to dismiss West Indies vice-captain Kraigg Brathwaite, who claimed after play that he thought Anderson ' looked tired'. But Jordan said: 'Jimmy got us off and running with the first wicket and the rest of us tried to back that up, which I thought we did pretty well. If he keeps doing that and bowling the way he does those wickets are just around the corner. Chris Jordan jumps for joy after taking the wicket of Darren Bravo on the second afternoon . Jordan appeals for an lbw against West Indian batsman Kraigg Brathwaite, but it was unsuccessful . 'The stat is obviously there but I don't think Jimmy or any of us are going about our cricket or thinking about things differently. 'We're just trying to group balls as a bowling unit and create pressure. 'As a group we try and win every session, so we'll come back as hard as we can to break this partnership then make inroads into the tail.' Ironically, No 11 Anderson and Jordan were the pick of the lower-order England batsman in a last-wicket partnership of 38 as the West Indies bowling attack, inspired by a talk from bowling coach Sir Curtly Ambrose, captured the last five wickets for 58. West Indies opener Brathwaite did a good job of seeing off Anderson in a challenging first spell and though he eventually fell for 39, he enjoyed the test. Jordan later took a stunning catch at first slip off Tredwell's bowling to dismiss Brathwaite . 'Obviously when Anderson started with the new ball it was moving a lot, so facing him then was a little more challenging. 'But obviously he bowled a couple of overs before lunch as well so I don't know if maybe he was a little bit tired. 'It was a good challenge facing him when the ball is swinging both ways. The key is

"A Tumblr user has claimed that every female character used in a Disney or Pixar film in the last decade has the same face. The post by Every-Flavored-Bean on the Something Classy blog was uploaded after they saw stills from the new film Inside Out - and noticed the similarities between the women's faces.

They suggested that every female character from the last decade is a 'descendant of some primordial creature' with 'huge round cheeks and a disturbingly small nose'.

The user wrote: 'So when I saw this picture for the new Pixar movie Inside Out, at first I thought the characters were three women and two aliens, but after seeing the trailer I realized the purple and red things were supposed to be dudes. 'After tracing their faces, I figured out why I was so weirded out: The two male characters have extremely distinctive face shapes, while the three female characters basically have the exact same shape; round with a small nose.

The green drawings (male) and the red lines (female) show the differences between the two . According to a Tumblr user, he said: 'Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, because they have to go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty and they’re very sensitive to — you can get them off a model very quickly. 'So, having a film with two hero female characters was really tough, and having them both in the scene and look very different if they’re echoing the same expression; that Elsa looking angry looks different from Anna being angry.' A Disney spokeswoman reacted to the controversy by saying: 'Animation is an intricate and complex art form. 'These comments were recklessly taken out of context. As part of a roundtable discussion the binaries was describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animations females versus males or other characters.'

"The starting pistol has been fired on the campaign to pack bars and clubs in Magaluf with thrill-seeking British teenagers this summer. After new lows were plumbed by venues in the Majorcan resort last year, clubs are gearing up for another summer of binge drinking, sun, sea and sex. Clubs linked to the one where a girl performed sex acts on 24 men last July are advertising positions for 'podium dancers' over the coming summer. Meanwhile Carnage Magaluf, the company who organised the now infamous event, is already signing youngsters up for 'unlimited free shots' on £30 'booze cruises'. Scroll down for video . Bars and clubs in Magaluf are playing on the resort's reputation in ad campaigns targeting British teens . Nightclub promoters in Magaluf have begun tweeting messages to bring in youngsters this summer . The Carnage Magalluf firm is even trading off the back of events last summer, tweeting: 'Who's ready for the world famous bar crawl starting in April?' The firm's website is now advertising VIP pool parties, jungle sessions and bar crawls alongside images of a barman pouring spirits into a young woman's mouth in a so-called 'dentist's chair' position. It comes as police on the Spanish island are given new powers to seize drinks from tourists on the street between 10pm and 8am. There will also be tougher restrictions bar crawls and fines for 'balconing' - a craze for jumping off hotel balconies which has led to several deaths. Authorities are also in talks to fly in British police to patrol the streets over the height of the summer season. But those organising the bar crawls have shrugged off the new controls, which they fear could deter youngsters wanting to let loose. Organisers of the Carnage Magaluf bar-crawl, at which a British teenager was encourage to perform sex acts on 24 men last year, have played on their notoriety while others insist new rules will not affect street drinking . Adverts are being sent out adversing cocktails for just one euro (80 pence) in many bars in the resort . The Magaluf 2015 Twitter feed posted a message saying: 'Absolute nonsense about drinking laws in #Magaluf. Clubs still open till 6am, bars open until 4am, some bars open at 6am!'

Bars are already advertising their one euro drinks deals - with cocktails called 'f***** hammered', 'scruffy cow' and 'f***** up', described as a 'nine spirit mix', all available for less than a pound.

"Waiting times to be seen in A&E have soared to their worst level in more than 10 years, official figures revealed this morning. In the first three months of the year, 434,775 people waited longer than four hours in hospital emergency wards - some 4,830 patients every day. Over the past year, more than 1.4 million people were forced to wait longer than the target time – compared to just 353,000 in 2009/10 – the worst on record since 2004. Over the past year, more than 1.4 million people were forced to wait longer than the target time – compared to just 353,000 in 2009/10 . The figures also show that 113,648 waited longer than four-hours on trolleys in A&E, and 983 over 12 hours. It is now 89 weeks since hospital A&Es met their waiting targets. NHS England figures show that 92 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in the week ending March 29. This was down on the previous week when 93.2 per cent were seen within the time limit. It comes after the Department of Health last week confirmed the NHS has failed to meet its target every week of the winter, meaning the average for the whole year has not been met. Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said the Government was the blame for the NHS's failure. David Cameron has overseen a record hump in waiting times to be seen in A&E, official figures revealed this morning . Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at an election campaign event in Bristol this morning, has promised to bin the Government's NHS reforms . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised to give NHS chiefs 'whatever they need' after the election. Mr Hunt claimed a Conservative government would find whatever money the health service said it needed to cope with the growing pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries. The NHS's chief executive Simon Stevens has said the health service needs an extra £8billion a year by 2020 just to keep standards as they are. Mr Hunt today vowed to find the cash – but went further by claiming that the Government would find even more cash if they health service needed it. He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'We will back the NHS's own plan in full, so we agree with the £30 billion gap, and we agree with the NHS when they say that if they can make £22 billion of efficiency savings the NHS would need £8 billion. 'But they also said in that plan very clearly that they might need less than £8 billion if they can make more efficiency savings, or they might need more than £8 billion if they can't make those efficiency savings.' He added: 'We will give whatever they need, it might be more than £8 billion, it might be less, but the point is you can only have this discussion if you have a strong and growing economy.' 'Over the course of this parliament, on the back of a strong and growing economy, we have actually increased

"The head of the US army has admitted that he is ‘very concerned’ about cuts to Britain’s defence spending. General Raymond Odierno warned that the cuts could diminish Britain’s ability to fight future campaigns. He also called on the Government to maintain defence spending at the Nato target of two per cent of national income. Scroll down for video . Head of the US Army General Raymond Odierno, who has warned that cuts to Britain's defence spending could diminish their ability to fight future campaigns . General Odierno, the US army chief of staff, suggested defence cuts had already damaged America’s confidence in their military ally. I would be lying to you if I did not say that I am very concerned about the GDP investment in the UK,’ he told The Daily Telegraph. ‘We have a bilateral agreement between our two countries to work together. It is about having a partner that has very close values and the same goals as we do. ‘What has changed, though, is the level of capability. In the past we would have a British Army division working alongside an American army division. Now it might be a British brigade inside an American division.’ His warning came after the former head of the Army said yesterday that fresh cuts to Britain’s Armed Forces would be ‘unwise’ with the West facing twin dangers of a new Cold War with Russia and the rise of Islamist extremism. Sir Peter Wall (left) and former Defence Secretary (right) are among those to have spoken out against the Chancellor's plan to reduce military spending to below the NATO benchmark of 2 per cent of GDP . In his first interview since retiring last September, General Sir Peter Wall admitted that he doubted UK politicians had the will to ‘tackle the really wicked issues’ facing the world. And the ex-Chief of the General Staff urged all the major political parties to promise to protect defence spending at 2 per cent of national income after the general election. He said a fall in funding would lead to cuts in budgets for training, equipment and even military missions – further undermining the UK’s global standing. The Prime Minister has faced criticism over the cuts which, say experts, would 'comfort enemies' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Sir Peter urged: 'We military folk would like to see manifesto commitments to levels of defence expenditure and it's of concern to us that all parties would probably be content to have this conversation not happening at the moment. 'Implicit in what the current government was saying around the time of the Nato summit in Wales last year where we were suggesting that it was everybody's responsibility around Europe to meet the 2% of GDP for defence expenditure, implicit in that is the fact that that's what we ought to be doing ourselves.' His views were echoed by former Defence Secretary Liam Fox who suggested foreign aid be redirected in order to increase funds. 'To say that we were willing to guarantee a proportion of

"(CNN)One hundred and forty-seven victims. Many more families affected. Even more broken hopes and dreams. As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, killing nearly 70 people.

"Scottish voters would rather have a referendum on the EU than another independence vote, a new survey has revealed. The idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters. It comes after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections. Scroll down for video . Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was campaigning in Aberdeen today ahead of a second TV debate tonight . When questioned on the issue in last night's Scottish leaders TV debate, Ms Sturgeon insisted an SNP victory in the General Election would not trigger another referendum. But she added it was 'another matter' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 Holyrood elections would bring about a second vote on independence. Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately. In last night's TV showdown with the Scottish leaders of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence vote before 2020 . Ms Sturgeon has vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe . The most popular policy was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, which was given a score of 8.2. Giving the Scottish Parliament power over all welfare benefits was eighth most popular, with a score of 7.1, while transferring full responsibility for income tax to Holyrood came 10th on the list at 6.8. Holding another independence referendum by 2020 was given a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies. He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.' Scotland's political leaders, from left to right, Tory Ruth Davidson, Labour's Jim Murphy, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie faced off in a live TV election debate last night . Overall, Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit – but also favour the Government's

Scroll down for video . The 14-year-old student who severely beat a Missouri sixth-grader with Asperger's syndrome will be taken into custody by the state's youth services division for treatment. The teen, whose name has not been released, admitted to striking Blake Kitchen (above), 12, in their school's lunchroom last month . In the February 19 attack, Blake (above) was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School . 'They can pretty much tailor a program to each individual kid based on their needs,' said Janet Rogers, interim juvenile officer for Clay County. 'Their goal is to get these kids turned around so they can make better choices before they hit adulthood.' In the February 19 attack, Blake was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School. Blake has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. His parents said that turned troublesome when last month, a boy moved Blake's belongings from his seat. When Blake asked the boy to move, another boy began hitting him. 'Then I blacked out,' Blake told WDAF. 'My ear hurts, my jaw hurts, my back hurts and that's all.' Blake (pictured left and right) has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. The altercation occurred after some other schoolchildren moved his stuff in the cafeteria one morning . Blake's mother, Destiny, said the boy continued to beat her son even after he had blacked out, but she said luckily he does not remember the attack, according to Fox2Now. 'He doesn't remember any of that. I guess that was a blessing. He was unconscious and doesn't remember being violently attacked. It's sad he didn't stop,' she said. 'Anytime they moved him he would vomit. Dry heaving constantly, just dry heaving. Him crying and saying it was so painful and he was afraid he was going to die. He was like 'I don't want to die'.' Blake spent five days at Children's Mercy Hospital and was later released. His injuries have left him facing a second surgery

The 85-year-old was in fabulous form as he confirmed that not even a dislocated shoulder suffered during a fall at his home in January will keep him away from hitting the ceremonial tee shot at the Masters, alongside Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, next month. ‘I’m going to hit a few golf balls next week and I have every intention of being at Augusta to play the first shot at the Masters, I can assure you of that,’ he said. ‘I’m looking forward to getting back in the gym. I still try to exercise three times a week because I think it’s important. Heck, I’m going to get old one of these days and I want to be in shape when it happens.’ Cue more laughter. On the subject of McIlroy, Palmer said: ’I’m so pleased he’s come this year, we’re very happy to have him. And I’ve got a good feeling about Rory this week. I’ve a feeling he’s going to snap to it and play very well.’ McIlroy has had a disappointing time of it so far in Florida.

"Two British men have been fined $3,000 for threatening behaviour on board a Thomson Airways flight. One allegedly threw peanuts and a pound coin at cabin crew, with the other was accused of hitting himself on the head with clenched fists during the disturbance, which forced the flight from London to Mexico to divert to Bermuda. Jamie Richardson, 38, from Lancing, West Sussex and Daniel Taylor, 37, from Worthing, West Sussex, both pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour in a Bermuda court. Scroll down for video . Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda . The two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them. The Royal Gazette reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning. The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head. Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a plane . Richardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner. Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight. The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers. In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally. Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair. 'In these times it could be a lot harsher – you can’t mess around in the air these days,' he said. A statement on the Bermuda Police website read: 'Around 12:55pm on Sunday, April 12 police officers responded to a report of two disruptive passengers on a diverted Thomson Airways flight landing at LF Wade International Airport. 'The two male passengers involved were subsequently escorted off the plane and taken into police custody. 'The Thomson aircraft was apparently en route from London, U.K. to Cancun, Mexico.'

"The US military’s Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (Darpa) says they may have a method to stop all infectious diseases - including Ebola. By encoding RNA and DNA in a specific way, Darpa say a person could simply go into a shop and get an injection to protect them against a disease. This could be used to prevent mass outbreaks in affected areas. US military's Darpa has developed a method to stop infectious diseases. It involves encoding RNA and DNA with instructions for antibodies. A person could then be injected with the antibodies at a pharmacy (stock image shown). This enables a person's cells to fight an infectious disease . ‘We’re going to take the genetic code and put it into a format where you go to your drug store or doctor and get a shot in the arm,’ said Darpa programme manager Dan Wattendorf at an event in San Francisco, reported Fusion. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids. RNA is formed from strings of nucleic acids, the same building blocks that create DNA. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell and RNA is what helps translate it. Some life, like viruses, only use RNA and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on Earth used this molecule. Proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids. These carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick. Lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles. They form the membrane 'walls' of every living cell and give them structure. They are also essential for sending signals out of the cell. ‘There’s a low-cost of goods, no cold chain, and we would produce the correct antibody in [any] individual directly.’ The method works by creating powerful antibodies from survivors of an infectious disease. ‘Instructions’ on how to make these antibodies are then encoded into RNA and DNA, which are injected into people who might come into contact with the disease. Their cells then start creating the antibodies, protecting them from catching the potentially dangerous disease. Darpa is currently funding the project through Emory University in Atlanta. Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu or malaria. Antibodies are typically grown in large vats of mammal cells or in some cases, tobacco plants, such as US pharmaceutical company Mapp Biopharmaceutical's experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp. Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu, malaria and Ebola.

The 27-year-old's mother Vera Kowalski told The Sunday Mail that her son had penned his last words: 'I have been bitten by a snake' on a cardboard note found near the ute. The details have been revealed after the Melbourne plumber's body was found about 350 metres from his ute on Friday on a deserted highway in the South Australian outback, three months after he vanished. The note suggests Mr Kowalski was bitten after scouring through scrubland to find sticks to place under his tyres for traction when his four-wheel-drive became stuck. Dane Kowalski who was found dead after he desperately tried to free his vehicle, left a tragic note behind . 'There were sticks under the tyres and on the track,' Ms Kowalski said. 'He had been trying to turn the car around and it got stuck.' His mother arrived in Adelaide, hours before the body was found, and travelled to the remote town of Coober Pedy to meet with detectives in the hope of finding her son.

"(CNN)Well, I'll be the first to admit, I got caught off guard on this one. If indeed the assessment of the cockpit voice recording of Germanwings Flight 9525's final moments is an accurate one, it is shocking. It is inconceivable to me that a fellow pilot would use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers. It is my hope that there is more to this uncanny, horrific tragedy than just an extraordinary suicide event. Although a report of normal breathing from the co-pilot in the moments before the crash indicates that he was not incapacitated, how can one really tell? A farfetched idea, but could he have suffered a fit of schizophrenia never diagnosed, or suffered some other mental disorder, perhaps brought on by medication? I know, it's not likely. As an airline pilot, I'm taking this incident personally. Why? A pilot betrayed the public trust. With all the other fears -- terrorism, disappearances of planes, aircraft malfunctions -- how do I reassure my passengers that they should not add medical illness, mental or otherwise, of the pilot to the list? For the moment, I'll have to believe that my customers are intelligent enough to realize that the Germanwings co-pilot is an anomaly. Sure, as with any profession, pilots have isolated cases of stress-related troubles. But we have mechanisms to deal with such problems. One mechanism is very simple: Don't fly. It is incumbent upon us to determine our own fitness for duty. As a matter of fact, on every trip, I have to confirm that status before I electronically sign the flight plan. Whether it's as simple as suffering from the common cold or suffering from the distraction of a nasty divorce, airline pilots can just say ""no"" to flying. As part of the hiring process, we completed a psychological evaluation. With my airline, one part of the evaluation involved a written test that asked obscure questions in different ways. Another part of the test involved pilots listening to an air traffic control recording made during the angst of a thunderstorm event while at the same time completing a battery of math and shape-orientation problems. We were then asked questions specific to the conversations between the air traffic controllers and pilots we'd heard in the recording. The test was a measure of our multitasking abilities and our abilities to deal with stress. In addition, the airline's doctor conducted an individual mental evaluation. Airline pilots in the United States are required by the Federal Aviation Administration to take a medical examination once every six months. The examination is mostly physical, but the doctor is expected to ask some basic mental health questions, most of them about depression or alcohol consumption. In addition to requiring pilots to indicate any prior health issues during the previous six months, the application for the exam also compels us to self-disclose the use of medications, specifically for the treatment of depression. If we have consulted a therapist, that also has to be disclosed. Yes, all bets are off if we deceive the system

"Golden State's Stephen Curry scored 40 points, including a 3-pointer in the final seconds of regulation to complete a 20-point, fourth-quarter comeback that allowed the Golden State Warriors to beat New Orleans 123-119 in overtime Thursday and take a 3-0 lead in their first-round play-off series. The dramatic win by the Warriors was mirrored by Chicago's double-overtime victory over Milwaukee. The Bulls also established a 3-0 series lead, as did Cleveland against Boston.

"Patients at a hospital A&E department are being forced to parade details of their conditions on laminated signs. They are assessed by staff when they arrive, then given a red card if their illness is serious or a green one for less urgent issues, with a two or three-word summary of their ailment. These are designed to speed up staff assessments as patients wait for treatment, but the trial scheme has been described as ‘insensitive’ and like ‘a police line-up’. Elizabeth Reid, 49, has criticised a hospital after she was forced to wear a sign detailing her condition while waiting for treatment . It means those with alcohol, mental health and gynaecological problems, and others who might prefer to keep their conditions private, could be at risk of losing patient confidentiality. Elizabeth Reid, 49, said she was appalled when she went to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, and was given a green card detailing her ankle injury after she was assessed by a nurse. ‘I didn’t mind much for me as I had hurt my ankle,’ she added. ‘But I thought it was disgusting that patients with alcohol problems or mental health issues had to carry cards that showed everyone what was wrong with them.’ The mother of five from Chelmsford has complained to hospital bosses about the scheme. She said for those ‘carrying signs saying they had alcohol problems, it just smacked of them being marked out – it was like a police line-up’. Mrs Reid added: ‘The poor man in front of me was looking after his teenage daughter, who had alcohol poisoning, and everyone could see what was wrong with her. ‘I could see why every single person in the queue was there – and we had to wait in a line that went past lots of people sitting down waiting, so they could all see what was wrong with us too. It’s really poor for patient confidentiality.’ Hospital bosses at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, said it was designed to speed up staff assessments . She suggested it would be possible to obscure the details written on the cards, leaving the colour visible for staff, but said patients coming into A&E might be too distressed or distracted to think of doing this. ‘The people who come in are panicking or in pain,’ she added. ‘They could see anyone they know as it’s a local hospital, and they have to carry these cards showing what’s wrong with them.’ Another woman who visited the hospital said: ‘I had a laminated card and actually laughed at the insensitivity. I had a very negative experience, having just moved here from another county, and as a nurse myself was quite disheartened with the overall care I received at a sensitive time to myself and my family.’ The trust responsible for the hospital has defended the scheme, saying it will lead to quicker assessment times. The trial scheme has been described as ‘insensitive’ and like ‘a police line-up’ (picture posed by models) Dr Donald McGeachy, medical director of the Mid-Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, said:

Researchers found women judged to have pretty faces also have voices regarded by men as appealing. ‘People can make quite reliable guesses about women’s facial attractiveness on the basis of their voices,’ said study co-author Markus Koppensteiner, an anthropologist from the University of Vienna. He added: ‘Attractive voices may create an idea about what a woman will look like.’ Researchers photographed the faces and recorded the voices of 42 women with an average age of 24. They then asked a group of men – with an average age of mid 20s – to rate the women’s voices on attractiveness and another group of similar age to judge the attractiveness of their faces. Those rated highly for looks often scored well for sound too, with the study finding a ‘significant relationship between males’ ratings of female faces and voices. Findings suggest that women with an attractive face also tend to have an attractive voice’. The scientists also mapped the shape, size and layout of the women’s faces to work out which facial traits were considered to be more attractive both physically and vocally. They found women deemed the most attractive tended to have ‘lifted jawbones, less robust jaws and fuller lips’. The research could shed light on the visual and vocal appeal of radio broadcasters such as Fearne Cotton. Mr Koppensteiner added: ‘It could explain why women who have made it (on radio) also have attractive faces.’ Previous research has indicated women also pay close attention to men’s voices, preferring a deeper pitch because they associate it with a larger body size.

"(CNN)Even if you're sweating on the treadmill and grunting at the weight machine, you're probably still forgetting 57 important muscles that define part of who you are and how others perceive you and even help manage your mental well-being. They're in your face. Face Love Fitness, a pop-up boutique in downtown Manhattan, offers face workouts and massages to keep the skin and muscles of the face and neck healthy, looking young and feeling good. ""The popular notion that one should avoid touching one's face for fear of creating wrinkles is completely incorrect. Skin responds beautifully to mindful touch,"" says Rachel Lang, an esthetician (skin care therapist), who co-founded the Face Love skin gym with massage therapist Heidi Frederick and personal trainer Kate Gyllenhaal. Not all skin experts agree. Some dermatologists, including Dr. Patricia K. Farris, a clinical associate professor at Tulane University, say that exercising facial muscles is counterintuitive to dermatologists. They treat lines and wrinkles caused by facial muscle movement, called dynamic wrinkles, with the muscle relaxing medication botulinum toxin, commonly known by the brand name ""Botox."" ""I do think there could be some value to relaxation and stress relief provided by massage, but exercising facial muscles will not make you look younger and may even make you look older,"" says Farris. But proponents of massage say healthy, youthful skin is well-worked skin. ""When you stimulate pressure receptors under the skin, as you do in a moderate pressure massage, you increase the temperature of the skin, you slow down the physiology, you reduce the release of stress hormones and enhance immune function"" according to Tiffany Field, Ph.D., director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine. ""Just as massage and exercise contributes to health in general, it would also be expected to contribute to skin health."" This is the philosophy at the skin gym, where they say the massage and movement is detoxifying and increases oxygen and blood circulation to the skin, which can result in fewer wrinkles, a firmer jaw line, improved skin tone, and even reduced headaches and eyestrain, according to Lang. ""It is like any exercise, you need to do it two to three times a week for the best results."" It may look a little silly, contorting your facial expressions as Lang drags a plastic roller across your face, or trying to lift your eyebrows against the resistance of an elastic band across your forehead, but the effect of working out your face is pleasantly refreshing. Under the skin there is an area of fatty tissue called the subcutaneous layer. It diminishes with age. The loss of this area contributes to decreased firmness, giving facial skin an older, tired look. Exercising the facial muscles tones and lifts the skin because your facial muscles are attached to your skin and the bone like a web that forms the shape of your face. Through the massages and resistance training, Face Love Fitness claims muscles in the face become stronger and taut, rejuvenating the appearance of the face. ""This is great for everyone, it doesn't

"(CNN)Adi Shankar had the idea for ""Power/Rangers"" when he was 7 years old. ""This was before the Internet, and my access to TV and video games was pretty limited,"" the producer recalled Thursday, in the midst of the ""Power/Rangers"" frenzy. ""So all you really had was (to) tell people stories. So I'd tell people 'Captain Planet' stories, and then I started telling them these dark 'Power Ranger' stories. ""And I got into trouble,"" he added. ""Because the parents were like, 'This guy, he's ruining our children!' "" That was more than 20 years ago for Shankar. But the producer, now 30, got his wish when his dark version of the ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" directed by friend Joseph Kahn, made it online -- and proceeded to rack up more than 11 million views on YouTube in less than two days. Fans buzzing over bloody 'Power/Rangers' 'bootleg' In some ways, Shankar is still getting into trouble. Not only did the video explode the Power Rangers mythology, showing the impact of serving as ""child soldiers,"" in Shankar's phrase, but the video became a legal football after the owner of the franchise, Saban Entertainment, claimed infringement. First it was taken down from Vimeo and then YouTube. However, it was reposted in both places late Friday after lawyers reached agreement, Deadline reported. Among the additions: a disclaimer from Shankar that his ""bootleg"" is ""my take on the FAN FILM. Not a pilot, not a series, not for profit, strictly for exhibition. This is a bootleg experiment not affiliated or endorsed by Saban Entertainment or Lionsgate nor is it selling any product. I claim no rights to any of the characters (don't send me any money, not kickstarted, this film is free)."" Saban Entertainment has its own plans to reboot the popular '90s franchise with a theatrical film scheduled for 2016. 'An interesting experiment' So who are these guys, anyway? Kahn is a famed music video director, probably best known for Britney Spears' ""Toxic,"" Eminem's ""Without Me"" (for which he won a Grammy) and Taylor Swift's ""Blank Space."" He's also handled a number of commercials and the films ""Detention"" and ""Torque."" Shankar is a producer of such films as ""The Grey,"" ""Killing Them Softly"" and ""Dredd."" This isn't the first time he's made a ""bootleg"" short. Previous videos have included one featuring Marvel's Punisher character and one drawing from Marvel's Venom character. In a Reddit AMA, Kahn said that ""Power/Rangers"" was ""self-funded."" A special effects house, Ingenuity Engine, ""worked six months on this and took a bath financially,"" he added. Shankar declined to give a budget for ""Power/Rangers,"" which was shot over a few days last year, but says it was mainly financed through favors and the principals' money. ""It was all favors,"" he says, noting that star James Van Der Beek ""is one of my best friends."" The film also starred ""Battlestar Galactica's"" Katee Sackhoff. Both Shankar and Kahn like to subvert concepts and cliches. Kahn said he was drawn to ""Power/Rangers"" because ""it was an interesting experiment to play with reboot culture and tone control.

"The chairman of the House Oversight Committee is issuing subpoenas to two Secret Service agents who witnessed an episode in which two allegedly intoxicated agency officials drove through a secure area at the White House, interrupting a bomb investigation. Oversight Committee head Jason Chaffetz said the agents can shed light not only on the March 4 incident, 'but also on why the Secret Service appears to be systemically broken and in desperate need of both leadership and reform.' Chaffetz had asked Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to allow four agents and officers to testify at a hearing last week on the March 4 incident. Clancy declined the request and instead testified as the sole witness. Scroll down for video . The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, is issuing subpoenas to two Secret Service agents who witnessed an episode in which two allegedly intoxicated agency officials drove through a secure area at the White House, interrupting a bomb investigation . Chaffetz had asked Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to allow four agents and officers to testify at a hearing last week on the March 4 incident. Clancy declined the request and instead testified as the sole witness. Clancy is pictured here at the hearing . The committee is trying to get to the bottom of allegations that two senior agents had been drinking when they drove into the area and nudged a construction barrier with their vehicle as they intruded on the investigation of a suspicious item. Chaffetz said the committee's top priority in its review of the incident is to ensure that the Secret Service keeps the president and his family safe. But he also wants the agency to be transparent. The Republican lawmaker said Department of Homeland Security, the parent organization of the Secret Service, 'requested that information remain secret and be kept from Congress and the American people.' 'Those restrictions are unacceptable. Under such restrictions, the Committee cannot perform its essential duties to evaluate and propose much-needed legislative reforms for this troubled agency,' Chaffetz said. Clancy has been criticized for the agency's handling of the incident and has complained that he was not told about it for five days, which he called unacceptable. He said he only learned about the misbehavior from discussions about an anonymous email that was circulating within the agency. The email described the off-duty agents as 'both extremely intoxicated' and confused about the investigation activity. It said uniformed Secret Service officers at the scene 'were going to arrest both of them, but the UD (Uniform Division) watch commander said not to.' Because Clancy was not made aware of the incident for several days, he was unable to keep surveillance footage that could have shed further light on the matter from being destroyed. It is Secret Service policy to toss out tapes after 72 hours. The only videos that remain from the night in question are those taken of the investigation into the suspected bomb and they do not give a complete picture of what happened after the agents bumped into the barrier.

"Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen admitted recruiting three female officers into a prostitution ring . An army officer whose role was to advocate for victims of sexual abuse has been dishonorably discharged and sentenced to two years in prison for organizing a prostitution ring at an army base. Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen recruited the female soldiers to serve as prostitutes for high ranking officers at Fort Hood in Texas - one of the biggest bases in the country. As his court-martial was about to open earlier this week, he pleaded guilty to 15 counts that included charges of pandering and conspiracy to solicit prostitution. One female officer was told she could make lots of money at swinger and stripper parties, while another claimed McQueen arranged for her to have sex with an officer for $100. Two soldiers testified last year that McQueen recruited them and other cash-strapped female soldiers to join the prostitution ring. A military judge sentenced him to two years in prison and a dishonorable discharge while leading a sexual abuse prevention program at the sprawling Central Texas post. However, he pleaded not guilty to sexual assault. One of the female soldiers had previously testified that McQueen arranged for her to have sex for $100 with an officer, Master Sergeant Brad Grimes. But prosecutors told Judge Lieutenant Colonel Rebecca Connally that while there were plans for a tryst, the two never had sex. The woman had told investigators she was 20 when she confided in McQueen about money problems after her husband left her and her three-year-old son and drained the couple's bank account. She also testified that McQueen had sex with her and took photos of her naked to show potential clients. Grimes has already been demoted and reprimanded after he was found guilty by a jury conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery. Initial charges were filed against McQueen in March 2014. Fort Hood officials haven't indicated whether anyone involved in the conspiracy actually had sex, according to the San Antonio Express-News. In addition to trying to recruit the young female soldiers, McQueen admitted trying to get two higher ranking officers to agree to have sex with junior female officers. McQueen admitted breaching his role as an advocate for sexual abuse by encouraging the prostitution ring at Fort Hood army base .

"Nearly half of the Radio Rentals customers have been found to be on welfare payments, and they are not just renting household necessities. The ABC have reported that those who receive Centrelink payments made up half of Radio Rental's income last year. Of the $197 million of revenue they made, $90 million came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay. Rental company Radio Rentals has been getting nealry half of its yearly revenue from Centrelink . Centrelink's service, Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service that helps to manage welfare funds . Of that $90 million in expenditure, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, smart phones, sound systems and other home theatre devices. The shocking reality is that the consumer leasing company relies on revenue from the Australian welfare system. A report released by finance company Credit Suisse has expressed that any change in the rules that regulate the consumer leasing industry would have a huge effect on Radio Rentals and their business. Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service offered by Centrelink and deducts welfare payments in manageable amounts in order to pay nominated bills. Those bills can be toward rent, electricity, gas, water, ambulance or medical services and many more. This service aims to make budgeting easier for customers and caters to rental companies as it encourages smaller, broken up bills. Of the $90 million in expenditure, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen TVs . The reality is that the consumer leasing company relies on revenue from the Australian welfare system . Consumer Action Law Centre chief executive officer Gerard Brody told the ABC that there have been worries about the white goods leasing market leader Radio Rentals for a while now. 'We have had long-held concerns about Radio Rentals and the consumer lease industry's use of the Centrepay system,' he said. Radio Rentals is currently Australia's leading household appliance, technology and furniture rental company and boasts that it gives everyone a 'fair go,' with no immediate deposits required.

"Living legend Candice Bergen says at 68 she is happy being fat and lives to eat . At 68 and after a full and varied career which has taken in modeling for Vogue, an Oscar-nomination and countless Emmys for her hit TV show Murphy Brown, Candice Bergen says she is happy being fat and now lives to eat. In her new memoir, A Fine Romance, the living legend estimates she has put on 30 pounds in the past 15 years, but says she simply doesn't care. 'In the past 15 years... I have put on 30 pounds. I live to eat. None of this ""eat to live"" stuff for me. I am a champion eater. No carb is safe — no fat, either,' she readily admits. 'At a recent dinner party I shared bread and olive oil, followed by chocolate ice cream with my husband. A woman near me looked at me, appalled, and I thought, ""I don't care,""' she writes. Women over 50 typically have to choose between preserving either their face or their butts and she writes that she has happily chosen the former. 'Dieting is out of my purview,' she confesses. 'I crave cookies... all the things that dilate my pupils.' Her skinny friends and their constant battles to remain thin only reinforce her belief that she is doing what is right for her. 'They maintain their weight by routinely vomiting after major meals consisting of a slice of steak or a filet of fish,' she writes. 'I am incapable of this.' In her new book, A Fine Romance, Candice Bergen talks at her joy at playing feisty TV reporter Murphy Brown for 10 seasons. 'She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless,' she writes . The brutally honest appraisal of her current weight is just one of the topics up for discussioin in her new book, which comes out on April 7, reports Vogue. The follow-up to her 1984 memoir Knock Wood, A Fine Romance focuses on her 15-year marriage to French director Louis Malle who died of cancer in 1995 and her career-defining role as funny, feisty career woman and TV news reporter Murphy Brown. The hit TV show ran for ten seasons between 1989 and 1998 and Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five. After her fifth win, Bergen declined future nominations for the role. Initially she writes that she wasn't thrilled at the idea of acting in a TV show, but after reading the script she realized it was 'written for me.' 'The lead was a television news reporter. She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless. 'Smart, fast-paced, and funny, the dialogue was similar to the great comedies of the 1940s.

"A fashion photographer who was asked by designer Alexander McQueen to take a special series of backstage photographs 11 years ago is showcasing the images in a dramatic tableau for the first time. Nick Knight says the renowned designer invited him to take the snaps at his iconic McQueen Black Event in 2004. The London show featured an atmospheric showcase of black pieces, some from the archive and others designed specifically for the night. Scroll down for video . Fashion photographer Nick Knight has created a stunning series of images created from backstage photographs of Alexander McQueen's 2004 show . Now using material he shot backstage at the event, Mr Knight has now created the unique image called Black, collating the previously unseen photographs of 35 outfits modelled by Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Gemma Ward and Lily Cole among others. Mr Knight says he was asked by McQueen to photograph each model backstage with a view to creating a composite image for the future, and now, more than a decade later, the designer’s vision has now been realised. Mr Knight said: ‘As a close collaborator and friend of McQueen, I had the honour of filming many of his photo shoots from the mid-Nineties onwards.’ 'McQueen was so excited as he neared the completion of the collection for the American Express Black event, he insisted we found a way to shoot it behind the scenes at Earls Court where the show was being held. 'He knew the Black Event was an important moment that should be preserved and shown to the world, so this project has been a great way for me to reflect upon and celebrate our working relationship.

American Express supported McQueen in his early years as a trailblazing creative, and was privileged to accompany him on the meteoric rise from cutting edge designer to global name. ‘Our partnership with the V&A and the Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty retrospective has given us an exciting opportunity to work with Nick again and to commission this beautiful image, which is a wonderful tribute to our past collaborations with McQueen.’ McQueen was one of the UK's most controversial fashion stars, a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs.

He was awarded 0/10 by Spanish newspaper Marca following Barcelona's recent 2-1 El Clasico win and saw two fans attack his car as he left the ground after the match. But Bale didn't appear to be showing any signs of rust as he took Israel apart, a team that hadn't lost a competitive game in two and a half years. ""To come out on top is amazing. The first half was very hard. We did a lot of running, closed them down well, and luckily got the goal which gave us a lot of confidence,"" Bale told British broadcaster Sky Sports after the game. ""We came out in the second half buzzing and showed what a good team we are."" he added. Italy, Czech Republic held . Meanwhile Italy narrowly avoided defeat against Bulgaria. A flurry of first half goals in Sofia had given Bulgaria a 2-1 lead, a lead they looked to have held on to. But late in the game Brazilian-born striker Eder scored on his debut to spare Italy's blushes. The Czech Republic also narrowly avoided defeat, against lowly Latvia. Vaclav Pilar's last-minute equalizer in Prague was just enough to keep them top of the group, with Iceland hot on their heels after a 3-0 victory against Kazakhstan.

"Sian Gibson, 51 (pictured), consulted her GP about an unusual freckle she found on her ankle . As a redhead, 51-year-old Sian Gibson was used to having freckles — they’d covered her arms, face and chest since childhood. But in 2008, she noticed a new freckle, darker than usual and larger — the size of a small fingernail — on her ankle. ‘I don’t have many freckles on my legs, so I noticed it straight away,’ says Sian, a mother of three and grandmother of five. ‘My GP told me it was nothing and not to worry about it. But, of course, I did. At the time, there was a campaign about the importance of early detection of skin cancer. Every time I caught sight of the freckle, I would be reminded of how much I wanted to be around for my family.’ However, instead of returning to her GP to ask for a hospital appointment, Sian, from Boston, Lincolnshire, turned to her mobile phone for medical advice. ‘I’d recently got an iPhone and was downloading the apps that were just becoming available,’ she says. ‘One evening, I searched online for “large freckle” and found my way to a free app that claimed to be a mole evaluator that would identify at-risk moles. I thought: “Why not? What have I got to lose?” ’ Sian was ahead of the times. Apps, short for applications — programs that can be downloaded to run on a smartphone — were few and far between in 2008. Today, they’ve become essential to most people’s lives. With 100,000 health apps available in Britain and more launching every week, the medical sector is a market leader — with apps to track calories consumed and kilometres jogged, give first aid advice, provide cognitive behavioural therapy for phobias and remind people to take medication. One in five health apps claims to support a diagnosis, as with Sian’s mole app. One program turns your mobile phone into an electrocardiogram, tracking heart rhythms and emailing the results to a doctor, while others allow patients to record blood pressure or blood sugar. In 2013, the global market for health apps was worth $2.4 billion, according to market research firm research2guidance — and this is predicted to rise to $26 billion by 2017. The NHS has launched the Health and Symptom Checker, and the use of apps in the health service is only set to increase. Last week, it emerged that the NHS is now helping to launch apps to help people cope with depression. ‘We know people are more likely to make healthy choices if they can set their own goals,’ says Bradford GP Dr Shahid Ali, professor of digital health at Salford University. ‘And there’s evidence that with health apps, people are able to have a more grown-up relationship with their doctors and nurses.’ A handful of GPs have welcomed the technology to their practices. Dr Jagdeesh Dhaliwal, a GP in Walsall, West Midlands, says three or four of the 40 or so patients he sees a day bring along their phones

"Scientists claim they are one step closer to creating a drug that can cure HIV. A team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor-like machinery to recognise the HIV virus. In their tests, they found that the technique could completely remove up to 72 per cent of cells that had been infected with HIV. A team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor-like machinery to recognise the HIV virus (pictured) CRISPR technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code . Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the Crispr system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. The DNA cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally, for instance after chronic sun exposure. But unlike UV rays that can result in genetic alterations, the Crispr system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome. When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome. 'Evolution has led to some of the most astonishing mechanisms for protecting organisms against their natural pathogens,' says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor of Salk's Gene Expression Laboratory in California. 'Understanding the immune responses by which bacteria protect themselves against viral infections has allowed us to engineer novel platforms for the targeting of devastating viruses, such as HIV, in human patients.' When a copy of the HIV virus sneaks into a human cell, it can cause havoc. It takes control of the cell's own molecular machinery to made copies of the virus's genetic material and then buries these copies in the cell's own genes. From there, the host's cell becomes an HIV factory, making new copies of the virus to spread throughout the body. Existing HIV drugs target individual steps of this lifecycle; some stop the virus from integrating into cells' DNA, for instance, while others try to stop the affected cells from producing more virus. The problem with these drugs, explains Hsin-Kai Liao, a research associate in the Izpisua Belmonte lab, is that they don't actually remove the copies of the virus that are hidden within cells' DNA. These copies can remain dormant for years and then activate again. 'Patients normally need to take drugs every day or every week for their whole lives, because of the HIV that can be latent,' says Professor Liao. 'This costs money, time and effort.' To combat this problem, the team turned to a molecular defence system called CRISPR that bacteria use to cut up foreign DNA at specified spots. Since its recent discovery, scientists have started using CRISPR to edit genes. But the researchers were also intrigued by its defensive ability and wondered if CRISPR could be programmed to slice and destroy viruses inside human cells. The new Salk study showed that the method is effective against active, full-length HIV rather than a shortened, inactive version of the virus. Pictured

"It's one of India's most colourful festivals and when Princess Beatrice was invited to get involved during a London cocktail party thrown to celebrate it, she just couldn't resist getting stuck in. Luckily for Beatrice, that meant bindi accessories inspired by the sub-continent rather than the paint-throwing that characterises the real thing. The 26-year-old was back on the fashion circuit for the second time in less than seven days, having stepped out for the gala launch of the Alexander McQueen Savage Beauty retrospective last week. Bright spark: Princess Beatrice got into the spirit of the event with a set of bright green bindis . Looking good: Beatrice looked lovely in an emerald-green dress with a striking sequinned bodice . On that occasion, Beatrice, who is recently returned from the US where she went back to school to study a brief course in finance, opted for a daring thigh-high gown. This time, the Princess, who was attending a party thrown by London-based Indian designer Saloni Lodha, opted for a striking emerald-green dress and a forehead decorated with bindis. Ms Lodha, who grew up in Mumbai but has also lived in Seoul and Hong Kong, launched her eponymous label in 2008 and counts Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama among her fans. Now stocked at Net-a-Porter and Matches among others, she is famous for her love of colourful print and flatteringly feminine designs. But Ms Lodha wasn't the only print fan at the party, with fellow designer, Greek-born Mary Katrantzou, also in attendance. All smiles: Beatrice posed with Ms Lodha who was wearing one of her own eye-catching designs . Fashion fan: Beatrice has become a familiar face on the London fashion party circuit of late . Support: Last week, she turned out for the opening of the V&A's Savage Beauty McQueen retrospective . Ms Katrantzou has long championed the digital print and regularly shows eye-wateringly colourful designs at London Fashion Week. Beatrice, who also attended London Fashion Week, has become a familiar face on London's party circuit of late. A week before the McQueen Savage Beauty retrospective, the 26-year-old was pictured rubbing shoulders with actor Martin Sheen at another VIP event. Joined by Branson clan, Beatrice and Mr Sheen held court at a gala dinner at the Bulgari Hotel held in aid of We Day. Beatrice is, like her cousin Prince Harry, a supporter of the initiative which encourages young people to get involved in political life.

"We all know the time-consuming hassle of having to hoover the house, so it is perhaps no surprise to find that sailors on board this Russian aircraft carrier also got bored of sweeping the decks. What is perhaps more surprising is their solution to the problem, which involved strapping an old jet engine to the front of a tractor, and using the contraption as a huge leaf-blower. The crew of the Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's largest warship, came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing. Russian sailors on board the Admiral Kuznetsov, the country's largest aircraft carrier, have come up with an inegnious way of cleaning the decks, by strapping an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor . Debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines, so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck, but the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother . Even a single stray nut or bolt, if sucked into one of the fighter plane's engines, could spell disaster for the pilot, and cause millions of dollars worth of damage. Usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects, using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up. But with 14,700sq ft of deck space to check and recheck every single day, the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother, and took a more direct approach. According to blog Foxtrot Alpha, the sailors have attached an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor, before fitting the front end with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the ship's deck. The vehicle is then driven up and down the 1,000ft-long deck, blowing all debris overboard. The massive Kuznetsov is the jewel in President Putin's military fleet, carrying a total of 18 fighter jets and 17 anti-submarine helicopters. The ingenious crew members fitted the old MiG engine with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the deck, and use the contraption like an enormous leaf blower, sending debris overboard . The Kuznetsov has a deck spanning 14,700sqft, so rather than search the entire thing by hand, Russian sailors built themselves a giant leaf-blowing machine instead . Bristling with anti-aircraft cannons, rocket batteries, gatling guns and underwater missiles, it weighs in at 43,000 tons and carries 1,690 crew. However, that is nothing compared to the US Nimitz Class aircraft carriers, the tenth and last of which, the George HW Bush, was commissioned in 2009. The ship weighs 102,000 tons, is powered by two on board nuclear reactors and is capable of carrying almost 6,000 crew and air company who pilot its 90 aircraft and helicopters. The UK's largest carrier in the HMS Queen Elizabeth, weighing in at 65,00 tonnes, it carries 40 jets and helicopters, along with 1,600 crew. The Kuznetsov is the largest carrier in the Russian Navy, built it 1985 it carries 18 fighter jets, 17 anti-submarine helicopters and

"A Russian man who killed his estranged wife by throwing petrol over her and setting her alight while she was at work in a supermarket has been jailed. Shocking CCTV images of the attack that shows the 25-year-old victim going up in flames and running through the store caused outrage across Russia, and led to widespread calls for a crackdown on violence against women. Murderer Alexander Efimov, 33, had drunk a bottle of vodka and was three times over the drink driving limit when he was arrested - and initially said the attack was his wife Ana's fault, because she refused to get back together with him. Scroll down for video . Ablaze: Harrowing CCTV footage captured the moment that Alexander Efimov doused his ex-wife in petrol while she was working in a supermarket, after she refused to get back together with him . The couple split up in 2011, and a Russian court heard that Efimov constantly pestered her, accusing her of sleeping with other men, of cheating on him when they were together and pleading him to get back together with him. In March 2014 Efimov went to the Magnit superrmarket where she worked, and asked again if she would get back together with him.

"A shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya has been released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the west of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. This follows another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film. It raises fears that ISIS is consolidating its presence on the 'doorstep of Europe', as Libya is just a few hundred miles from the coast of Italy. Scroll down for video . Thirty Ethiopian Christians appear to have been beheaded and shot by ISIS in a sickening new propaganda video. Above, at least 16 men are marched down a beach in Libya by militants before they are killed . Ethiopia was unable to confirm its citizens were killed in the footage but condemned the 'atrocious act', a government official said. The video shows the men at the coast wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits and being held at the neck by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces. The victims inland are forced to kneel as militants dressed in combats and green masks stand behind them holding rifles. It starts with what it called a 'history of Christian-Muslim relations', which includes scenes of militants destroying churches, graves and icons. A masked fighter in black then brandishes a pistol as he vows to kill Christians if they do not convert. In an apparent reference to Ethiopia's attacks on neighbouring Somalia, whose population is almost entirely Muslim, he says: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again.' The footage, which was released on websites and social media accounts officially linked to ISIS, also cuts to Christians in Syria explaining how they were given the choice of converting to Islam or paying a 'special tax'. At the end it switches between the two sets of captives - thought to be mainly migrant workers - with one group shot dead at point-blank range and the others beheaded on the beach. The video has not yet been verified. The men - wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits - are held at the neck and forced to kneel by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces . The men, thought to be migrant works, are described by Islamic State in the video as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church' The footage also shows around 12 men being shot in a desert area, believed to be in the south of the country, by militants wearing green balaclavas and combats .

"The appliance of science behind Ronny Deila’s Celtic reign was there for all to see on Sunday afternoon. Any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as Aberdeen’s resistance. Despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding, frustrating 90 minutes against Inter Milan three days previously – and the associated, sleep-disturbing travelling – Deila’s team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4-0 victory. It was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus. The Norwegian’s insistence that Celtic could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure. It was interpreted – or perhaps misinterpreted – as a slight on predecessor Neil Lennon. Ronny Deila's Celtic side are starting to become formidable under the Norwegian's reign at Parkhead . But this much is clear. Deila has unquestionably made the Parkhead side more formidable in that regard. And he has all the stats to back it up. Including one which earned recent arrival Gary Mackay-Steven a rapid (in more ways than one) gold star. Crunching the numbers after matches is an important aspect of Deila’s work when it comes to assessing various aspects of his players’ performances. To the 39-year-old, these reams of figures produced by the technology at Celtic’s disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion. The hope is that it leads to better decisions. Again, there would have been a few from the football old-school previously willing to raise an eyebrow at such talk. But what happened at the weekend provided a riposte to any sneers. Deila (centre) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics . ‘I think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective,’ said Deila. ‘There are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results, but I think we have had six victories after coming home from European games. That’s really good. You don’t see that around the other European leagues. Inter Milan lost at the weekend and they are struggling a lot when they come back — so we did well to win in that way. ‘The amount of metres and sprints on Sunday was unbelievable when you consider we played three days before. We have increased the high-intensity running by 30-40 percent since the summer. That is a lot. Gary Mackay-Steven (right) ran an impressive 1300 metres against Aberdeen on Sunday . ‘We want to be direct, we want to create things, we want to have penetration, we want to be a high-pressing team, so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform.’ Asked if he knew which of his players topped the various statistic tables, Deila broke into a grin. ‘I know everything about the players,’ he laughed. ‘When we played Inter at home, their striker, Rodrigo Palacio, ran 1250 metres at

"Los Angeles (CNN)No one knew him by his real name. But on the harsh streets of Skid Row that became his home, he was known as Africa. Surveillance footage, police and homeless community activists paint wildly different pictures of the man -- one who could be violent, benevolent, troubled and altruistic. Africa was shot and killed by Los Angeles police Sunday after he scuffled with officers. The shooting, caught on video, has renewed accusations of police brutality because it showed him already on the ground. Police say he tried to reach for an officer's gun. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has identified Africa, but is not releasing his real name pending notification of relatives. Africa came to the United States from the continent about a decade ago, said a friend who would only be identified as Nick G. Like Africa, Nick had also been homeless on the streets of Skid Row -- a decrepit area wrought with poverty and despair. ""He wanted to get away from here, he wanted to go back home,"" Nick said. ""He was very depressed. Very, very depressed. He had a good side to him, a good heart."" Africa kept a tent outside the Union Rescue Mission homeless shelter. Even though the shelter was right in front of him, he didn't want the help. Instead, Africa often helped the shelter's employees. ""Our cleaning guys -- he would help them organize cleaning of (the) sidewalk,"" said the Rev. Andy Bales, the shelter's CEO. He described Africa as gentle and kind -- but with an erratic side. ""I attribute the erratic behavior to this difficult environment out here."" Less than an hour before he was killed Sunday, a nearby security camera showed Africa apparently dealing drugs -- the sad and only real currency of Skid Row's economy. The footage then shows Africa getting into a fight with the man in the orange tent next to him, violently tipping the tent and kicking the man. Police arrive and talk to Africa, but he jumps into the tent -- prompting officers to draw their guns. Africa then jumps out, swinging his arms at police. Los Angeles police say he tried to grab an officer's gun, and that's when he was shot. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck called the incident ""an extreme tragedy."" ""We feel great compassion in the LAPD for people who live in conditions of homelessness, and often mental illness, with no treatment,"" Beck said. ""We prepare our officers to deal as best they can with them, but the reality is this is much more than a problem that the police alone can solve."" Bales said the dismal conditions of LA's Skid Row makes it a tinder box for more problems. ""There is no other major city in the U.S. that has a skid row like ours,"" he said. ""2,000 human beings living on the street. Until we deal with that, we're going to continue to have an explosive situation."" On the sidewalk where Africa was shot, a modest memorial sits atop a small pile of belongings. ""RIP Cameroon,""

"A debate between two Oklahoma roommates about whether an iPhone is better than an Android ended in a violent brawl with a stabbing and assault using beer bottles. Jiaro Mendez and Elias Acevedo were both found to be 'highly intoxicated' by Tulsa police following the fight that broke out in the parking lot of their shared apartment on April 14 around 1am. The men were arguing over which phone was better, police said. The pair, covered in blood, were taken to hospital where they were treated for lacerations to their body, and Acevedo, 21, has since been arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon, according to the police report. Scroll down for video . Oklahoma roommates Jiaro Mendez and Elias Acevedo were both found to be 'highly intoxicated' by Tulsa police following the fight that broke out in the parking lot of their shared apartment (in both frames Acevedo pictured) Acevedo (above), 21, has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon following the incident . It was not revealed in the report which of the men was a fan of the iPhone or the Android. 'It was a petty argument over their cell phones which one was better than the other. There was alcohol involved and it turned violent and there were some assaults that occurred,' Tulsa Police Cpl. Dave Young told Newson6. Police said they responded to a report of a stabbing and found the men covered in blood who were taken to hospital where they were treated for lacerations to their body (above scenes following the fight) When officers arrived at the scene, they said they found a couple of beer bottles on the ground (above scenes from the incident as police arrest Acevedo) Mendez told police that Acevedo hit him in back of the head with a beer bottle (above scenes following the incident outside of Evergreen Apartments) Mendez told police, who responded to a report of a stabbing, that Acevedo had allegedly hit him in the back of the head with a beer bottle following the debate and then stole his car. When officers arrived at Evergreen Apartments, there were a couple of broken beer bottles on the ground as Mendez was found covered in blood and had lacerations to his head and body. He was then taken to hospital as officers then went to the apartment where they found Acevedo, also covered in blood with lacerations on his body following the brawl.

"The Greek foreign minister has claimed that his country deserves EU help because it has not committed crimes on the scale of the Holocaust – while Germany has confirmed that it will not pay Greece war reparations. Angela Merkel met far-Left Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Berlin yesterday – his first visit to Germany since he came to power in January. Mr Tsipras is understood to have told the German Chancellor that Greece would face insolvency within weeks without the release of more funds.

The Greek government is claiming Germany must now repay a loan which was ‘forced’ on Athens in 1942. Pictured: Merkel and Tsipras listen to their countries' national anthems upon his arrival for talks . However the meeting was overshadowed by comments from Nikos Kotzias, the Greek foreign minister, who said in an interview that his country deserved to be treated as leniently as post-war Germany. He suggested that Germany should help set up a commission to come up with a plan to compensate Greece for the suffering caused by the Nazis during the Second World War. The Greek government is claiming that Germany must now repay a loan which was ‘forced’ on Athens in 1942, as well as pay for Nazi atrocities.

He told Suddeutsche Zeitung: ‘The Allies were very generous with Germany; they did not smother Germany. ‘There was an interest to build Germany up again. Don’t we have the same rights?’ He went on to ask if the ‘crimes that our people committed’ were greater than ‘Dachau or Auschwitz’ – referring to two of the most notorious Nazi concentration camps where more than a million people were murdered. At the press conference yesterday, Mr Tsipras also renewed the demand for war reparations, saying: ‘We must work on the issue of forced loans and Second World War reparations.’ However Mrs Merkel said she viewed the demands as an attempt to distract from the need for economic reforms, adding: ‘The issue of war reparations is closed from a political and legal point of view. The topic has no relationship with the crisis and its emergencies.’ Tsipras is expected to present a list of reforms, hoping to

"Taxpayers are having to find £11billion a year to top up the wages of millions of people working in supermarkets and other low paid jobs. The money, which amounts to a massive public subsidy for the companies involved, is paid to some 5.2million workers in the form of tax credits and other benefits. Campaigners say the figures shine a light on how companies making huge profits are relying on the taxpayer to ensure their staff have enough money to put food on the table. The total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax, according to the study by Citizens UK. Critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages . The charity is campaigning for the adoption of the Living Wage - £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 for the rest of the UK - across both the public and private sector. It estimates this would reduce the need for in-work benefits by £6.7bn a year, which would make a massive dent in the £12billion reduction in welfare spending which the Conservatives say is necessary. The current minimum wage for those over 21 is £6.50 an hour and will rise to £6.70 in October, but this is well below what the Government accepts is needed by many people, particularly those with children, to make ends meet. The charity’s report complains: ‘The public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages.’ Its report says Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s posted combined profits of £3.9bn last year, but between them cost the taxpayer more than £750m in benefits paid to their staff. Tesco paid £519m in tax but received £364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers. Asda spent £150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received £221m in benefits. Morrisons’ tax bill was £62m while its 83,000 low-paid workers received £190m in benefits and Sainsbury’s paid £180m in tax, almost exactly as much as its low-paid staff received from the public purse. Of all the profitable companies examined by the charity, Next had the highest average subsidy of £2,087 per head given its high proportion of young employees who are typically paid just above the minimum wage of £6.70 an hour. Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’ Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’. He argued that pushing up wages will block recruitment. ‘For very many people, the retail sector provides useful income and Next has 30 applications for every vacancy. Raising wages too fast will simply reduce employment opportunities,’ he said. Other firms who rely on the taxpayer to top up staff wages include Amazon, fast food outlets and local authorities, where cleaning and care workers, for example, are

"It was only a small-sided game at the end of a session at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground, but heads were turned when teenage striker Chuba Akpom, called over to join them, cut in from the left flank and curled the ball, side-footed, around the goalkeeper to score. The move echoed a former time and a former forward, as if the ghost of Thierry Henry was still haunting the centre’s pitches with his trademark dribble and finish. Alexis Sanchez came running over to Akpom, leaping around excitedly and shouting ‘Titi, Titi, Titi, Titi!’ Arsenal's teenage striker Chuba Akpom has been compared to club legend Thierry Henry . Thierry Henry was Akpom's idol growing up and the youngster is keen to emulate his success . Akpom (left), walks to training with Arsenal team-mates Theo Walcott, Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck . There is still a long, long way to go until the 19-year-old gets anywhere near close to his idol Henry, but nicknames tend to stick around. ‘One day in training with the first team I scored an Henry-type goal, cutting inside and finishing,’ Akpom tells Sportsmail. ‘I could see Sanchez jumping, he’ s an enthusiastic guy at the best of times and he’s going: “Titi, Titi, Titi, Titi!” ‘The next morning he came to me and said “Titi.” 'Then the next morning he came to me and said “Titi.” I asked: 'hold on is this my new nickname?' That’s how it came about and it’s stuck since then. ‘Now the lads just call me Titi or Thierry Henry - I’ll take that. It’s not a bad comparison to have. ‘He was my idol growing up. Playing for the academy and watching Arsenal’s first team I used to see players like Henry scoring every week and it really inspired me.’ Akpom was born and bred in east London’s Canning Town and joined Arsenal aged six. Akpom closes down Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster during September's League Cup tie . Akpom celebrates after scoring during the 2014 International Tournament match with Holland . England U20 play Mexico U20 at 7.45pm on Wednesday 25 March at The Hive, Barnet FC. Tickets for the game at The Hive are priced at £3 for adults and £1.50 for kids and can be purchased by calling 0208 381 3800 or at www.venuetoolbox.com/thehivelondon . Manager Arsene Wenger has been so impressed with his progress the Frenchman has him training with the first team and has included him regularly on the bench this season, featuring several times in the Premier League and FA Cup. Even if the Henry comparisons are premature, there is no denying Akpom is beginning to make his mark where it matters. ‘I’m with the senior team now in the changing room and on the training ground,’ he adds. ‘It’s all about getting familiar with the environment and the players and getting as much game time as I can. ‘A lot of them are international players, a lot are England players; Calum Chambers, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott, Danny Welbeck, Kieran Gibbs. I look up to them.

"Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has heaped praise on Radamel Falcao, claiming his international team-mate can be an 'amazing player' for Manchester United. The shot-stopper will be in Arsenal's FA Cup squad to face United on Monday night, and despite it being unclear whether he or Wojciech Szczesny will start in goal, Ospina will be making sure his team-mates are well aware of Falcao's threat. 'We haven't spoken about the match but we are in contact and I am absolutely convinced and can say with all confidence that Falcao is a player with a winning attitude, he has a strong mentality and is a great professional,' Ospina told the Evening Standard. Radamel Falcao has failed to impress at Manchester United after scoring just four goals in 20 matches . Falcao's international team-mate David Ospina (right) has praised the striker, calling him a 'great professional' 'He has demonstrated that in every team he has ever played in. When he has stability and continuity, he will come to the forefront and he is going to be an amazing player for Manchester United,' Ospina continued. 'We will never underestimate him. He is an excellent forward and I will hope to stop him scoring any goals against us if I play.' Ospina has been instrumental in Arsenal's recent run of form, nailing down the No 1 spot for Arsene Wenger's side. Manchester United are undecided on whether to give Falcao a permanent deal when his loan spell ends . Ospina believes that Falcao (left) can be an 'amazing player' for United if he is given the chance . Despite this, Szczesny was in goal for the Gunners' previous two FA Cup ties and has recovered from an illness which ruled him out of the previous match. Whoever is given the nod is likely to face an out-of-sorts Falcao, who is running out of time to prove himself in the red of Manchester United. The Colombian striker, who plays with Ospina for his country, joined United on deadline day last September in a loan move worth £6million, but is yet to secure a permanent contract. It is believed that the club are as yet undecided on whether to trigger a permanent £43m deal, after Falcao's indifferent form has produced just four goals in 20 matches. Falcao and Ospina have history, as they both play international football for Columbia . Falcao celebrates his last goal for Manchester United, at the end of January against Leicester City .

Virginie Rutgers started to feed her 10-month-old son to soothe him while their plane taxied out from Gold Coast airport . She used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy, but was told to remove it by Virgin Australia staff. ‘He (the flight attendant) started to raise his voice and become quite abusive,’ Ms Rutgers told Seven News. A woman who alleges she witnessed the incident from a couple of seats away has come forward, describing the ‘shocking’ incident on the Virgin Australia Facebook page. Laureen Fairweather insists the mother and child were sitting in separate seats, with the infant using the appropriate regulation seatbelt while he was being fed. ‘The child was not restrained with the carrier at all!

"A teenager caught with a car boot of 20 cannabis joints should not be banned from becoming a teacher or a nurse, Nick Clegg suggested today. The Lib Dem leader was challenged over his call for drug users not to be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances. He said it was ‘ridiculous’ that young people’s future careers could be ‘blighted’ by nothing more than a ‘teenage indiscretion’. Nick Clegg was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record . The Liberal Democrat manifesto will commit the party to ending imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use and ensure that those arrested with small amounts of illicit substances do not get a criminal record. But during his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record. LBC host Nick Ferrari said: ‘I’m an 18-year-old student, I get stopped by police, I have 20 joints in the boot of my car. I subsequently want to become a teacher. Can I become a teacher?’ Mr Clegg insisted that as the law stands that person would not be able to become a teacher. But he said the law needed to be changed: ‘I think it’s completely wrong if some teenager, 17 or 18 year old, dabbles in… I don’t know whether it’s 20 [joints] or one. ‘Do I think their chances of working as a nurse, as a teacher, or a lawyer or a taxi driver should be blighted forever, of course I don’t. ‘If you are a teenager, one in five youngster use drugs, a third of adults have used drugs at some point in their life in this country. ‘What you are saying to me is someone who as a 17 or 18--year-old and has smoked some hassish, and they are caught doing that, you’re saying they should never ever… work as a nurse, as a teacher.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clergg shared a platform with Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson to argue said drug users should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances . Yesterday's announcement follows a controversial ‘research’ project ordered by Lib Dem Home Office ministers, which used taxpayers’ money to study drugs policy around the world. Jeremy Browne and Norman Baker jetted off to examine how other countries tackle drugs. They travelled to ten countries, including the US, Portugal and Sweden, at a cost of almost £40,000. The Lib Dems seized on parts of the report suggesting decriminalisation in countries like Portugal cut the health damage caused by drugs. But critics said they ignored evidence that the number of children using drugs had risen. Pressed again on the scenario of 20 joints, Mr Clegg hit back: ‘If he has got 20 joints is he allowed to be a teacher. ‘Your fixation is whether it was 20. My fixation is whether do I think they should be ruled out forever to work as a teacher. ‘I think it’s ridiculous that we turn what might

"A southern New Jersey woman jailed in an international custody dispute has been freed after spending more than eight years behind bars and is likely to be reunited with her daughter who's been without either parent for nearly a decade. María Jose Carrascosa, a 49-year-old native of Spain, was released from jail Friday night, The Record reported. Carrascosa, formerly of Fort Lee, was paroled last year after moving her daughter, then 5, to Spain when the girl's father, Peter Innes, was granted custody of the child. Freed: María Jose Carrascosa was released from a New Jersey jail on Friday after spending nearly 9 years behind bars for refusing to return her daughter to the United States . Defiant: Carrascosa defiantly refused to bring her daughter back to the United States and thus remained jailed nearly nine years . Once paroled, Carrascosa was taken to the Bergen County Jail for contempt of court for violating a court order to bring the child back. Her release came in part thanks to a letter written to the court by Peter Innes. Superior Court Judge Bonnie Mizdol, ultimately deciding that incarceration would not coerce Carrascosa to comply with child custody orders, ordered her release from jail Friday. Jail time for contempt of court is meant to coerce a person into cooperating with a judges orders, not as a punishment. However, Carrascosa defiantly refused to bring her daughter back to the United States and thus remained jailed. 'The question before this court is whether incarceration has lost its coercive power and has become punitive,' Judge Mizdol said. 'It has become clear that continued incarceration would not compel her to return her daughter, so it would be deemed punitive.' During the hearing, the judge read a letter from Innes, of Hasbrouck Heights, that said he would not oppose Carrascosa's release if she returns to Spain to be with their daughter, Victoria. The judge also read a letter from Victoria, who is now 14, that said: 'My only wish is to be with my mother.' Tearful reunion: Carrascosa had a tearful reunion with her daughter via Skype following her release and says she plans to return to Spain as soon as possible . Finally: Carrascosa's release came after her daughter and estranged husband wrote letters to the court urging a judge to set her free . Dear Victoria, . This is what you've been asking for and I am happy for you this day has finally come. You should know that I did all I could, including petitioning the judge, to help get your mom released. I did this so she can return to you in Spain. Please know, you mom is completely free to immediately leave the United States and return to Spain. I truly hope she is with you tomorrow. For me, this conflict is over. I wish you and your family well and I hope you enjoy your reunion with your mother. I will always be here for you when the time comes that you want to hear the truth as I know it. Love, .

"(CNN)The terrorists who attacked the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia, last week were wearing suicide vests but failed to detonate them before being gunned down by police, Tunisia's President told CNN. ""They had them, but they didn't work, because the police turned up and they were shot down and they didn't have the time to get these vests to work. Because had they done so, we would have had major catastrophe,"" President Beji Caid Essebsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. A third museum attacker remains at large, Essebsi said. Previously two suspects had been identified -- Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou -- though it wasn't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces. Essebsi told Amanpour 15 arrests had been made since Wednesday's attack, in which 23 people were killed. Most of the victims were foreigners and 19 were tourists who'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis. Essebsi said he believed the attackers were members of ISIS who had been trained in Libya. This echoed comments made by Tunisia's Security Minister Rafik Chelly on Friday, who said two attackers had been given weapons training at Libyan camps and had been activated from sleeper cells. In an audio message posted online Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The message said the group had targeted ""crusaders and apostates"" with ""automatic weapons and hand grenades"" in bloodshed that was ""just the start."" CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. An uncle of suspect Yassine Labidi, Abeld Malik Labidi, told CNN on Friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew. He said Yassine Labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum. ""It's true that Yassine carried out this terrorist attack, he was killed; his head, his body, we don't have it back,"" he said. But, he said, he believed Yassine and other young Tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money, organized the logistics and took them to places like Syria and Libya to train as fighters. Laura Smith-Spark and Claudia Morales contributed to this report.

The rainbow caves are given their various colours by light refracting through the ice - with the thicker the ice, the more emerald they appear. And a photographer, from Kamchatka, in the Russian Far East, also decided to add his own take - by lighting flares and breathing fire to turn the normally blue hues into dark reds.

"Bafetimbi Gomis may not score often in the Premier League, but his goals tend to leave a lasting impression. They come late, they decide matches, and they present the opposition with questions to ponder. Gomis, playing his second match since collapsing at White Hart Lane, struck three minutes from time at Villa Park to prick the bubble blown by Tim Sherwood. This was the second time in his short tenure Aston Villa have lost at home to a goal in the closing stages. It keeps Villa within the pull of the relegation zone when it had looked, after consecutive wins and reaching Wembley, an upward trajectory was gathering. For Gomis, it was a third goal of the Premier League campaign. His first came 12 minutes from time to beat Arsenal in November, bringing scrutiny on Arsene Wenger. Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) slides home a late winner to give Swansea City a 1-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon . Gomis (centre) wheels away in celebration after netting his late goal while the Villa players look crestfallen . Gomis's strike was only his second of the season for the Swans - and his first away from home for the club . The France international (centre) runs straight towards the travelling Swansea fans - where he is mobbed by one .

His second felled Manchester United in the 73rd minute of their February encounter, casting doubt on the Louis Van Gaal philosophy. This strike, while leaving Sherwood perplexed, helped suggest there is life after Wilfried Bony for Swansea. The limelight has switched to Gomis since Bony left for Manchester City with £28million going the other way. At times he has struggled to escape the shadow cast by his predecessor. Grave concerns were raised when he lay motionless against Tottenham three weeks ago, before it emerged he has a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and fainting episodes. On Saturday, he missed three good chances. But he kept going and rounded off a lovely goal with a predatory finish. Wayne Routledge danced into space in the middle of the pitch and released Jefferson Montero with a cultured pass. The rapid winger, on as a substitute, hit top gear to race past Leandro Bacuna and crossed with the outside of his right boot. Despite being tugged back by Ciaran Clark, Gomis connected

"Great Britain may be perennial underachievers in world tennis but when it comes to the sport's premier team competition Wimbledon's host nation continues to punch over its weight. In the city of his birth an emotional Andy Murray carried his side into the last eight of the World Group knockout by fending off a ferocious challenge from American giant John Isner to secure a 3-2 victory. To the deafening acclaim of Glasgow's Emirates Arena the former SW19 champion survived a tough opening set to win 7-6 6-3 7-6 against the world number 20 to wrap up the tie with his second point. Andy Murray celebrates extravagantly after winning the first set on a tie break to leave Great Britain just two sets from the quarter-finals . The British No 1 was spurred on by the Glasgow crowd to secure a 3-1 win over the USA and book a quarter-final against France . Murray is forced to stretch to reach a backhand as John Isner put in a much better performance on Sunday in the Davis Cup . Against one of the best servers ever seen in tennis Murray's coolness in the tiebreaks was the key, as was his ability to save seven break points in the opening set. 'It was a great win for the team, everyone played their part,' said Murray. 'Togetherness was a key, everyone was pulling in the same direction. 'I managed to find a way through the first set. I was over complicating my service games at first and he was going for broke on the first point of every rally. The huge American showed aggression in a first set where he forced seven break points on the Murray serve, but couldn't take any of them . Murray was well supported by a partisan Glasgow crowd as he sought to book Great Britain's place in the Davis Cup quarter finals . Isner plays a forehand on the run as the USA's top player started fast in a game his country needed to win to stay alive in the match . Murray was not at his best early on, but rallied to take the first set on a tie break after saving three set points . GB are through to the elite World Group quarter finals for the second year in succession and now face a home tie against France – 3-0 winners over Germany - immediately after Wimbledon in July. If on grass it is likely to be held somewhere like Eastbourne or Nottingham, but if they opted for an indoor court it would likely come back to Scotland, as the fans here have been outstanding in this match. 'If everyone plays to their abilities we have the chance to win more matches. We don't have huge margin for error but if Wardy (James Ward) plays like this we have a chance, although France have huge strength in depth.' This match turned out to be remarkably similar to last year's World Group first round against the same opponents: Ward upset the American number one on the first day,

"A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (£690,000). The 56-page book bought in Cambridge contains Turing's thoughts on the clearly tricky 'Leibniz notation dx/dy'. 'I find [it] extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once!' he wrote. Scroll down for video . A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (£690,000). Above, he wrote that the Leibniz notation was 'extremely difficult' It was written at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and paved the way for computer science. It is believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript known to exist, the auctioneer said. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said: 'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' In a statement through Bonhams, Turing scholar Andrew Hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how Turing 'remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' He added: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value.' Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952. He agreed to undergo hormone treatment

"Being underweight in mid-life could increase your risk of dementia, claim researchers. A new study shows you are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as Alzheimer's than those of a healthy weight. Obese people appear to be protected against dementia, with a risk around 30 per cent lower than those of healthy weight. The findings contradict many previous studies which have suggested that being fat – with a high Body Mass Index (BMI) - could raise the risk. A new study shows underweight people are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as Alzheimer's than those of a healthy weight (file photo) Study author, Professor Stuart Pocock, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said doctors and policymakers may have to re-think how to best identify those at high risk of dementia. He said 'We also need to pay attention to the causes and public health consequences of the link between underweight and increased dementia risk which our research has established.' 'However, our results also open up an intriguing new avenue in the search for protective factors for dementia - if we can understand why people with a high BMI have a reduced risk of dementia, it's possible that further down the line, researchers might be able to use these insights to develop new treatments for dementia.' Other experts said more research was needed, and the way GPs used to diagnose dementia may have skewed the results. Researchers based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Oxon Epidemiology, also in London, analysed patient information recorded during routine general practice over nearly two decades. Data on 1,958,191 patients aged 55 on average with a BMI of 26.5 on average - just within the range usually classed as overweight - were examined. BMI is assessed by comparing height to weight, in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared. A healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 – above is overweight and obese. The study regarded BMI of less than 20 as underweight. After nine years follow-up, 45,507 people were diagnosed with dementia. Researchers found people who were underweight in middle age were 34 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those of a healthy weight. The findings contradict many previous studies which have suggested that being fat – with a high Body Mass Index (BMI) - could raise the risk (file photo) As people's BMI increased, the risk of dementia fell, with very obese people having a BMI greater than 40 less likely to develop the condition than those of normal weight. The link was not affected by the decade in which patients were born, age at diagnosis, alcohol use or smoking. The new research was published in The Lancet Diabetes And Endocrinology journal (must credit). Dr Nawab Qizilbash, from Oxon Epidemiology in London, said the reasons why high BMI might lead to a lower risk of dementia are not clear.

"Oh be still my beating heart. Here we are, standing on the gravel outside the library doors at Highclere Castle, the English stately home in Hampshire that provides the ravishing setting for the television series, Downton Abbey. We are on the very spot where Matthew Crawley asked Lady Mary to marry him in the first Downton Abbey Christmas special, broadcast in 2011. Remember when the violins soared and snowflakes fell? When Matthew got down on one miraculously recovered knee to propose? For many viewers, this was their all-time favourite Downton scene. Scroll down for video . To the manor married: Lady Carnarvon, the real-life equivalent of Downton Abbey’s Cora, in front of Highclere . ‘Well, that wasn’t my favourite scene!’ cries the Countess of Carnarvon, the current chatelaine of Highclere and the real-life equivalent of Downton’s Cora, who’s Countess of Grantham. ‘The crew were using ash to recreate the snow. It got inside the house and we had to spend ages dusting and cleaning the rooms. And the smell! Very acrid. We reached the point where we had to stop them doing it.’ Lady Carnarvon has always been quite frank about the travails of letting a film crew loose inside her beautiful home. On the plus side, there are the location fees and increased visitor traffic; the crowds paying £20 a head to goggle at the splendour of her Highclere interiors and the red velvet sofas where the Crawleys gather to take tea. ‘Yes. It’s like that show, Poke Your Nose Through The Keyhole,’ she says. On the downside, damage and disruption. ‘I do get annoyed when visitors chuck litter about, but my husband goes around picking it up. We fill black bags with the stuff.’ And since the very first day of Downton filming, when a technician smashed a much-loved green objet de vertu trinket box, she has been on red alert for transgressions. When she is not telling the crew that she pops open the champagne the minute they leave, she is issuing instructions on the correct way to move precious antique furniture. ‘You lift a girl in your arms and a chair by its bottom,’ she will say. As Carson the butler (‘Oh, I adore him, he is divine’) would no doubt agree, the problem with having high standards is that so few manage to live up to them. Another who has incurred her displeasure is Ralph Lauren. The wealthy American designer and his family recently attended a swanky dinner at Highclere, hosted by the Earl and Countess. The Laurens committed the social faux pas of taking numerous photographs of themselves grinning cheesily on the famous Oak Staircase, and elsewhere in sumptuous Highclere, then proudly posting the snaps online. Her ladyship was not best pleased. ‘My interpretation of dinner is having a meal and his interpretation is taking photographs. It seemed to get out of hand. I have to live with that.’ Has she seen the pictures? ‘No and I don’t want to, because I don’t want to be irritated by them. My idea of a nice evening is

"Fernando Alonso is convinced success is on the horizon for McLaren on the day when he saw former team Ferrari return to glory. After missing the season-opening Australian Grand Prix as he recovered from a concussion sustained in a test crash, Alonso's first outing on his return to the team ended in retirement after 21 laps of the Malaysian Grand Prix due to an ERS cooling issue. As Alonso spoke and delivered his verdict on the weekend when McLaren have at least made some progress, Sebastian Vettel was charging around in the background en route to his first win for 16 months. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso is all smiles in Malaysia despite not finishing the Grand Prix on Sunday . Alonso's McLaren is wheeled into the garage after he was forced to retire from the Malaysian Grand Prix . The German is, of course, Alonso's replacement at Ferrari as the 33-year-old opted to quit the Maranallo marque after five years without success of trying to claim a third title. What must Alonso have thought later when he saw Vettel stand on the top step of the podium, the first time a Ferrari driver had done so since the Spaniard himself in his home grand prix two years ago. Whatever Alonso's thoughts, all he can do now is remain convinced McLaren's early woes in conjunction with new power-unit supplier Honda will ultimately lead to the results he craves. It is a case of short-term pain for long-term gain as Alonso said: 'These reliability problems are normal. The Spaniard failed to finish the race on Sunday, managing just 21 laps at the Malaysian Grand Prix . 'What you normally find in winter testing, we have to find in the first couple of races unfortunately. We need to accept maybe some retirements and we are ready to do so. 'Definitely it has been a very nice weekend and a very nice surprise to see the improvements from Australia to here. 'If we keep up this rate then we will enjoy success very soon.' Overall, Alonso expressed 'mixed feelings' as to how the weekend had unfolded, adding: 'I'm happy to be back and very happy with the progress the team has made. Both McLaren's failed to finish the race in Malaysia as they continue to struggle for form this F1 season . 'Watching the race on the TV in Australia, we were very far off - four seconds in the race and just one McLaren running alone at the back. 'Here we were much more competitive in qualifying, running with everyone in the race, which was a very nice surprise. 'But not finishing the race is never a nice feeling, so let's see if we can improve next time.'

"A family has been left devastated after their pet cat was put down without their consent by a vet who thought it was a stray. Julie Neeson was worried when the cat, who was called Babies, didn't come home after being let out in Newtownabbey, Co Antrim. She went looking for the animal with daughters Tia, 13 and Kiana, 10, but a worried passer-by had already taken him to a local vets. Devastated: Kiana Neeson, 10, and her family were left devastated when their pet cat Babies was put down without their consent or knowledge. Vets presumed the animal was a stray when it was handed in without a collar or microchip . Tia and Kiana (pictured with their other cats) wrote a letter to Babies after discovering he had been put down . With no microchip and his collar already removed by the time he was brought in staff presumed Babies was a stray and gave him a lethal injection after detecting signs of illness.

"(CNN)On the eve of the one-year mark since nearly 300 schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria, Malala Yousafzai released an ""open letter"" to the girls Monday. ""Like you, I was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school,"" she writes in the letter. The 17-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner survived an attack by the Taliban, which had singled her out for blogging from Pakistan about the importance of staying in school. In the letter, she calls on the Nigerian government and the international community to do more to rescue the girls. Nigeria recently held an election. On April 14, 2014, Islamists with Boko Haram kidnapped the girls, prompting an international campaign for their safe return, which used the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. On Monday, UNICEF announced a new campaign for the 800,000 children who have been displaced in northeast Nigeria, using the hashtag #BringBackOurChildhood. Malala is admired globally as a figure standing for peace. On Sunday, a NASA astrophysicist named an asteroid after her. She has spoken with CNN about the Nigerian abductions previously. Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . Here is the full letter: . To my brave sisters, the kidnapped schoolgirls of Chibok, . On this first anniversary of your captivity, I write to you with a message of solidarity, love and hope. My name is Malala. I am a Pakistani girl your age. I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers. We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you. We will always stand with you. Today and every day, we call on the Nigerian authorities and the international community to do more to bring you home. We will not rest until you have been reunited with your families. Like you, I was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school. Gunmen shot me and two of my friends on a school bus. All three of us survived and are back in school. Now we speak out on behalf of all girls about the right to get a proper education. Our campaign will continue until you and all girls and boys around the world are able to access a free, safe and quality secondary education. Last July, I spent my 17th birthday in Nigeria with some of your parents and five of your classmates who escaped the kidnapping. Your parents are grief-stricken. They love you, and they miss you. My father and I wept and prayed with your parents -- and they touched our hearts. The escapee schoolgirls my father and I met impressed us with their resolve to overcome their challenges and to complete their high school education. My father and I promised your parents and the girls who had escaped that we would do all we could to help them. I met Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and urged him to work harder for your freedom. I also

"In telly terms, the FA Cup has had quite - what they like to call in the trade - a 'journey’ this season. This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene. This no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC’s on-site studio. ‘I don’t like semi finals at Wembley’, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it. Well, some twenty four hour or so later, Wembley was certainly delighted to host them. Arsenal players celebrate during the victory over Reading which saw the Gunners reach the FA Cup final . Fabian Delph (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Liverpool at Wembley . Wembley Stadium was a great setting for this weekend's two FA Cup semi-final clashes . Prior to that first clash on Saturday between Arsenal and Reading, there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the Emirates Stadium. This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as ‘difficult to watch’. If you weren’t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion. Alongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn’t treat their premature trip to north west London as ‘a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal. Well, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement. Reading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday . What’s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories. ‘It’s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn’t it Wrighty?’, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. ‘Don’t start again, Gary!’, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros. And then there was Reading’s Adam Federici. I was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups, and while doing

"When Jose Mourinho returned to English football in 2013, he produced a pair of spectacles from his pocket to claim it was the only thing that had changed in six years away from Chelsea. This time Mourinho has read the small print, carrying out Roman Abramovich’s vision for his club to be self-financing and operating within UEFA’s strict Financial Fair Play guidelines. They were rather more gung-ho in 2004, spraying money around Europe to sign some of the best talent in the game to make sure Chelsea cleaned up in Mourinho’s first three seasons at Stamford Bridge. From July 1, 2004 to July 20, 2004, Abramovich splashed £89million on seven players — including Petr Cech, Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba — in a whirlwind shopping spree. They finished the season with the title. Jose Mourinho won his first trophy since returning to England when Chelsea beat Tottenham on Sunday . The Portuguese manager has reduced spending at the club but has continued to bring success . Players like Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have been brought to the club and proved a huge success . On Sunday evening, less than half an hour after John Terry had lifted the Capital One Cup, Chelsea’s manager claimed the club are now operating in the ‘third tier’ of clubs. Financial Fair Play has become something of a hobby horse of Mourinho in recent months. He highlights the money-no-object strategies of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain while emphasising how Chelsea are working within strict, fiscal parameters. ‘There are teams who don’t care about FFP and are punished, but they play,’ he added. ‘Then there is a group, which Chelsea are in, the group who care about FFP.’ Last week, City manager Manuel Pellegrini did not have the confidence to start Eliaquim Mangala, who cost £32m last summer, alongside captain Vincent Kompany against Barcelona. After Chelsea collected the Capital One Cup, a trophy City won last season, Mourinho referred to £11m signing Kurt Zouma, 20, as his ‘Marcel Desailly’ after a mature performance alongside Ramires in midfield. Whichever way you look at it, the numbers add up for Mourinho as he turns his attention to winning his third Premier League title. Chelsea sold defender David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain for a staggering £50million last summer . Juan Mata was a star player for Chelsea but when Mourinho arrived he sold him to Manchester United . Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku was sold to Everton for £28m, giving Chelsea a considerable profit . The average age of his Chelsea team at Wembley on Sunday was 27 years and three months compared to the 28 of City, beaten 2-1 by Liverpool at Anfield earlier in the day. And Mourinho’s squad looks the better long-term bet. Once a player has worn that blue shirt, there is an automatic premium, as Mourinho has used to great effect, whenever he decides to move them on. They made a profit of about £18m on Romelu Lukaku, who made just 10 Premier League appearances for Chelsea, when he was sold to Everton before the start

"Christian Eriksen is set to become the youngest Dane to win 50 caps after he was named in the squad by manager Morten Olsen on Tuesday ahead of friendlies against the United States and France. The 23-year-old Tottenham midfielder should reach the 50 international milestone at a younger age than previous record holder Michael Laudrup. The Spurs playmaker made his debut in March 2010, becoming the youngest Dane to play for the national side since Michael Laudrup and the fourth youngest ever. Christian Eriksen is set to become the youngest player to earn 50 international caps for Denmark . Eriksen has currently played for the national side 49 times since making his debut in March 2010 . During his 49 caps so far Eriksen has only scored one competitive goal with his other four strikes coming in friendlies, and the former Ajax man has often been criticised for his performance for Denmark. Captain Daniel Agger, defender Lars Jacobsen and midfielder William Kvist were named in the squad despite having been involved in a bitter dispute with the Danish FA (DBU) over a collective bargaining agreement. Negotiations to resolve the dispute, which concerns payments and bonuses to men's, women's and Under-21 international teams, are ongoing, the DBU said.

"He joined The Daily Show as a correspondent only three months ago. But now, Trevor Noah has reportedly emerged as the frontrunner to replace host Jon Stewart. The 31-year-old South African comedian has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the Comedy Central show this year. He is being considered for an integral position on the program, a source close to the matter told Variety magazine. However, no final decision has yet been reached by network executives. Scroll down for video . Replacement? Trevor Noah (left) joined The Daily Show as a correspondent three months ago. But now, he has reportedly emerged as the frontrunner to replace the Comedy Central program's host Jon Stewart (right) 'Shortlisted': The 31-year-old South African comedian (pictured in 2012) has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the show this year . According to the source, Comedy Central's efforts to select a replacement for Stewart - who has hosted the satirical news show for a staggering 16 years - have gained speed in recent days. Last month, shortly after Stewart revealed his plans to step down from his role, company executive Doug Herzog confirmed that a 'short list' of possible replacements had already been put together. He added that the channel and Stewart were consulting on when he will depart his job, as well as discussing whether he will have continue to have a role with the show he has hosted since 1999. When asked about a possible future role, Herzog, 55, the president of Viacom Entertainment Group, replied 'TBD', meaning 'to be determined'. He then added: 'It's not out of the question.' If Noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on-air - replaces Stewart on The Daily Show this year, he will be joining a primarily white, male and straight late night show landscape. At present, Comedy Central is the only network to have an African-American host: Larry Wilmore, A network spokesman declined to tell Variety whether Noah was being considered for Stewart's job. No stranger to controversy: During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, Noah (pictured during the broadcast) used his mixed-race heritage and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests in the US over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart that his arms were 'tired' from constantly 'holding them up' Thorny issues: 'I never thought I'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa,' he said, adding: 'It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days back home.' He also riffed on Ebola with Stewart . Noah, who grew up in Gauteng, started his entertainment career at 18 on the South African soap opera, Isidingo. He shortly began hosting his own radio show on the region's main youth station. Now, he is a well-known TV personality in the country, with his stand-up shows often selling out.

"A father of a 12-year-old girl who he married off in an Islamic ceremony told his daughter told his daughter not to take the contractive pill because it 'causes breast cancer'. The father, who cannot be named legally, is on trial at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court charged with procuring a child for unlawful sexual activity and with being an accessory before the fact of sexual intercourse with a child. He took the stand at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court today and recounted the day of the Islamic wedding ceremony at his Hunter Valley home between his child and a 26-year-old Lebanese national on January 12 last year, according to the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . A 27-year-old man (pictured) has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years behind bars for marrying and sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl. Now her father is on trial for agreeing to the arrangement because he discovered that his daughter was' menstruating and interested in boys' a court heard . The man admitted to the court he told his daughter not to take the pill so 'she didn't get breast cancer', and said he had heard about its dangers through the McGrath Foundation. “I say it all the time,” he said. Earlier this week the court heard the father told his daughter Australian laws forbidding her from marrying were 'stupid'. The girl told a Sydney court her father said Australian law was 'stupid' and girls her age should be allowed to get married and have sexual intercourse. The girl's interview with a child protection worker was played as part of her father's trial. She said days after her wedding, her father began to panic that her husband might be jailed. 'He was upset because we might be in trouble,' the girl said. '(My father) knows no marriage under the age of 16. 'Because he says to me the law here is stupid, girls your age should be allowed to get married and have intercourse. 'He said we didn't do anything wrong, we were just following religion.' Her father said her husband, now 27, 'shouldn't be put away', and that they were 'just following religion'. The girl, now 14, said in her father's religion, marriage was allowed once the girl got her period and having sex before marriage was punishable by stoning or death in Islamic countries. '(Premarital sex) is actually one of the worst things you can do,' she said. The court also heard the girl and her husband had sex 'once or twice' a day after they were married. They also spent five nights staying at her father's house. The girl also detailed the motivation for the marriage being organised, which was her reaching puberty. In the video interview shown to the court, she said she understood puberty to be 'blood...when I got my period'. She also said her father told her not to take birth control pills, and that her father reminded her not to let her husband wear a condom. 'Don't use pills or condoms - don't

"(CNN)James Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering ""a psychotic episode"" at the time, according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence ""revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012,"" the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as ""four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine."" The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges.

"For Dave King, the battle for control of Rangers is all but over. The resignation of Ibrox chairman David Somers on Monday morning brought confirmation that the end of days has arrived for this reviled current plc board. Yet, the hard work starts here as King and his backers try to revive an institution that has been more akin to a circus than a football club in the chaotic last three years since administration, then liquidation, visited Govan. Here, Sportsmail looks at the tasks that will be taking priority in King’s packed in-tray as he embarks on a rebuilding job that he and his team believe could take up to five years. Dave King is set to take control of Rangers after chairman Dave Somers resigned from post on Monday . 1. Appoint a new executive team . With the repayment of Mike Ashley’s £5million loan, and running costs of upwards of £25m over the next two years, Rangers need a top-class executive team in place as quickly as possible to map out the club’s financial future. After Friday’s extraordinary general meeting, King will install his allies Paul Murray and John Gilligan as directors. The two remaining current plc directors, Derek Llambias, Rangers’ chief executive, and Barry Leach, director of finance, are not expected to tender their resignations. But King’s first move is expected to be to sack and replace them — whatever the cost. Not surprisingly to those following this rapacious Rangers saga, Llambias and Leach have both just been awarded bumper contracts, complete with lengthy notice periods. 2. Appoint a manager . Kenny McDowall tendered his resignation in January and the uncomfortable-looking 51-year-old keeps making it plain he does not want to be the manager of Rangers a minute longer than he absolutely has to. Under his management, performances have been poor with Rangers winning just two of their last six games. But it would take a collapse of monumental proportions for the Ibrox side to be overtaken by Falkirk and Queen of the South for a place in the play-offs. Stuart McCall is being viewed as the favourite for the post, while fans would love to see King bring back Walter Smith, even in a short-term capacity. But whoever the new manager is, the speedier the appointment, the more time he would have to set his players up for a push at promotion. What is unarguable is this: the new man needs to coax better performances than managed by Ally McCoist and McDowall if Rangers are to overcome a Hibs side that has swatted them aside with ease in the Championship this season. Interim Rangers manager Kenny McDowall does not want the job a minute longer than he has to . 3. Player recruitment . There are 12 Rangers first-team players out of contract in the summer. Captain Lee McCulloch, plus Kris Boyd, Kenny Miller, Jon Daly, Bilel Mohsni, Darren McGregor, Richard Foster, Steven Smith, Sebastien Faure, Ian Black, Kyle Hutton and Steve Simonsen all see their deals run out on June 1, 2015.

"A new species of mushroom that looks like a man has been discovered by the side of a road. The fungus, found in Cockley Cley, Norfolk, has fleshy off-shoots that appear to resemble human heads, arms and legs. The discovery was made by Jonathan Revett and the mushroom has now been classified as a new species in the world. Fun guys: A new species of mushroom that looks like a man has been discovered by the side of a busy road . They have been named as geastrum britannicum to reflect them being unique to the UK. Mr Revett, 49, said: 'They do look like little mushroom men. 'It's really strange how their shape makes them look like they have a head and arms. That's what drew my attention to them.' Despite first spotting them in 2000, the fungus was dismissed as a species of earthstar fungi which is prevalent in Norfolk. Having been interested in mycology - the study of fungus - for more than 40 years, Mr Revett sent them off to Kew Gardens for testing. The fungus, found in Cockley Cley, Norfolk, has fleshy off-shoots that appear to resemble human heads, arms and legs . However, 15 years later, mycologists in Spain carried out DNA sequence analysis and have just confirmed they differ slightly. Mr Revett - who runs the mycology website fenfungi.com - said: 'It felt brilliant knowing I'd found something new. 'I wouldn't normally question the experts but I just knew these were different. 'I go back to the site every year doing tours and they're always there. Since Mr Revett's original find, three more specimens have been collected in Norfolk and the fungus has also been found in Hampshire and the Welsh Borders . 'It's incredible to think I'd only gone out there to look at some big mushrooms I'd been tipped off about.' Since Mr Revett's original find, three more specimens have been collected in Norfolk and the fungus has also been found in Hampshire and the Welsh Borders. Carl Chapman, of Norfolk-based Wildlife Tours and Education, said: 'This is riveting stuff. This is not just a new species for Norfolk - this is a new species for the world. 'They were doing the work and requested some samples of this fungus and found the DNA was different.'

"Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine. Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. ""My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,"" Klitschko told CNN. ""I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting."" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. ""People are dying in Ukraine every single day,"" Klitschko said. ""I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen."" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. ""I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,"" he said. ""Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want. ""If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and

"Ronny Deila is preparing for the William Hill Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness, believing Celtic themselves provide the biggest hurdle to their treble hopes. The Scottish League Cup winners are eight points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Scottish Premiership with six games remaining and strong favourites to make it four in a row. Asked ahead of the trip to Hampden Park on Sunday if he felt he had a treble-winning squad at his disposal, the Norwegian boss said: . Ronny Deila is preparing his Celtic side for Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness . As they ready themselves for the trip to Hampden Park, Celtic will be focused on treble hopes . 'We will see but I really believe that we can do it and now it is up to us. 'If we are performing well, we know that we are very hard to beat. 'We have shown that for a long, long time now and again, our biggest opponent is ourselves. 'We need to keep our mind on the right things. 'I have felt a sense of excitement for a long time. But it is very important to focus on the next training session and next game, instead of thinking of what might be, thinking of what we have to do to make it as good as possible now.' Deila believes treble success will help not only attract players to the club this summer, but also help keep those who are already at Parkhead and perhaps thinking of moving to pastures new. The former Stromsgodset boss said: 'The players are happy, they enjoy being in Glasgow and at Celtic and if they see the team is going forward they want to stay, that is my experience. The Scottish League Cup winners are eight points clear in Scottish Premiership with six games to play . 'It's my job to make the staff and players feel well and have fun and looking forward to coming to work. 'It is not like that everywhere. I've had players come to me who are very unhappy and then money is nothing, in my opinion.' The day after Wednesday night's 4-1 home win over Kilmarnock, Deila travelled south to see Celtic's development team lose on penalties to Manchester City in the quarter-final of the Premier League International Cup. After their early Champions League exit, Celtic fans could be celebrating a treble-winning season soon . Out of favour striker Stefan Scepovic, who was signed from Sporting Gijon for a reported fee of £2.3million in September, was given some game time and Deila, who has Anthony Stokes suspended and Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong cup-tied for the Caley game, revealed the 25-year-old Serbia international will be in his plans for Hampden. He said: 'Scepovic is in the squad for Sunday. He needed a game instead of sitting on the bench on Wednesday. 'His contribution is going up and down. There is competition, it's tough to switch around when you have other strikers doing well. 'But he has some qualities that the others don't have and he's

"A new video shows LA police officers dragging a homeless man from his tent just moments before they shot him dead in a street confrontation on the city's Skid Row. This latest video shows the man - who is thought to have been called Booth, but is known locally as 'Africa' and 'Cameroon' in reference to his African heritage - disappearing into his tent after apparently speaking to police. But officers swoop down on the man and drag him from his tent, which appears to collapse. A violent altercation ensues before five officers manage to pin him down - and then three officers open fire, killing the man. The CCTV, shot from the local homeless shelter, has shed yet more light on the violent midday confrontation which has left many shocked after an initial video appeared on social media on Sunday. Conversation: The homeless shelter's CCTV footage shows the man apparently talk to officers . Hiding?: The man then gets into his tent - but the officers appear to be trying to get him out . Increase: More officers arrive and begin to try to drag the man - who was known as 'Africa' - from the tent . Shot dead: A violent altercation ensued and the homeless man, circled in red, was gunned down by officers . The first footage released of the incident showed the man flailing at officers before being pinned to the floor. They try to use a Taser on him - but it seemingly has no effect. Shouts of 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' can be heard seconds before three officers open fire on the prone man. Outraged crowds soon gathered at the scene, accusing the police of unjustly killing him. Witnesses have characterised the police response as overly aggressive, and say they should have been able to restrain a mentally-ill homeless man with non-lethal means. Pressure for the LAPD to produce evidence to vindicate their officers has been mounting ever since the video was released. A police statement on the killing said that 'the suspect and officers struggled over one of the officer's handguns' before shots were fired - a statement the LAPD say is backed up by onlooker footage. But officials claim a frame from an onlooker's video shows the man grabbing at an officer's waistband, while a close-up of the weapon in question apparently shows damage caused by the scuffle. LAPD officials say the man was wanted in connection with a robbery, and started brawling with officers who approached him. Collapse: The video appears to show the tent collapse as the man emerges from his hiding place . Fight: The CCTV then captures the altercation which ended in the man's death at the hands of officers . Police chief Charlie Beck has called Sunday's killing an 'extreme tragedy' - and implored anybody with video evidence to submit it to police. He has also revealed two of the officers were wearing body-mounted cameras. His statement came as more information emerged about the drifter, whom friends say came from Cameroon and lived in the U.S.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely formal, yet troubling scene. A room in a far flung corner of Afghanistan where a serious lecture is happening, to an audience that seems part ideological, part curious; some are just impoverished, hoping for a quick job. At the front of this room stands an Afghan freshly back from fighting in Syria, and intent on recruiting other Afghans to fight alongside him for ISIS. ""Brothers, I am here to tell you"", the recruiter begins, ""about the mujahideen in Syria."" All faces are hidden in the footage, yet the motivations are clear. This seems to be part of ISIS's first moves into Afghanistan, a bid to bolster their ranks for the fight in Iraq and Syria by vacuuming up disgruntled former Taliban fighters -- or even just students looking for a cause. But it's a troubling move nonetheless. There's no shortage of battle-hardened militants here. And as NATO leaves, the Taliban looks strong if a little fractured -- and the possibility of peace talks ahead with the Afghan government could alienate some of the group's more radical elements. The man is one of five recruiters, he says -- some foreign, others Afghan like him, spread out across the country. His message is broadly ideological. ""Jihad is now obligatory not only in Afghanistan, but also in many other places in the world,"" the recruiter tells the room. ""The Christians and Jews have not only attacked Afghanistan, but they have also attacked Muslims in Syria, Iraq and Palestine. So Jihad is obligatory on us in these places."" His reception is mixed, but to one audience member the ideological appeal is clear. ""My aim is to fight infidels,"" the man says. ""In Syria, or if they ask me to in Afghanistan, I will."" Another man says he would prefer to stay home and go to university, but he is attracted by the recruiter's offer of money. ""I definitely need the money,"" he says, ""but will stay here and hope peace comes."" Concerns are growing about how ISIS may expand into Afghanistan. When asked why ISIS might be on the rise here, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: ""The reason it's happening is because (the) collapse of Yemen, Syria, Iraq has created an environment where instead of one weak link in the interrelated system of states, now there are wider spaces."" Ghani added: ""They have -- it's one of the most well-endowed finance -- well-financed organizations. And the techniques are spreading."" The United Nations Special Representative to Afghanistan, Nicholas Haysom, told the Security Council that ISIS's presence in Afghanistan was ""of concern,"" but was most troubling in its ""potential to offer an alternative flagpole to which otherwise isolated insurgent splinter groups can rally."" A senior U.S. official told CNN that ""the terrain is there"" for ISIS to grow in Afghanistan. This is ""something everyone is keeping a very close eye on. Afghanistan government is concerned. Pakistan government is concerned,"" he said, before adding that disaffected Taliban might also be attracted to the group. The path to CNN's filming with

"The 18-year-old student who was filmed biting the head off a live hamster has been expelled from his fraternity, withdrawn from college and submitted for mental assessment. DailyMail.com last weekend exposed Brady Eaves, the privately-educated stepson of a former Mississippi governor candidate, as the teenager who shrieked with laughter as he murdered the small animal in a video from a drunken Spring Break party. The footage, allegedly filmed in Florida, could see Eaves charged with felony animal cruelty charges, which carry a maximum jail term of five years and $5,000 in fines. In a statement branding his actions 'disturbing' and 'disappointing', Eaves' stepfather and mother revealed he has been withdrawn from the University of Mississippi, where he was on a scholarship, and submitted for mental health tests. It comes after Phi Delta Theta openly condemned Eaves' actions and expelled him from the fraternity.

'The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character.' They added: 'As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again.' Sources close to Eaves told DailyMail.com he was top of his class at private Jackson Preparatory School, and described him as an 'animal lover' whose numerous pets include a raccoon and a parrot.

"Hillary Clinton imposed a blanket of secrecy on her movements at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and told aides they would be fired if she was seen, it is claimed. Mrs Clinton said that she wanted nobody to know when she was going to the pool apart from one usher who was to guide her there. There she would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking ‘heartbroken’, according to a new book. A new book has claimed that Hillary Clinton imposed a blanket of secrecy on her movements during the Monica Lewinsky scandal . The vivid account is written by Kate Andersen Brower, a former White House correspondent for Bloomberg News in ‘The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.’ She tells how in the summer of 1998, a few days before Mr Clinton would admit to sex with former White House intern Miss Lewinsky, usher Worthington White was approached by Mrs Clinton. She told him that she wanted to go to the pool but that only he could see her - no other aides and no Secret Service. Mr White said that he told Mrs Clinton’s lead Secret Service agent: ‘If anybody sees her, or she sees anybody, I’m going to get fired, I know it. And you probably will too’. By the pool Mrs Clinton would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking ‘heartbroken, it is claimed . Mrs Clinton’s wish was granted and she took an elevator to the pool, spent the afternoon there and came back the same way, . Miss Brower writes that Mrs Clinton ‘turned to White, took his hands and squeezed them, looked him in the eye, and thanked him.’ The book also recounts how the Clintons did not trust the old fashioned White House telephone system and felt too many people could listen in - so had it completely rewired . Miss Brower writes: ‘They had all the White House phones changed over to interior circuitry so that if the first lady was in the bedroom and the president was in the study, she could ring him from room to room without going through the operator’. Such upheaval did not go down well with staff and according to James W.F. ‘Skip’ Allen, an usher from 1979 to 2004, the Clintons were ‘about the most paranoid people I’d ever seen in my life’. The disclosure sheds new light on the row over Mrs Clinton’s use of a private email account and her own personal server whilst Secretary of State. It could harm her chances in the race for the Presidency in 2016 - she is expected to announce her candidacy this month. A new poll has found that Mrs Clinton’s approval ratings have slipped since the scandal broke and she is two points behind former Florida governor Jeb Bush, her likely opponent. Bill Clinton admitted in the summer of 1998 that he was having sex with former White House intern Miss Lewinsky (pictured)

"Christopher Dearlove coughed over nurses telling them he had Ebola to try to get a hospital bed . Britain's most prolific 'hospital hopper' has been jailed after shutting down an A&E department by pretending to have Ebola. Homeless Christopher Dearlove, 59, was banned from entering any NHS building unless he had a genuine medical problem in 2010 after making up ailments to get a free bed for the night. But earlier this year he forced Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby into lock-down after telling nurses he had Ebola, coughing over them and demanding treatment. He was jailed at Grimsby Crown Court for 14 months. Dearlove, who is an alcoholic, had been drinking for almost four hours when he walked into the Grimsby A&E in February. The man, who is thought to be homeless, told nurses he had recently returned from West Africa where his wife had died of the disease. He claimed he had tested positive for Ebola at Johannesburg airport before coughing over staff. Using a false name, he was then heard saying: 'It’s not my fault if everyone becomes infected.' Part of the A&E was forced into lock-down as nurses rushed into protective clothing. He was arrested after a member of staff recognised him and phoned the police. It is not thought Dearlove received any testing or treatment at the hospital. Sentencing, Judge David Tremberg said: 'You gave hard pressed medical services more cause for concern and work. 'They should not be diverted from genuinely sick and injured patients and not be indulging in your fantasies. 'Claiming Ebola and coughing on people is a particularly unpleasant and unattractive act.' Part of Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby was forced to close as a result of the stunt in February . In carrying out the stunt Dearlove broke an anti-social behaviour order issued in 2010 which banned him from visiting hospitals unless genuinely ill. It was imposed after he told nurses at various facilities that he was a haemophiliac with AIDS and coughed up fake blood to get a room. On separate occasions he claimed to have been experiencing weight loss, night sweats and pain in his chest in order to be admitted. From 2006 the NHS began distributing images of the fraudster to stop A&E departments across the country from admitting him. The alcoholic would give a false name and medical history and list symptoms he knew were likely to secure him an isolated room. Each of his stints cost between £400 and £1,000 according to the NHS security management service. Every time he was admitted. Defending at Grimsby Crown Court, Ernie Lidster said he had a psychiatric disorder. Dearlove was jailed for 14 months at Grimsby Crown Court (above). In court his lawyer said he had a mental disorder .

"A giant semi-fossilised egg that is almost 100 times larger than a chicken's egg and still has the tiny skeleton of a bird inside is to go on sale for more than £50,000. The rare egg, which is 12 inches long and more than eight inches in diametre, belonged to the now extinct elephant bird that lived on Madagascar. The flightless birds, which stood nearly 10 feet (three metres) tall and weighted half a tonne, died out in the 17th century after heavy hunting. Scroll down for video . This 12 inch long elephant bird egg - just one of 25 known to remain intact around the world - is going on sale . There are thought to be just 25 preserved intact elephant bird eggs left in existence, with most in museums. Now one owned by a German marine biologist Professor Hubert Caspers, who worked at the Institute for Hydrobiology and Fisheries Science before his death in 1998, is to go on sale in Bruges, Belgium. Genetic material has been extracted from the shells of ancient elephant bird eggs. It has raised hopes that it may be possible to use cloning techniques to resurrect the extinct species. By injecting the genetic material into the unfertilised eggs of other large flightless birds like the ostrich, it may be possible to recreate the elephant bird. However, scientists face significant challenges that need to be overcome before this is possible. Cloning birds is considered to be particularly challenging. Extracting enough DNA from eggshells is also thought to be another limiting factor. Finally much of the habitat the the elephant birds once inhabited has now changed, so there may be few places where such a large species could now live. Scans taken of the egg, which is at least 400 years old, have also revealed the tiny bones of an embryo that had started to grow inside along with dehydrated organic material. Scientists were recently able to extract DNA from a similar egg, raising hopes that it may be possible to bring the elephant bird back to life using cloning techniques. Auctioneers Rob Michiels, who is selling the egg along with other items from Dr Caspers collection, said the egg appeared to be older than other eggs that have been sold recently. He said: 'The eggs of elephant birds are extremely rare - there are probably 25 of them in the world. 'This once comes from the collection of Dr Caspers and we have been asked to sell it by his children who thought it was a dinosaur egg. 'The children didn't know a lot about their father's collection. 'I was invited to Hamburg to look at a collection of antique tiles that he owned and I spotted the egg. It was just sat in a box. 'We have had a CT scan of the egg and it showed there is still organic, dehydrated material inside in the form of fetal bones. 'Technically, you could extract DNA from it and if you have a very large ostrich you could re-create a form of an elephant

"Around 200 skeletons have been unearthed under a Paris supermarket after workmen extending the shop's basement discovered a huge pile of bones. The bodies, which were found neatly stacked five deep in eight underground chambers, are thought to be victims of an epidemic that struck France at least five centuries ago. Archaeologists from the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) were called in to take a look and have spent days tirelessly uncovering the bones. Around 200 skeletons have been unearthed under a small Paris supermarket after workmen extending the shop's basement discovered a huge pile of bones . They found seven chambers containing around 20 skeletons each and a further chamber that had another 150. Pascal Roy, store manager of the Monoprix supermarket, said that the shop had been built on the site of the old Trinité hospital, which functioned from as early as the 12th century. He said: 'We figured there'd be a few bones there considering it used to be the site of a cemetery, but we didn't expect to find mass graves.' But other experts have said the bodies might have been placed there when more than six-million corpses were moved to the Paris Catacombs from the city's cemeteries 200 years ago . Archaeologists are slowly and delicately uncovering the skeletons and attaching numbers to them. Above are skeletons 159, 157 and 162 . The bodies are thought to be victims of an epidemic that struck France at least five centuries ago - perhaps the plague or a famine . They were neatly stacked five deep in eight underground chambers. Seven of the chambers contained 20 skeletons and one contained more than 150 . Experts called the site 'extraordinary' and said they were astonished to find so many skeletons in one place. They said: 'The fact that the skeletons were so closely packed together in a mass grave suggests that they were the victims of an epidemic like the plague, which struck France throughout the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. 'The grave provides an excellent opportunity to learn about how death was managed and how funerary practices were carried out centuries ago.' Isabelle Abadie, an archaeologist, added that it was particularly interesting because the bodies were not thrown into the graves, suggesting that they might have been placed head to toe to save space.

"Felicity Bassouls, 67, is accused of harassing former England winger Ben Cohen after he split from her daughter Abby in September last year . England rugby and Strictly star Ben Cohen is to give evidence against his mother-in-law, who is accused of bombarding him with emails and calls after he split from his wife amid rumours of an affair. Felicity Bassouls, 67, who lives in the Highlands of Scotland, is accused of harassing the former England winger after he split from her daughter Abby in September last year. The World Cup winner, 36, was facing accusations that his marriage was ended by the 'curse' of the BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing. He had starred on the 2013 programme with Kristina Rihanoff, but denied they had a relationship. On Facebook he wrote: 'It is a sad world when two adults cannot have a friendship.' Mrs Bassouls arrived at Northampton Magistrates' Court to answer a summons of two counts of harassment without violence. One is against Cohen and one her own son, Austen Blaney, between 1 September and 29 October last year. The former Northampton Saints player is the founder of The Ben Cohen StandUp Foundation, which aims to raise awareness of the long-term, damaging effects of bullying. In a statement issued at the time of the split the couple said: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children. 'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.' The couple have been married for 11 years and have twin daughters. Ben Cohen and his Abby (pictured together in 2003) announced their split in September last year after 11 years of marriage .

Cohen's on-screen chemistry with Kristina Rihanoff, sometimes known as ‘The Siberian siren', was widely noted in the 2013 show . Mrs Bassouls of Alness, Highland, Scotland was told her case was adjourned for a trial due to begin at Corby magistrates on 12 August. Asked if she had any comment to make outside court, Bassouls said: 'I have nothing to say at this time.' Cohen met his wife in 1995, at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before having their daughters in 2008. Their split is the latest in a long list of post-Strictly break-ups. Cohen and Rihanoff perform the Rumba on Strictly Come Dancing in October 2013. The both vehemently denied they had had an affair . Susanna Reid split from the father of her three children following her appearance on the hit show, and Rachel Riley - made her split from her husband known in November - when they called time on their relationship, post-dancing appearance.

"Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files . A Polish man stole secret documents about British nuclear submarines from a neighbour and tried to sell them to his government for £50,000, a court heard today. Marcin Kostrzewa, 31, of Plymouth, Devon, allegedly broke into Shane Spencer’s next-door flat and took the restricted files which were stored in his airing cupboard. They only met when Kostrzewa knocked on Mr Spencer’s door to complain about noise - but he became ‘infatuated’ with him after finding out he worked with submarines, the court was told. Kostrzewa allegedly took the documents after searching online for terms such as ‘spy games’, ‘spies’ and ‘secret documents’ - then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the papers. Alexander Chalk, prosecuting, said Kostrzewa entered the flat of Mr Spencer, who works as an engineer on submarines at the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Chalk told Plymouth Crown Court the Polish man took ‘sensitive or secret material’ and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police. Kostrzewa thought he was in contact with a man called 'Alex' from the Polish government - but in fact he was a UK security services agent. Mr Chalk said the two men met in a Plymouth hotel and their conversation about the deal was recorded. Kostrzewa also allegedly claimed he had stolen the contents of a computer hard drive. The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines. Base: Mr Spencer is an engineer on submarines in the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth . Mr Spencer first met Kostrzewa in late 2011 when the Pole had knocked on his door to complain about noise, the court was told. Mr Spencer’s girlfriend Sophie Berriman concluded that Kostrzewa was lonely and kept turning up at weekends and in the evenings with alcohol. She thought he was ‘infatuated with Shane’. Mr Chalk said: ‘He said he worked on submarines and showed him a picture of a bulkhead - and that image excited the defendant.’ That unrestricted image from a Trafalgar class submarine was one of those later stolen - and Mr Chalk said the Pole must have seen the folder, which was also stolen. Mr Chalk said Kostrzewa’s frequent attendance began to grate on Mr Spencer and his friends, they refused to answer the door to him and he could be heard saying ‘you reject me, you reject me’. The court heard that the Pole asked Mr Spencer out for a drink but Kostrzewa let himself back into his neighbour’s flat alone - telling a flatmate he had ‘lost’ Mr Spencer. Hearing: Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) was told the Polish man took 'sensitive or secret material' and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police .

"Sam Allardyce admits he was wrong to claim Winston Reid had been tapped up after the West Ham defender finally penned a fresh contract with the club. Talks between the Hammers and Reid had been ongoing for several months, with reported interest from the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal leaving many West Ham supporters on tenterhooks over the future of their New Zealand international. Allardyce said in January that it was 'highly unlikely' Reid had not already verbally agreed to leave Upton Park given that he was yet to sign a new contract and went on to suggest earlier this month that he needed to rope in the questioning techniques of Jack Bauer from television's '24' to get an answer out of the player. Winston Reid signed a new six-and-a-half year deal West Ham last week after it appeared he would leave . Sam Allardyce had said it was unlikely that Reid had not verbally agreed to join another club . But the 26-year-old, who will miss Saturday's trip to Arsenal through injury, has now signed a six-and-a-half-year contract to keep him tied down to the east London outfit - with Allardyce quick to admit he had misread the situation. 'I was wrong, so I admit that,' he said when asked if he was surprised to see Reid sign a new deal having questioned whether he had been tapped up. 'For me, if somebody's out of contract like that it would have all been done and dusted by the end of the season, even though it might not have been done and dusted from a paperwork point of view. 'His agent would have sorted out a deal somewhere or other in this country. I was probably more concerned about abroad because it could have been a pre-contract. The central defender had been linked with the likes of Tottenham and Arsenal before penning new contract . 'One of the bigger clubs in Europe could have seen what Winston has done here and said ""he's the one for us"" and taken him abroad so I was obviously wrong.' Allardyce believes a strong showing for West Ham this season would have helped convince Reid to stay put - insisting no club bigger than the Hammers had looked like making a move for his signature. 'It was the longest negotiation ever,' he added. 'I think that in the end both parties are very, very pleased with the outcome. I think the big pull for Winston signing this time around is that we've had a good season up until now that we need to finish off as strong as we can. Reid fights for the ball with Tottenham striker Harry Kane during the recent match at White Hart Lane . '(We are) moving to the Olympic Stadium in 2016, so where else is he going to get bigger than West Ham United?

"A young English fan who wrote a letter to Richie Benaud asking for tips on spin bowling almost 20 years ago has shared the Australian cricket great's response in the wake of his death. Jonathon Stevenson was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter on Friday as a tribute to the 'great man'. 'Wrote to Richie Benaud when I was 16 about bowling leggies. His detailed reply says everything about the great man,' Mr Stevenson, who is now a director at LiveWire Sport, tweeted. Scroll down for video . A letter from Richie Benaud to an English fan, Jonathon Stevenson, almost 20 years ago emerged on Friday in the wake of the cricket legend's death . Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers. 'Your letter was timely because it was the first from a left-hander and it reminded me that there is a difference in coaching and not just in the fact that one youngster might bowl with the right hand and another with the left,' Benaud wrote. 'The ball, although coming out of the hand in the same manner and going in the same direction towards the batsmen, in fact spins differently for the two types of bowlers.' Jonathon Stevenson, who now works at LiveWire Sport, was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter as a tribute to the 'great man' Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers . Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. He was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. 'I hope you enjoy your cricket and your bowling,' Benaud said. 'Yes, the left-arm over-the-wrist bowler who spins the ball into the right-hander from outside the off-stump is said to have bowled a Chinaman. The same bowler who spins one away from the right-hander has bowled a wrong'un.' After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia . The typed letter, dated September 27, 1996, was personally signed by Benaud . It included tips on different deliveries and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered . In his letter to a young Mr Stevenson, he listed a full page of various different deliveries the teenager should try and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered.

Now 17 years on, his facial features and wispy beard are still clearly visible, the People's Daily Online reports. Macabre attraction: Buddhist monk Wu Yunqing was preserved at Lingquan Temple in Anyang . Records show that his parents died he was 15-years-old, leading him to run away to became a monk in Shanxi Yanan Qing Hua Temple. When Wu Yunqing passed away his disciples placed his body in the lotus position and sealed it inside a large porcelain vase with cement. The body was later taken out and placed beneath a crystal glass cover in the Wu Yunqing Memorial Garden at Linquan temple. Then and now: Buddhist Wu Yunqing, pictured left, looks remarkably similar 17-years after his death after he was mummified . Self-mummification was a way to preserve a person’s body after death and was practised in various areas of the world including Asia. Earlier this year, mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position were unearthed in Mongolia with experts estimating the human relic was 200 years old. The amazing mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position were unearthed in Mongolia . Mummified remains of a monk were also found encased in a Buddha statue dating back to the 11th or 12th Century after a CT scan and endoscopy were carried out by Drents Museum at Meander Medical Centre in the Netherlands. It led to hundreds of villagers signing a petition demanding the return of the relic which they believe was stolen in 1995 from Spring Village in eastern China's Fujian province. The mummified remains were discovered at the end of February after he took the statue to the museum in the Netherlands to be restored. According to various Chinese media, the Dutch collector said he is willing to return the Buddha statue if it is proved to be the one stolen from Fujian. A Buddha statue (left) containing a mummified monk (right) was stolen from a village temple twenty years ago, Chinese experts believe . Zhu Guosheng, a mummification master who has preserved the bodies of dozens of monks since 1990s, told Guangzhou Daily that a large porcelain vase is the key to the success of the Buddhist tradition. 'The process can be divided into resting the body in the vase, sealing the body in the vase and opening the vase,’ said Mr Zhu. To help with the preservation, a variety of ingredients are put into the vase, such as ground lime, shredded wood, coal and sandalwood. The body is usually kept in the container for three years before being taken out. Mr Zhu said if it's not rotten, then the deceased monk will potentially be wrapped under a layer of gold foil and turned into

"The money keeps growing but the odds are shortening as the richest fight of all time looks set to break the half-billion-dollar barrier. Both Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are impressing video-watchers and hand-picked visitors to their gyms in Las Vegas and Los Angeles respectively with their dedication and work rate. But a dramatic improvement in the speed and power of the PacMan’s sparring and pad-hitting in the ring have caught the eye of the so-called ‘smart money’ gamblers. Floyd Mayweather's fight with Manny Pacquiao on May 2 is set to break the half-billion-dollar barrier . Pacquiao, who was a 3/1 shot when betting opened, is now down to 2/1 at best. Mayweather, a red-hot odds-on favourite at 2/7 at the start has cooled to 2/3. Some Vegas casinos are predicting what they call a ‘pick ‘em’ even money fight come the big night on May 2. Our best tip at the moment: If you fancy Mayweather get someone to place your bet in Manilla. If you want to back Pacquiao, try Vegas. An improvement in Pacquiao's sparring in the ring has seen 'smart money' gamblers backing him . Carl Froch – who was disgracefully accused of running scared of James DeGale – has added the most feared pound-for-pound puncher in the world to his list of potential opponents. Gennady Golovkin, the killer Kazakh who knocks out opponents for fun, is in the Cobra’s line of fire if a fight cannot be made with Andre Ward at Nottingham Forest's football ground or Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas . Carl Froch has added Gennady Golovkin, the killer Kazakh, to his list of potential opponents . Golovkin has made it clear he is willing to venture to Nottingham while also stepping up a division . And just in case DeGale’s loose-tongued advisors would like to know, if all goes well for both of them this summer Froch would be open to fighting his fellow Brit thereafter. DeGale meets Andre Dirrell in Chicago in May for the IBF title vacated by Froch, who beat the American in Nottingham. Froch says: ‘James has not yet proved himself for a fight with me but if he can beat Dirrell it would become more interesting for me to face him. But not before a big name fight this summer.’ James DeGale fights Andre Dirrell - who Froch beat in Nottingham - for the IBF title in Chicago in May . While Amir Khan and Kell Brook are talking about fighting any and every name in the welterweight division – except each other as far as Khan is concerned - world super-middleweight champion Froch holds an additional option not yet open to these of his countrymen. Retirement. That possibility may be a little more tempting following the offer of a bit part ‘as a villain or a tough guy’ in a gangster movie. But he will not exercise the glove-hanging alternative – at 37 – if he can find ‘a fight which floats my boat.’ Kell Brook, who defeated Jo Jo Dan on Saturday, has spoken of

"(CNN)It's one of the most famous faces in history, even though no one really knows what he looked like. Instead, every culture, every generation, remakes Jesus in its own image. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior when America was mostly Anglo-Protestant, at least in Hollywood's eyes. An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean. If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer. Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from ""Killing Jesus,"" a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. ""A.D.,"" NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries ""The Bible,"" and ""Finding Jesus,"" CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare. Does God have a prayer in Hollywood? What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business, is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood. Haaz Sleiman, from ""Killing Jesus,"" was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians, who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in ""Finding Jesus."" And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in ""A.D.,"" replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed ""hot Jesus,"" by some, ""smarmy Jesus"" by others. You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past. But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say. ""Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed,"" said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of ""Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ."" ""A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India,"" Humphries-Books continued. ""That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways."" The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in. Each of the Jesus shows drew big ratings, which means you'll likely be seeing more of Christ as you channel surf. But according to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong: his flowing locks. Real men don't

"A barrister and Oxford University graduate who spent more than two years avoiding paying for his train ticket could be the biggest fare-dodger to be prosecuted, a court heard. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over a two-and-a-half year period. He travelled from his Oxfordshire home to London Marylebone but pretended to have only gone from Wembley, in north west London. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over two-and-a-half years . Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year . The Australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to £9,714.40 in fares, claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket, and take into account annual leave. But prosecutor Malachy Pakenham told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'If it is accepted that the loss was £23,000, this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the United Kingdom. 'The Crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it. 'The train company are experts, not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed, you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket, you calculate it on a full single fare, of the return for the day, each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket'. Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year. Barnett claimed to have travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire . The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. The Rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from Wembley, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a £550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. The lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children's charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at 'promoting prosperity'. A court heard how the barrister got off at London Marylebone (pictured) by tapping out with an Oyster card . It is understood he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket, and then getting off at Marylebone by simply tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which

"Team Sky's Geraint Thomas had to settle for 14th place in an incident-packed Tour of Flanders as Norwegian Alexander Kristoff took victory in a sprint finish with Holland's Niki Terpstra. With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff . Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did

"(CNN)Her murder shocked a nation, but according to the slain woman's father, it also woke Turkey up. Ozgecan Aslan's body was found last month, burned and abandoned, just days after her family reported her missing. She allegedly fought off a sexual assault before being killed by the driver of a bus she'd taken to go home. Her death sparked widespread protests. ""A country woke up,"" Aslan's father, Mehmet Aslan, told CNN in a phone interview. ""There was no way for so many people to come together over a single killing. But, I know that my Ozgecan was sent for a reason. And as devastating it is, it was her part, her destiny to wake people up."" Aslan, 20, was a first-year university student. She studied psychology. ""My Ozge lived for peace,"" her father said. ""For peace, love and beauty. She believed in a better tomorrow."" Since her death, hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets and online, demanding Turkey do more to protect women. They say the problem is cultural; it's also criminal. Bianet, a Turkish group that tracks violence against women, reports that at least 281 women were killed in Turkey in 2014 -- up 31% from the previous year. According to Hulya Gulbahar, a Turkish activist and women's rights lawyer, laws are irregularly applied. ""In a majority of Turkey's female abuse cases, the perpetrators receive mitigations in their sentences due to court's detection of consent granted by the victim,"" Gulbahar said. ""In some cases, wearing a miniskirt or some cleavage got the woman's rapist mitigation in his punishment, while in some cases the consent was attached to her wearing red."" It's unclear what will happen in Aslan's case. Three suspects have been arrested in her death, Turkey's semiofficial news agency Anadolu has reported. The agency identified the main suspect as 26-year-old Ahmet Suphi Altindoken and said that he had confessed. Aslan reportedly fought him using pepper spray, which had been given to her by her mother. Although he is heartbroken and angry, Mehmet Aslan isn't out for revenge. In fact, his family has received donations from across the country and is planning to use those to set up a rehabilitation center -- not for women who are abused but for men who abuse. ""We must surrender to love,"" he told CNN. ""Otherwise, we all lose."" Aslan's murder is similar in many ways to well-known case in India. There, a student was attacked by five men on a public bus in 2012. She was raped and later died from her injuries. Like Aslan's murder, her death triggered massive outrage and nationwide protests. And like Turkey, India has a serious problem when it comes to women's rights. Out of 142 countries, Turkey ranks 125th (India ranks 114th) on the World Economic Forum's 2014 gender gap index. On Sunday, some 3,000 women marched in Istanbul to mark International Women's Day, Anadolu reported. The female-only rally was dedicated in Aslan's memory. ""Ozgecan's screams have indeed been heard. Maybe not that very instant, but later -- and in millions of hearts,"" said

"Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations at the White House for six years, ended her employment with no notice according to sources with 'close ties to current residence staffers' Despite leaving the White House more than a month ago, official confirmation of the chief floral designer's unexpected departure has only just emerged. Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations for events such as official state dinners for six years, ended her employment with no notice according to sources with 'close ties to current residence staffers'. Dowling 'was escorted from the building' on February 13, reports The Washington Post. In the wake of the Post's revelation and coming almost six weeks after Dowling's departure, the White House released a statement on Tuesday in which it praised her 'lively and colorful' creations, which reflected the 'historic rooms which they graced.' 'As chief florist, Laura Dowling and her team treated guests of the White House to their beautiful floral arrangements,' read a statement issued by Michelle Obama's office on Tuesday. 'Ms Dowling's creations were always lively and colorful, reflecting not only the season but the unique and historic rooms which they graced. 'No two arrangements were ever the same and each one left guests with a lasting impression of the elegance and history of the People's House. We are grateful for her contribution over the years and wish her well.' Within an hour of the first lady's official confirmation, Dowling also felt compelled to release a statement about her sudden departure weeks before. 'After almost six years as Chief Floral Designer at the White House, I have resigned in order to pursue exciting new opportunities and explore my passion for floral artistry and design,' said Dowling in a statement issued by heavyweight law firm Sidley Austin. The first lady's office released a statement on Tuesday which praised the work of florist Laura Dowling who had unexpectedly departed her post more than a month before . 'Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be launching a new platform for my work as an author, speaker, instructor and design consultant that builds on the creative ideas and partnerships I've formed during my tenure there. 'It's been such an honor to work at the White House and I will always be grateful for this incredible opportunity.' But Dowling's unexpected departure and the sudden release of two statements more than a month later has prompted speculation that all was not well between Dowling and the first lady. Several unnamed floral designers who continue to provide bouquets to the White House told the Post that Dowling left because her 'fussy style' wasn't in keeping with the first lady's desire for a modern and clean aesthetic. When Dowling was first appointed she was highly regarded for her organic and less formal 'French look,' but now that seems to have fallen out of favor at the White House. Just days before the florist's departure, the Old Family Dining Room had been re-opened after being refurbished by the First Lady to showcase modern art and design, according to the White House

"Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres believes coach Diego Simeone's clear understanding of the team's weaknesses has been the key to their success as they seek revenge against Real Madrid on Tuesday for last season's Champions League final defeat. With the determined Argentine at the helm, Atletico have belied their economic inferiority to become one of the most dangerous sides in Europe and now the La Liga champions take on Real aiming once again for a place in the semi-finals of the continent's elite competition. In the past Atletico were accustomed to being swept aside by the footballing aristocrats, who claimed their 10th European crown against them in Lisbon, but now they are more than capable of trading blows. Fernando Torres (centre) scored his first ever league own goal during the 2-2 draw with Malaga on Saturday . Torres has praised the coaching style of Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone (centre) In fact since that final, when Atletico were agonisingly close to a victory before a Sergio Ramos header forced extra-time and then Real ran away with the match, Simeone's side has had the upper hand in the Madrid clashes. Atletico beat Real to win the season's Super Cup curtain-raiser, knocked them out of the King's Cup and defeated them in both La Liga clashes. The manner of their 4-0 demolition of Real in February's league meeting even led to questions about the future of coach Carlo Ancelotti. 'It is his character as a player and his character as a coach that drives the team,' Torres told UEFA.com of Simeone. Antoine Griezmann scored twice to help Diego Simeone's side scrape to a 2-2 draw on Saturday .

'We don't have the options that Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern (Munich) or Chelsea have, we cannot drop points and make up for them later. We are a team that plays at our limit.' The pressure is very much on Ancelotti going into the game with Real having surrendered their La Liga lead and dropping two points behind Barcelona. Even so there are positive signs with the team finding its form in recent weeks following the return of Luka Modric and James Rodriguez from injury. Cristiano Ronaldo is also firing on all cylinders with eight goals from four games.

"A niece of one of the victims of the Germanwings crash is haunted by the 'atrocious' thought that her uncle spent the last eight minutes of his life knowing he was going to die. Sandrine Driessens, niece of 59-year-old Belgian father and grandfather Christian Driessens, said that the thought was 'very hard'. 'My uncle certainly knew that he was living his last moments and it's very hard to hear that the descent of the aircraft lasted eight minute,' she told La Provence newspaper. Scroll down for video .

Happy: Although Christian Driessens' niece said she was haunted by the idea that he knew he was going to die for eight minutes while the plane was descending, an aviation expert has said that it is more likely that the passengers and crew were calm and did not realise that they were in mortal danger . 'For eight long minutes, he was dying. This is atrocious! I dare not imagine the horror of parents who tried to protect their babies in this airplane.' But a veteran A320 pilot has said that the passengers would have been unlikely to know that they were going to die. If anything, he said, the plane would have been filled with 'eerie silence'. 'It is likely that there was a problem with the pilots, as they put the plane into descent but failed to control it,' said Tony Newton, who is also an examiner for Britain's Civil Aviation Authority. 'The aircraft descended at fairly normal rate, in a fairly normal way. It was steep, but I have used steeper descents on a regular basis. It was well within the everyday operation and not in any way terrifying.' It is likely the oxygen masks were released, he said, and if passengers did not put them on quickly enough they may have lost consciousness. There also may have been 'unpleasant noises and wind effects', which may have caused some alarm. But the plane was not 'tumbling out of the sky in a screaming dive'. 'The crew was probably sitting there waiting for the pilot to complete the descent,' he said. 'There was probably no indication to passengers of what the end was going to be. 'There may have been some panic when they saw the mountains coming up through the windows, but it would have been brief. 'Either way, in my experience, passengers tend to stay absolutely silent during an emergency. 'It's not a Hollywood panic, it's an eerie silence.' Mr Driessens, born in Kinshasha, had returned to Belgium in 1960 and lived in Couvin and Mons. After meeting his Catalan born wife, Monserat Domingo, the couple settled down in Palleja, 25 km from Barcelona. They had three sons aged 17 to 31, and three grandchildren. 'He was a wonderful man who loved his family above all,' said Ms Driessens. 'For more than 30 years he travelled almost weekly in his job. But in this

She went to an alley near her home to see what happened and then realized it was her son in the ambulance, reports the LA Times. 'When he saw her, he propped himself partially up and cried to her, 'Mommy, Mommy, please come, please come!' ' her attorney's statement said, reports the Press Telegram. 'She walked towards the ambulance, identified herself as his mother, expecting to ride with him to the hospital, but was pushed back by a man in a blue uniform.' Her attorney Sonia Mercado told The Huffington Post: 'He was reaching for her - reaching out to her for help.' 'It's a tough thing to live with as a parent,' said Mercado. 'She is deeply in shock.' Hector Morejon, 19, was shot dead by a police officer on Thursday while in a vacant apartment . The Press Telegram reports that according to the statement, Lucia Morejon asked what happened but was not given any information. It continues: 'At the hospital, Mrs. Mojeron and her family were not allowed to see Hector until he was dead.' In a statement released Monday, the family of Hector Morejon said they are requesting that the LBPD 'immediately release the name and badge number of the officer who is responsible for killing Hector who was unarmed.' Police said officers received a report that several people were trespassing and vandalizing an empty apartment at about 2:45 p.m. Thursday. When they attended they saw there was an open window and a broken window. According to an LBPD press release, an officer looked into the apartment through the broken window and saw a man (later identified as Morejon) standing against a wall. The press release states the officer saw the man turn toward him, while bending his knees and extending his arm out, as if pointing an object which the officer perceived as a gun. The officer then fired, according to police. Morejon,from Long Beach, was initially listed in critical condition, but was later pronounced dead at a hospital. No weapons were found at the scene. 'Objects were collected from the scene, but it has not been yet determined at this point in the investigation if those objects were what the officer observed,' said Sgt. Megan Zabel, a Police Department spokeswoman told the LA Times. 'We are not describing evidentiary detail on what those objects are at this time, as with how many times the suspect was shot.' Police said the

"England full back Mike Brown is still showing signs of concussion and may not play again until the World Cup warm-up matches in August. Nine weeks after being knocked out in the RBS 6 Nations Test against Italy, Brown is still suffering from headaches and has taken no part in training or team meetings since he returned to Harlequins. Conor O'Shea, Harlequins director of rugby, has ruled the 29-year-old out of Saturday's Aviva Premiership match against Sale and he is not expected to face Bath the following week. England star Mike Brown could miss the rest of the season after failing to recover from concussion . Brown was taken off after clashing with Italy's Andrea Masi during the Six Nations match in February . Brown has continued to suffer headaches nine weeks after his injury and has been advised not to play . 'He has headaches throughout the day,' explained O'Shea. 'He's frustrated because he wants to help his team-mates. What's even more frustrating is he can't contribute in meetings. He can't even be in the room to help people because we're sending him home to get himself right. I want to see Mike Brown right when he is in his 50s, not when he is in his prime.' Brown was knocked cold in an accidental collision during England's 47-17 victory over Italy at Twickenham in February and forced to leave the field. He missed the next game against Ireland but played against Scotland and in the championship decider against France after which he admitted he 'didn't feel quite right'. Assuming Harlequins do not reach the Champions Cup play-offs, Brown's last chance to feature before the end of the season will be in the final-round fixture against Newcastle. 'You can't rule out the possibility that he might not play again this season,' said O'Shea. 'Do I think he'll be right for Bath? I don't think so. Do I think we're looking at Newcastle? Yes, but if he's not right then, he's not right.' Feb 14: Knocked out in 13th minute of England's RBS 6 Nations fixture against Italy following huge collision with Andrea Masi. Feb 25: Ruled out of England's Test against Ireland after failing to come through the necessary safety tests. Mar 14: Played 76 minutes in England's Calcutta Cup victory over Scotland. Mar 21: Played full game in England's final-round victory over France. Mar 23: Stood down by club medical staff on day of his return to Harlequins. Cleared to have a week-long holiday in Dubai to aid recovery. Mar 28: Sidelined for Aviva Premiership match against Saracens. Apr 11: Sidelined for Aviva Premiership match against Gloucester. Brown, who is not even allowed to train on an indoor bike until he is symptom free, is England head coach Stuart Lancaster's first-choice full back going into the World Cup and O'Shea backs the player to regain his form quickly. England play a double-header against France in August, before facing Ireland in their third and final warm-up fixture in September. 'He'll have the World Cup warm-ups and he'll be fine,' said O'Shea.

New footage shows how a drone can herd around 120 sheep from Carlow, Ireland, across a field and through a narrow gateway within minutes . The flock in Carlow, Ireland, appears to react to the slight movement of the nifty aircraft - nicknamed 'Shep' - as it flies back and forth, with its blades making a buzzing sound. The drone remains behind them at all times and makes them walk forward as a group until they get to a gate. It even shows off its manoeuvrability by flying close to the ground before zooming into the sky to get the last three animals into the next field. The footage - titled 'Shep the Drone, Worlds first Drone Sheepdog' (sic) - has already been viewed more than 82,000 times on YouTube. As the farmer and photographer stand in one corner of the field the drone does all of the hard work, forcing the sheep towards the gate . The sheep stay in a group while the drone flies behind them.

"Heather Mack, facing a death sentence if she is convicted of murdering her mother, took her new-born baby daughter back to hospital on Friday after the child showed no signs of improvement from her earlier sickness. Doctors are reported to have been shocked at the lack of motherly attention shown to baby Stella. A prison source said medical staff were appalled at the baby's dirty condition. Scroll down for video . Second visit: Heather Mack, facing a death sentence if she is convicted of murdering her mother, took her new-born baby daughter (pictured) back to hospital on Friday after the child still showed signs of illness . Improper treatment: Doctors are reported to have been shocked at the lack of motherly attention shown to baby Stella and a prison source said medical staff were appalled at the baby's dirty condition . 'The mother appears not to have been washing her properly, if at all, ' the source told Dailymail.com exclusively. It is understood there are concerns that because the baby has not been kept clean the area where the umbilical cord was cut might become infected. 'The baby's high fever is more of a concern than the jaundice,' said the source. Miss Mack, 19, obtained permission from the Bali Prosecutor’s office to return, under guard, to the Sanglah Hospital - where she gave birth to Stella Schaefer last week - after pleading for the baby to receive ‘proper hospital treatment’. After baby Stella developed a high fever and her skin took on a yellowish colour - an indication of jaundice - the child was taken on Wednesday to the clinic inside the walls of Kerobokan prison. Seeking help: Miss Mack, 19, pictured on Friday, obtained permission from the Bali Prosecutor’s office to return, under guard, to the Sanglah Hospital so her baby could get 'proper hospital treatment' Neglect claims: When baby Stella returned to the hospital on Friday with her mother Heather Mack, 19, and the pair waited for medical treatment in a busy room . With Miss Mack and her co-accused boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer - the baby’s father - looking on, clinic staff treated the baby with medicines, but her condition did not improve. Throughout Thursday, Miss Mack pleaded to be allowed to return to hospital with the baby, but she was told this would not be allowed until the Prosecutor’s office gave permission. She had to wait a further 24 hours before that permission was given - and today Miss Mack was helped into an ambulance with the baby and taken to the hospital.

Tiny: Miss Mack's shawl briefly slips and the head of the tiny baby, famous even before she was born, was revealed on Monday .

"Sneaky tactics used by airlines, banks and insurance companies to trick millions of customers into buying extra insurance could soon be outlawed. The City watchdog has said it wants to ban companies from ‘opt out’ selling – where customers have to untick a box in the small print if they want to avoid buying an add-on insurance policy. In a damning report, the Financial Conduct Authority said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need. The Financial Conduct Authority said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need . Those that fall into the trap - whether they are buying a concert ticket or paying for car insurance - are more likely to buy inappropriate products, or receive poor value for money. The FCA estimates the scam is costing customers more than £108 million a year in overpayments. The market for such products - including identity theft protection, home insurance and breakdown cover – is worth an estimated £1billion a year to the insurance industry. They are typically sold alongside insurance such as travel, car and home cover. But just under a fifth of customers are not even aware they have them, according to the FCA. The sale of add-on products has already given rise to the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, where millions of customers were sold policies they did not want or need alongside loans or credit cards. High street banks and other lenders have paid out £18billion in compensation so far – making it the most expensive mis-selling scandal in UK history. The sneaky tactics are used by airlines and banks with products - including identity theft protection, home insurance and breakdown cover - typically sold alongside travel and car insurance and home cover . Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA said: ‘This is about ensuring consumers can make the right decision on what add-on insurance they do or don’t need. Forgetting to untick a box at the end of a purchase is not making an informed choice.’ Similar tactics are used by firms to barrage customers with junk mail and marketing. The ban would apply to add-on sales of all products alongside financial primary policies - meaning the insurance policy or loan that the customer intended to buy in the first place. Paying out: The FCA estimates the scam is costing customers more than £108 million a year in overpayments . Key examples include key cover sold alongside motor insurance, or protection cover when taking out a mortgage or credit card. The City watchdog also wants firms to inform customers about add-on policies earlier in the sales process – rather than just before they make the purchase - so they can make an informed choice and shop around. Existing rules are already meant to protect customers who are buying an add-on financial policy alongside a non financial product such as a plane ticket. The sale of insurance add-ons is hugely lucrative, with insurance companies making bumper profits. According to a separate study

"Former Wales and British Lions flanker Martyn Williams has called on the RBS 6 Nations organisers to change the way they draw up the Player of the Championship shortlist after Sam Warburton was left out of 12-man nominations. Warburton, 26, was one of his country's best players throughout the competition but the Wales skipper is not up for the top gong, which is based upon performance statistics rather than balanced expert opinions. Dan Biggar and Alun-Wyn Jones are the only Welsh nominations while Scotland, who lost every game, also have two players in the running in Jonny Gray and Stuart Hogg. Wales skipper Sam Warburton races away for a try during his side's 60-21 trouncing of Italy in Rome . 'Sam is the standout name not on that list,' Williams told Sportsmail. 'It was a big surprise. It's always very contentious, but it's picked using statistics and I don't think that's the way to do it. I prefer the way they do it for World Player of the Year where they use a panel of experts to get a general consensus. Sam can feel very hard done by for not making it. You could make a case for Leigh Halfpenny and Liam Williams as well. 'Sam's stats are always very high but penalties can count against you if you play on the edge. His influence on the team can't be measured through stats because they don't capture those big moments in a game where the big players stand up. 'Sam will be the player to win a big turnover to win a big game; but that just counts as one turnover on a stat sheet. He's a fantastic role model and a leader by actions.' Wales fly half Dan Biggar has made the Six Nations shortlist for Player of the Championship . Wales lock Alun-Wyn Jones is the only other Welsh player to make the 12-man shortlist . After losing their opening Test against England, Wales went on to win all of their remaining fixtures and eventually finished third on points difference. Warren Gatland expects his side to be serious challengers at the World Cup and, if they can continue to build on their momentum, Williams believes they have the talent to make the final at Twickenham. 'This squad has more or less been together for four years, so they're in a really good place,' said Williams. 'They will obviously be disappointed not to win the tournament but, in terms of the bigger picture, they're looking good for the World Cup. Can they be challengers? Yes, why not? The group stages are just as difficult as the quarter and semi finals. That's how finely balanced it is. If they win the group, then they could go all the way. Then again, they might not get out of their group at all.' Former Wales flanker Martin Williams has called for changes to be made to the nominations procedure .

"As the scorer of Gibraltar’s first-ever competitive goal, it was little wonder that history-maker Lee Casciaro felt like a Rock star when he left Hampden Park on Sunday night. However, as the 33-year-old Ministry of Defence policeman would later reveal, he was not the first man from the tiny British overseas territory to make an arresting impact at the National Stadium. If the outstanding memory of the 2002 Champions League Final for most people remains Zinedine Zidane’s exquisite volleyed goal, in Gibraltar it was the sight of local businessman Joe Beriro invading the park clad in a kilt and a Real Madrid strip. Gibraltar's players celebrate after Lee Casciaro scored their first ever competitive goal on Sunday . Beriro would later appear on Gibraltar’s version of Strictly Come Dancing, before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye. His place as the most famous man in Gibraltar now passes to Casciaro after criminal defending by Scotland allowed the cop to race clear, fire low past David Marshall and utterly stun Hampden. For the striker, all the years spent pounding the hard yards on pavements and playing in sub-standard facilities were worth it as he followed in the famous footsteps of Zidane by scoring a goal to remember in Mount Florida. Casciaro (centre) celebrates the goal that will have made him the most famous man in Gibraltar . ‘It was a Gibraltarian who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his Madrid shirt in that Champions League Final in 2002. I remember that well,’ he beamed. ‘It was just a dream come true for me to score that goal. It’s unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for Gibraltar. ‘I don’t think I will get a hero’s reception when I get home. We still lost the game – but it is still an achievement to get the goal. Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba celebrates the goal at Hampden Park, which levelled the score at 1-1 . ‘We have only just joined UEFA and started to train on a football pitch. All my life, we’ve been training wherever we can, running on the road, or for 90 minutes a week on a seven-a-side pitch. ‘Even two or three years ago I didn’t think I would be playing for Gibraltar because I didn’t think we would get into UEFA. Everything has happened so fast and we are learning every day. ‘This goal is something that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I knew it was going in as soon as I hit it. It was a great feeling. ‘I swapped my second shirt with Ikechi Anya but I kept my shirt from the first half. I am going to put it up in my house! But I’m hoping there are more goals to come for me in future.’ Casciaro (right) vies for the ball with Scotland's Ikechi Anya, who he later swapped shirts with . Despite ultimately losing 6-1 to Gordon Strachan’s side, Casciaro hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions

"The fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation, but people in this South Carolina city aren't surprised. They call it inevitable in a police department they believe focuses on petty crimes and fails to keep its officers in check. There is almost nothing in Michael Thomas Slager's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light. People in the community he served say this reflects what's going wrong with policing today: Officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain. Scroll down for video . Residents of the Charleston, South Carolina, have said the shooting of unarmed black driver Walter Scott was preceded by previous unheeded complaints about the police. Above, a friend of Scott's at a memorial . The officer who shot Scott, Michael Slager, had little in his file to suggest excessive force. Above, two men pray at the memorial . 'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday. The mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases. Nationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said. 'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.' Both Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence. Video captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away . Original statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident . A dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light . Slager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police. His new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.' Slager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family

"Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp feels he still has plenty to offer football but only at the right club, having turned down a 'mind-blowing' offer to coach abroad. The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'. Redknapp will return to the dugout on Sunday, May 31 when he leads a star-studded Men United XI against Leyton Orient Legends, as O's youth coach and Prostate Cancer UK ambassador Errol McKellar hosts a charity football match at The Matchroom Stadium. Harry Redknapp (right) says he would consider a return to management as long as it's at the right club . Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match . The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February . Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago . The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time . 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently

"Paul Casey insists he is desperate to play in the Ryder Cup again, even though he looks unlikely to rejoin the European Tour in time to earn qualifying points this season. Only Tour members can play on the team and Phoenix-based Casey gave up his membership after deciding in January to concentrate on the PGA Tour in order to get back into the world's top 50. The move has paid off with the former world No 3 losing a play-off in the Northern Trust Open and finishing joint third in the Honda Classic to climb to 44th at the start of this week. Paul Casey, practicing ahead of the Masters in Augusta, 'desperately' wants to return to the Ryder Cup . The Englishman has returned to the world's top 50 after leaving the European Tour to concentrate on his game . However, even if he rejoins the European Tour before the May 1 deadline to be eligible to accrue Ryder Cup points when the race starts in August, he will struggle to play the 13 events required for membership. 'It was very straightforward when I was top 10 in the world playing both tours,' Casey told Sportsmail ahead of his first Masters appearance since 2012. 'I know I am back in the top 50 but I have only just got back into the top 50. It was a very difficult decision but it was also the correct decision. 'I still have to play 13 events and right now I am not in the US Open or Open or HBSC Champions at the end of the year. Playing 13 becomes difficult when you haven't played at the start of the year in Middle East.' Casey celebrates while watching a replay of his hole-in-one, which helped Europe to victory in 2006 . Casey last played in the Ryder Cup competition in the 2008 defeat by USA at Valhalla . Casey played in the record Ryder Cup wins in 2004 and 2006 and the 2008 defeat at Valhalla, but was in tears after being overlooked for a wild card by captain Colin Montgomerie in 2010, when he was ranked seventh in the world. 'I desperately want to be part of a Ryder Cup again. There is definitely passion and a fire there burning,' he added. 'Certainly one of them I felt like I was maybe denied, the others I haven't been in a position to make the team and watching Medinah and Gleneagles has been brilliant. 'What they have done has been absolutely phenomenal and I want to be part of that again and not just part of it, but a real solid team player and leader in the team room, which I know I can be. When I play my best golf I think I can certainly play that kind of role.' European captain Darren Clarke said earlier this week he wanted Casey on his team for Hazeltine next year, and the 37-year-old added: 'Paul (McGinley) said the same thing (even though I was a member of the Tour at the time).

"MP for North West Leicestershire Andrew Bridgen . Teachers should be forced to sit A-level exams along with their pupils, an MP has suggested. Andrew Bridgen wants the Conservative Party to put the proposal in its manifesto and has discussed the issue with Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. Teaching unions have previously cautioned against the move, but Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said the change was a logical way to drive-up educational standards. He said: 'My idea would be to have the teacher sit the exam themselves, along with the students. 'After all, how can they be expected to pass on their knowledge to students to allow them to succeed in the exam, if they themselves could not? 'This would help improve teaching standards because if a teacher did poorly, this could be looked into and their skills improved upon.' His comments came as it emerged that Michael Gove still plays a leading role in shaping the Government's education policy, according to the Schools Minister. David Laws said the Conservative Chief Whip, who was moved from the Department of Education in last summer's cabinet reshuffle, joins Number 10 and the Treasury in dictating policy rather than education secretary Nicky Morgan. Ms Morgan has previously denied reports Mr Gove was 'back seat driving' as 'nonsense' but Mr Laws, her Liberal Democrat deputy, appeared to undermine her picture of a united front. He told the Independent: 'While Nicky Morgan's instincts are moderate, the people who control education policy in the Conservative Party are still Michael Gove, David Cameron and George Osborne. The Tory MP thinks teachers should sit the exams alongside their pupils to improve standards (file picture) 'The face and language may have changed but the Tory policies haven't.' Last month the Labour Party said that headteachers would receive business and leadership coaching under plans aimed at raising standards and improving management of multi-million pound school budgets. Morgan claimed recently that teachers are ‘working far too hard, for far too long’ and has promised to slash their workload. The Education Secretary lined up with Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg to propose ways to lighten the burden on school staff. This includes not making alterations to qualifications in the academic year or during a course unless in ‘exceptional circumstances’.

"Devin M. Gesell, 17, from St. Charles, is accused of breaking into the home in November . Three teen burglars stole ashes after mistaking them for cocaine - and only realized after they tasted them. Devin M. Gesell, 17, is accused of breaking into the home in St Peter’s, Missouri, in November with two others - a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old who can not be named for legal reasons. The trio thought they had come across a stash of cocaine and took it from the house along with a necklace worth $500, a Xbox 360 game system, bottles of prescription drugs oxycodone and morphine, and over $800 in cash, reports the St. Louis Post- Dispatch. But when they tasted the ashes, which were in a wooden box, they realized their mistake - and threw the homeowner's father's ashes out of the car. Gessel later told the police they could not remember where they threw them out so police have not been able to retrieve them. According to police, the three knew the family who lived at the home and planned the burglary after seeing a Facebook post which indicated they were going to be away. But they were caught after police tracked them through an IP address used on the Xbox. Gesell was charged this week with burglary and two counts of theft. He told police he acted as lookout as the other two went through the house after breaking in through the back door. His bail is set at $10,000 cash-only. His accomplices, ages 15 and 16, were referred to juvenile authorities for charges. Debora Matthews, the victim of the robbery told Kmov.com: 'I just couldn't believe that they would take the ashes.'

"Tim Sherwood has confirmed he will start Shay Given against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39. Given has been selected each round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and Sherwood said he would keep faith with his deputy goalkeeper. Brad Guzan, Villa’s No 1, suffered heartbreak in 2010, when he was understudy to Brad Friedel but played every round of the League Cup – before being left out of the final against Manchester United by manager Martin O’Neill. Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets . Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39 . But Sherwood said there would be no such turnaround this year, with Given lasting until the final if Villa make it there. ‘Shay plays. Absolutely,’ said Sherwood. ‘He’s done nothing wrong Shay, he’s a large part of the reason we’re in this semi-final. ‘The saves he made against Leicester were fantastic and at the right time. He trains fantastically well and he’s pushing Brad all the way for that No 1 spot.’ Sherwood watched his Villa side in training on Friday as they prepare for the weekend's crunch clash . Tom Cleverley will be hoping to start at Wembley as he bids to impress with his loan expiring in the summer . Carlos Sanchez signed for Aston Villa from Elche during the summer and has made 31 appearences . Sherwood believes Villa can upset favourites Liverpool. ‘It’s a very exciting game, a great opportunity for this club to get to an FA Cup final,’ he added. ‘I’ve lost semi-finals myself, not a great feeling. ‘We’re going in with a positive state of mind. This club’s relegation is not at stake on Sunday it is about us maybe getting some glory for the football club. ‘We have the mindest to win the game, impose ourselves on a very good Liverpool side, that’s what we intend to do. ‘We think we’re capable, we have a good blend of players who can play and maybe go direct at time. We’re prepared to mix it up, we have a plan and we hope we can affect Liverpool.’ Fabian Delph (left) and Christian Benteke (right) were put through their paces ahead of Sunday's semi-final .

"It is always revealing to see how players respond to adversity and Joe Root has reacted magnificently to being left out of last year’s Sydney Test. I can remember players left out when I played having a moan in the dressing room and spouting nonsense about how they did not fit in. What Root has done is have a look at himself, stay quiet and then produce hundred after hundred to ensure he will not be left out in a hurry again. Joe Root showed plenty of grit, as well as talent, in yet another big innings for England . Root has bounced back from a difficult Ashes Tour to prove himself as a quality Test batsman . Around four years ago I remember sitting next to Graham Thorpe on a bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young English batsman to watch out for was Joe Root. He was barely heard of then. How right Thorpe was, for what Root has done since Sydney speaks volumes about the character of the bloke. Do not be fooled by the boyish grin and cheeky demeanour. He is as steely as they come, a fierce competitor who loves playing for England. He tells himself every day that he must enjoy the game but that takes nothing away from the quality of his magnificent performances. His last five hundreds have been in excess of 149, four of them have been unbeaten and in the way he batted with Jimmy Anderson yesterday he showed he has a very good cricket brain. And he hasn’t messed with his form either. It would be easy in his current run to chip up a catch on 40 or give it away as soon as he reaches a hundred, as Marlon Samuels did in the first innings here. I love the way Root goes big. Before his partner was foolishly run out, Root showed maturity to bat with the tail on Friday in Grenada . The young batsman has been superb in his middle-order role, and should not be moved up the batting card . Part of me sees Root as a natural No 3, where England tried him in Australia. He looks like a batsman who could come in and regain the initiative if you lose an early wicket. But why move him when he is going so well at five? Keep him there. Eventually he will captain England and five is a good place to captain from. The only problem in seeing him as a future England captain is that do we want to put our best player in charge when his runs are so important? Look at Alastair Cook and just about every England captain in history. It wears them all down in the end and when the day eventually comes that England need a new leader they will have to think about that. His fabulous form should be enough to see Root left to do what he does best - score runs for England . Alastair Cook (right) has shown the danger of making

The 26-year-old Made In Chelsea star showed off his impressive six-pack while out hiking at the No 1 Boot Camp in Marrakech. Former lothario Spencer was determined to get toned for the next series of the E4 reality show which starts again on April 13. Scroll down for video . Spencer Matthews headed to the No 1 Boot Camp in Morocco with his girlfriend Lauren Frazer-Hutton . Spencer and Lauren looked like they were enjoying working out while hiking through the Atlas Mountains . So he booked himself in to the boot camp which offers intensive daily military-style fitness sessions. And it has clearly paid off by the looks of his rippling pecs, biceps and abs. Spencer took his girlfriend of five months, Lauren Frazer-Hutton, on the trip - and in the mornings the couple would work-out with a group of 12 other campers staying at the luxury villa. They would take part in grueling sessions of cardio workouts, weights and circuits. In the afternoons they would often go on long romantic hikes together in the foot-hills of the Atlas mountains only coming back to the villa for the evening meal. Temperatures in Morocco got up to 20C and so Spencer was often seen walking around with his top off, whilst Lauren wore a pretty pink crop top. Spencer looked on a little bemused as Lauren did some stretches on the side of the road . Spencer stopped to do a few press ups on some rocks, it certainly beats going to the gym! The good-looking couple spent some time laying in the sunshine as the showed off their impressive tans . Spencer and Lauren flew out to Morocco last week and stayed at the boot camp’s luxury five-star villa just outside Marrakech. Every morning they were woken at 6am and had an hour of exercise before breakfast. At 8.30am they would have an hour and a half of cardio training – boxing or spinning, followed by a snack at 10am, then circuit training at 10.30am until 12. Lunch would be an hour and then they would have long hikes, followed by team games and then yoga and stretching exercise. The evening meal would follow at 7.30pm. Spencer and Lauren covered up for part of the walk - the couple have been dating for around five months now . Despite their tiring work outs Spencer still found time to have a bit of a laugh on the mouthain . All the meals were prepared fresh on site each day and were all local produce and organic. Breakfast would consist of eggs, fresh fruit salad, with a small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. A typical lunch would be fish or chicken brochettes cooked on the BBQ and a selection of salads, and dinner would be a soup and a chicken tagine, all served by the villa’s waiting staff. The calorie intake for each day would be limited to around 1,200 Kcal and

"Are you curious and creative but a bit standoffish? Then you're probably a Londoner. Think of yourself as more dependable and down to earth? You may well live in the Midlands. And if you pride yourself on your friendliness and ability to stay calm in a crisis, you're most likely to be Scottish. This is according to experts at Cambridge University, who have marked out a personality map of the whole of Britain. Revealed: The moody map of Britain details the country's most and least friendly inhabitants . The profile revealed that inhabitants of the capital are the least welcoming of all. The Welsh also fare badly, with the researchers declaring them to be exceptionally shy and neurotic. The Scots, however, can hold their heads high, as they are the friendliest and most emotionally stable people in Britain. To find out what where we live says about us, psychologists asked almost 400,000 Britons a series of questions designed to assess five key personality traits. They then looked to see how common each of the five characteristics – agreeableness, extraversion, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism – was in each of the 380 council areas in England, Scotland and Wales. Characteristics: People in the Midlands were among the most conscientious (left), suggesting that like residents of the Scottish Highlands, they are dependable, reliable types. Meanwhile those who lived in the capital scored highly on extraversion (right), as did the people of Manchester . Mapped out: The Scots scored highest in agreeableness (left), which covers friendliness, trust, co-operation and concern about others. The Scots also emerged as the least neurotic (right) and the most calm and contented. The colour red means a greater level of an attribute, while blue is for the opposite . New experiences: Inhabitants of the East Midlands and the east of England were the least open – leading to them being labelled 'conventional, down to earth and traditional' The result is a fascinating, and at times controversial, snapshot of the psychology of Britain. The Scots scored highest in agreeableness. The first of the five traits polled, it covers friendliness, trust, co-operation and concern about others. People in Devon, Somerset, East Anglia and Yorkshire are also highly agreeable sorts. And at the other end of the scale are the residents of London, who were found to be the least friendly of all. Rather than being warm and welcoming, they are likely to be uncooperative, quarrelsome and irritable, the journal PLOS ONE reports. Those who lived in the capital, however, scored highly on extraversion, as did the people of Manchester. In contrast, those living in the Scottish Highlands and parts of Lincolnshire were among the most quiet and reserved. Londoners fared badly in the study - they were found to be among some of Britain's least friendly residents . City-dwellers also did well on another trait, openness. This is a measure of curiosity, imagination and intellect, and was particularly high in London, Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton, Bristol, Manchester and Glasgow. Residents of some parts of Wales were also deemed creative and curious. Inhabitants of the

"While one husband only left his wife a farthing because she called him a 'rotten old pig', another man bequeathed £26,000 to Jesus Christ - but only if He could prove His identity. The bequests in these bizarre wills also include one from a father who wanted his step-daughter to receive the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages' after her late mother did not pay her for them. The team at genealogy firm Fraser and Fraser - based in Farringdon, central London - have spent almost half a century compiling a list of the strangest requests they have discovered on wills. Unusual: The strange wills include the 1888 document by boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence . 'Rotten old pig: Mr Orton, who only left one farthing to his wife, was born in 1818 and died in 1888, aged 70 . Bequest: Frank Smith, from Romsey, Hampshire, wrote in his will to leave all remaining possessions to his daughter if she did not continue living with her 'immoral husband' or allow him to benefit from the inheritance . Writing's on the will: Isaac Cooke from Surrey, who died in 1936, left everything to his wife, Alice. He wrote his entire will in a seven-verse rhyming poem. One section reads: 'To Alice Cooke my loving wife, for her to keep or use. Without reserve throughout her life, however she may choose' During that time the experts have dug up scores of unusual passages written on the legal declarations - before whittling these down to a top ten, which have now been revealed. Their discoveries include the 1888 will of boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence. They also found a 'beautifully written' seven-versed poem and a will revealing how a man left money to Christ, as long as He could prove His identity. In another will, 59-year-old Annie Langabeer wanted to give her brother-in-law two shillings and sixpence so he could 'buy a rope' because she wanted him to hang himself. Employees at the firm have looked through a staggering 200,000 wills since the late 1960s trying to trace people's family trees.

"Two months before man set foot on the moon for the first time, Gordon Strachan stood on the Hampden terraces to witness a Halley's Comet moment. Just 12 at the time, he could hardly have known 46 years would pass before a Scotsman scored another international hat-trick. 'I was here when Colin Stein scored four,' said the Scots boss after Steven Fletcher's star turn against Gibraltar. 'It's a long time ago — and a few stone ago — but I was there.' Steven Fletcher celebrates scoring a hat-trick for Scotland in the 6-1 victory over Gibraltar . Fletcher is the first Scotland player to score three goals in a game since Colin Stein in 1969 . Fletcher (right) scored his third goal with a left-footed strike from range for Scotland against Gibraltar . Fletcher was recently mocked on Twitter for buying a Lamborghini after inconsistent form for his club, Sunderland . Shaun Maloney converted a penalty to put Scotland ahead against Gibraltar at Hampden Park on Sunday . Scotland (3-4-3): Marshall 6; Hutton 6, Martin 6, Robertson 5; Ritchie 4 (Greer 46), Brown 6, Maloney 6, Morrison 5, Anya 6 (Bannan 74); Naismith 6 (Rhodes 66), Fletcher 7. Subs not used: Gordon, McGregor, Russell, McArthur, May, Darren Fletcher, Forsyth, Berra, Forrest. Goals: Maloney 18, 34 (both pens), Fletcher, 29, 70, 90, Naismith 39. Gibraltar: (4-5-1): Robba 4; Wiseman 5, Joseph Chipolina 6, Artell 4 (Garcia 53), Ryan Casciaro 5; Roy Chipolina 5 (Gosling 74), Lee Casciaro 6, Payas 5, Walker 5, Priestly 5; Bardon 5 (Daniel Duarte 82). Subs not used: Jordan Perez, Coleing, Kyle Casciaro, Sergeant, Brian Perez, John Paul Duarte, Bosio, Jolley. Goal: Casciaro, 19 . Referee: Mattias Gestranius (Finland) The Group D standings after Scotland's 6-1 win vs Gibraltar . He was back again, on Sunday night. The old ash wooden steps are long gone, but the technical area provided an excellent vantage point to watch the landmarks tumble down as heavily as the rain over Glasgow. Fletcher climbed back into his Lamborghini as the first Scotland player to drive home a hat-trick since Stein in an 8-0 win over Cyprus in May 1969. Strachan's team became the first in dark blue to rack up half a dozen goals since a 6-0 thrashing of the Faroes in 2006. And, to prove history comes in all shapes and sizes, David Marshall became the first keeper to lose a goal to the minnows of Gibraltar in a competitive international. 'McGregor and Gordon now love me,' said Strachan, only half joking. 'They think I'm the best manager in the world for not picking them —they're not in the history books.' Rightly, Scotland's boss was quick to hand credit to the visitors. Fletcher took the headlines with his first goals for his country since April 2009, Shaun Maloney scoring two penalties and Steven Naismith the other. Yet this was a patchy, unconvincing performance at times. The Scots won the three points and are still on course in Group D.

"Gareth Bale is approaching the end of his second season at Real Madrid, but the world's most expensive player admits he still finds it surreal to be called a 'Galactico'.

"A gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay - in a fight that has cost taxpayers £200,000. The 78 Irish travellers, who hail from just four families, had refused to budge despite facing three different courts, a planning inquiry and a council. And locals in Hardhorn, Lancashire, accused the group of trashing their leafy village - and branded them the 'neighbours from hell'. A gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay . The group claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans . Last October, the camp, which had flouted planning rules, appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal. But despite being given four months to leave the site without the chance to appeal, the group used a loophole to take their case to the Supreme Court. They claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans. The Supreme Court later rejected pleas for the group to be allowed the right of appeal under a 'point of law of general public importance.' But now it has been revealed that a further judicial review at the High Court has been granted. Fylde Council said that fighting the 'Battle of Hardhorn' has already cost the local authority £200,000 in legal fees which will be met by the public purse. Parish councillor Maxine Chew said: 'It is a disgrace that a shocking amount of public money has been spent fighting this. 'The travellers really have been the neighbours from hell. The amount of anti-social behaviour like fly tipping, theft, drunkenness has escalated hugely in the past four years since the travellers set up camp.' The camp (pictured) appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal last year . A village spokesman added: 'After five years five months the travellers site have fought every decision, we believe that they have used legal aid to fight the Secretary of State and Fylde BC. 'The question what we would like to know is how these people qualified for legal aid? Using taxpayers' money to fight the taxpayer!' He added the decision to hold a judicial review on the grounds presented is 'totally wrong'. 'This community will be devastated with this news as we have been so patient and have endured over 450 negative incidents over the five-plus years. 'Over eight caravans set on fire to burn refuse, horses killed & dogs killed on the road from the site, drunken labourers asleep in gardens, police raids and many cases of ASB. 'The judge might have had a different view if he lived by this site. We wanted this ordeal to come to an end. There are or have been three houses

"An axe-wielding robber has been jailed after his attempt to rob a store was foiled when he was jumped on by the shopkeeper and hit by his wife with a baseball bat. Ex-juvenile offender Shaun Andrew McKerry, dubbed Boomerang Boy or Homing Pigeon Boy in his youth, burst into Shildon Post Office and Stores, County Durham, at 8pm on March 15. The masked 31-year-old waved an axe as he demanded cash from terrified assistant Andrea Brighty, but he did not see owner Sab Dhillon's rugby tackle which dropped him to the floor, sending shelves and produce tumbling. Scroll down for video . As the men wrestled, Sab Dhillon's wife Sam helped by hitting McKerry with a baseball bat . She struck him twice, helping to disarm him while her husband twisted him around to reveal his face to the cameras . As the men wrestled, and with McKerry still holding the axe, Mr Dhillon's wife Sam helped, hitting him twice with a baseball bat to make him drop the weapon. Blood can be seen coming from the would-be robber's nose as Mr Dhillon gestures to his wife to drop the bat. Minutes later the police arrived and arrested McKerry. He previously pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court to attempted robbery and court officials confirmed he had been jailed for six years after the hearing today. McKerry, from Coundon near Bishop Auckland, earned the nicknames Boomerang Boy or Homing Pigeon Boy as he always returned home after committing a crime. He started shoplifting at the age of 12 and by 15 he had been arrested 80 times, and had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. McKerry once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. His earned his moniker in the 1990s after he was arrested 80 times in 1995 and 45 times during the 36 weeks he managed to stay out of prison in 1998. McKerry (pictured aged 15) was dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' in the 1990s because he always returned home after his crimes . Mr Dhillon said McKerry was waving the axe around when he jumped on him and wrestled him to the floor .

"Robert Durst has been absolved of state gun charges in Louisiana. The ruling on Thursday clears the way for federal proceedings on similar charges in New Orleans, which local lawyers believe he can win. Durst, 72, who faces a murder charge in an unrelated California case, remains jailed without bond in Louisiana. Scroll down for video . Next step: Jailed millionaire Robert Durst has been absolved of state gun charges in Louisiana. He will now face federal charges, which lawyers believe he can win, before a murder trial in California . He was arrested at a hotel in the New Orleans capital in March a day before the finale of his HBO docu-series The Jinx. Authorities said he had a gun and marijuana in his room. Defense Attorney Dick DeGuerin said state and federal prosecutors had been discussing the possibility of the state case being dismissed. He says he was pleased with the decision. 'It makes sense to try this case in federal court because FBI agents arrested Mr. Durst, and there shouldn't be two prosecutions, state and federal, at the same time for the same crime,' DeGuerin said in an email. 'We're looking forward to our day in court.' A spokesman for District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro confirmed the move, saying Cannizzaro has a close working relationship with federal authorities in New Orleans. 'The District Attorney did reserve the right to look at the case again upon its conclusion in federal court,' assistant prosecutor Christopher Bowman said. Durst had faced state charges of possessing a handgun with drugs and illegal possession of a handgun by a felon. Legal battle: The 72-year-old was arrested in March the day before the finale of an HBO docu-series about him . Durst (right) was arrested for the murder of his friend and writer Susan Berman (left) in 2000, which some believe he may have committed to stop her from talking to authorities about the disappearance of his wife . Durst, the heir to a vast real estate fortune before becoming estranged from his family, is also connected to the 1982 disappearance of first wife Kathy McCormack (left, with Durst) and the killing of Morris Black (right) The charge in the federal indictment says Durst violated the federal gun-control act because he was in possession of a firearm after being convicted of earlier felonies. His lawyers say the arrest in mid-March was timed to mesh with the finale of The Jinx, HBO's six-part series about Durst, his wife's disappearance, Berman's death, and the death and dismemberment of Durst's neighbor Morris Black in 2001. Authorities found more than $44,000 in Durst's hotel room, according to legal papers filed Wednesday. After his arrest, they intercepted a package containing personal items and $117,000 that was sent to the hotel for Everette Ward — the name Durst used to register there. During a hearing last month, a prosecutor said the package of $100 bills, a head-and-chest latex mask and a map folded to show Louisiana, Florida and Cuba were evidence that Durst was likely to flee if bond was set for

Clinton is seen here on Saturday, walking with her Secret Service agent. She's currently on a two-day swing through the Granite State . Clinton starts the second leg of her endeavor to win the vote of 'everyday' Americans on the heels of a news report showing she makes more money for an hour's worth of work than the country's top CEOs. The former secretary of state was banking $300,000 for paid appearances before she ditched the speaking circuit for an offensive on the White House. The average CEO's hourly rate is $54,213, the Washington Examiner, pointed out. She makes more on the days she's paid a premium to give remarks than big wigs of the likes of Ralph Lauren, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners co-founder Richard Kinder and former Vornado president and CEO Michael Fascitelli. Taken in the context of a full work week, though, Clinton's rate drops far below what corporate heads are hauling in.

"An NFL defensive back with a history of legal problems is being investigated after reports of an early-morning incident involving a physical fight and at least one shot being fired at a Texas club. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother are being investigated for aggravated assault after an altercation at a Dallas-area nightclub on Wednesday morning, according to reports. During a 2011 incident involving two guns when he playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Talib and his mother were accused of shooting a gun at his sister's live-in boyfriend in Garland, Texas. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother Yaqub are being investigated for aggravated assault . Talib was in trouble before and was wanted on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2011 . During the latest incident, a shot was fired outside of Club Luxx in Dallas, Texas, after a physical fight inside . During the incident on Wednesday, Talib and his brother Yaqub had a physical altercation with someone inside Club Luxx and then a shot was fired outside around 2am, WFAA reported. When Dallas officers responded to the active shooter call, the man who called police said three black men had been involved in a disturbance and one of them had tried to punch him. The man also said one of the men pulled out a gun and aimed it at him before firing a round off into the sky outside the bar and causing 'an immediate panic'. The Talibs left the area in a Range Rover and a Jaguar and went to the XTC Cabaret. Police found the brothers at the second club and impounded the vehicles to look for evidence. The brothers were both questioned and an investigation into the incident is ongoing. The general manager of Club Luxx, confirmed the Talibs were at the club but denied that anything with a gun transpired, the Dallas Morning News reported. Hanney Kamal said: 'One-hundred percent that did not happen. 'I was there. Somebody might have called the police because there was a yelling argument. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract last year . 'It's athletes — someone sees them yelling and dials 911. 'Everyone was asked to leave the club, which they did of their own free will, and that was it.' Broncos vice president of public relations Patrick Smyth said: 'We have been in touch with Aqib regarding these reports and will continue to monitor this situation.' Dallas police falsely reported Talib had been arrested for throwing bottles last June during an NFL camp afterparty, the Denver Post reported. The police apologized after it ended up being Yaqub who was arrested. During the 2011 incident in Garland, felony warrants were issued for Talib and his mother Okolo Talib on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police suspected them both of firing shots from a Ruger .380 handgun at Shannon Billings, the boyfriend of Talib's sister, and also believed the NFL back attempted to pistol-whip Billings with a Springfield 9mm semiautomatic handgun during the incident, the Boston Globe reported.

"Britain's fittest grandmother has set a new world record in weightlifting just one year after she took up the sport because her local swimming pool was closed as result of council cuts. All-action Lindsey Gowland, 57, played basketball to a national level as a teenager and then took to the water after turning 40.

Sports-mad Lindsey Gowland shows off her muscles with this deadlift . The lecturer won three weightlifting golds at the British Championships in Stafford last month . Lindsey Gowland, from Kingswinford, West Midlands, discovered weights when her swimming pool closed . The mum-of-four - who works as a sports lecturer and lives in Kingswinford, West Midlands - was then introduced to dumbbells by her colleague Martin Beastall at the end of 2013. Lindsey initially lifted the weights to keep fit but soon realised she was good enough to enter the Midlands Championships in Worcester in October last year. After qualifying with ease she then went on to win three gold medals in her first ever British Championships in Stafford in February.

"Once in a while, a colossal chunk of ice breaks free from Antarctica's majestic landscape and drifts out into the ocean. In March, Nasa was able to capture this remarkable event from space during a process that was months in the making. The monster iceberg, larger than Manhattan, was spotted breaking away from West Antarctica's Getz Ice Shelf by the U.S. National Ice Center (NIC). Scroll down for video . Last month, Nasa captured a 17 miles (27km) long iceberg being born in the West Antarctica's Getz Ice Shelf. The image on the left shows the landscape before the iceberg broke three and on the right the monster berg floating in the ocean . Glaciers in the Amundsen Sea of west Antarctica are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels. Measuring 17 miles (27km) long, iceberg B-34 appears to have fractured and moved out into in the Amundsen Sea sometime in mid- to late-February 2015, Nasa said. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) on Nasa's Terra and Aqua satellites took images spanning the calving event. B-34 is the 34th iceberg from the 'B' quadrant of Antarctica to be tracked by the NIC. The new berg is still smaller, however, than the much older B-15T- a fragment of B-15 that initially broke off from the Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000. The first image (left) shows the iceberg on February 16, when it was still attached to the ice shelf. By February 28 (middle), it appears to have separated somewhat. By March 5 (right), it is floating freely . B-34 is the 34th iceberg from the 'B' quadrant of Antarctica to be tracked by the NIC. Glaciers in this region are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels . Large icebergs can have large-scale impacts on the Southern Ocean. For example, as the bergs melt, the addition of cold, fresh water to the saltwater ocean can affect ocean currents and circulation. Researchers have shown, however, that even more fresh water comes from the melting of smaller and much more numerous bergs. The Amundsen Sea has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the West Antarctic. A study published in December suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago. Researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in West Antarctica, which contain enough water to raise sea levels by at least a metre, may be irreversible. The findings of the 21-year study by Nasa and the University of California, Irvine claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Scientists found the rate by taking radar, laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers' mass between 1992 and 2013. They found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year (91.5 billion U.S. tons), or the equivalent of losing the water weight of Mount Everest every two years. Scientists

"Rima Karak has won wide-spread support after defending herself against Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i . A female Lebanese TV host has won wide-spread support after standing her ground against an Islamist scholar following his sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i for Lebanon's Al Jadeed on the weekend of International Women’s Day, discussing reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. In the footage, Karaki urges Sheik Al-Seba'i to get back to the issues being faced in the present day, and asks him another question, a request which sparks a heated argument. 'It was at its peak during the 1970s, with the leftist revolutionary movement,' he says. 'Back then, we saw leftist organisation like the Red Brigades in Italy, the Red Army in Germany, the Baader Meinhof Group ...' Karaki tries to get Al-Seba'i back on topic, asking him to 'focus on the present'. She asks: 'At present, what slogans are used to attract (Christians) to these groups?' But Dr Al Seba’i becomes angry and abruptly replies: 'Listen, don't cut me off. I will answer as I please.' He then raises his voice, adding: 'I will not answer the way you like, because I’m here to serve the idea in which I believe.' Karaki politely explains that they have limited time on the show, but Al-Seba'i refuses to listen, telling the TV host he would not be interrupted and that he will answer as he pleases. Lebanese TV host Rima Karaki is being praised on social media for her cool reaction to sexist comments made by Sheik Al-Seba'i on a live interview . The host then lets the scholar know exactly who's in charge. 'In this studio, I run the show,' Karaki says. It provokes an angry reaction from Al-Seba'i. 'Are you done?' he says. 'Shut up so I can talk. 'It's beneath me to be interviewed by you. You are a woman who...' 'If you are going to elaborate so much, we won’t have time for other questions. 'Now, it’s up to you. If we have time, you will answer all the questions,' she says. Dr Al Seba'i replies: “You can decide as much as you like, but I will do whatever I want.' Rima Karaki asserts her authority over the situation as Sheik Al-Seba'i starts to get worked up . London-based Sheik Al-Seba'i then rudely tells the TV host to shut up as he carries on talking over her . With her palm facing the Sheikh, Karaki then delivers the ultimate end to the conversation. 'How can a respected Sheik like yourself tell a TV host to shut up?' she asks. 'Either there is mutual respect or the conversation is over.' The studio cameras then switch back to the studio leaving the Sheik in the dark. Karaki later posted a video of the conversation on her Twitter feed, which has gone viral and received widespread support. It has had 2.3million views on YouTube. Ania Sowinski tweeted: 'The awesome

"Mark Robson, 44, had half his foot amputated after he cut it while swimming on a holiday to Egypt . A father lost half his foot and all his toes after cutting himself in a swimming pool while on holiday. Mark Robson suffered a serious bone infection in the years after the injury, forcing doctors to operate. He had to give up his job after the accident as can no longer drive and struggles with basic household tasks. The 44-year-old had been swimming in a pool in the popular Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh when he gashed his toe. Despite the injury healing quickly, when Mr Robson returned to the UK medics said he had a bone infection and prescribed antibiotics. But in the five years after the accident, the infection returned repeatedly and doctors were forced to carry out a series of operations. They eventually had to amputate half his foot and his toes, leaving him needing to be cared for by his family. As a result, he launched legal proceedings against Thomson's Tropicana Jasmine Hotel, where he was injured. He has now won a £25,000 payout to help with everyday life, and is now calling on Thomson to improve safety measures at its resorts. The father-of-one, of Shiremoor, North Tyneside, said: 'The impact this whole issue has had on me has been devastating. 'As well as having no choice but to leave work, I now need assistance with basic household tasks and I can't drive – so am almost entirely reliant on my wife, family and friends. 'I have completely lost my independence as I cannot bear weight on my leg. 'The holiday to the Tropicana Jasmine Hotel has become memorable for all of the wrong reasons. 'I just hope that no-one else faces what I have been through, which is why tour operators and resorts have to make sure that the safety of holidaymakers is a top priority.' Mr Robson and his wife Gillian's holiday in August 2010 was the first time the couple had been on away since their honeymoon 16 years earlier. Just one day into the holiday Mr Robson felt a pain in his right foot and noticed it was bleeding as he stepped out of the pool. He said: 'I realised I must have caught it on the lining of the pool, which was quite sharp and had what seemed to be a rough concrete surface. 'I got it bandaged up but thought it would heal fairly quickly like a standard wound. 'It stopped me from swimming for the rest of the holiday and also stopped us going on an excursion or two, but ultimately I didn't think there would be any lasting damage.' When he returned to the UK, medics at a walk-in centre told him his toe may be infected so he went to Sunderland Royal Hospital and was prescribed antibiotics. Mr Robson underwent an operation in 2012 to remove all of his toes and part of his bone from his right foot. He says this has left him unable to drive and

"Roy Hodgson dismissed the failure of any Premier League club to reach the Champions League quarter finals this season by saying; 'It's a fact of life, these things happen some times'. The England manager spoke at a press conference on Thursday after announcing his squad ahead of this month's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and friendly with Italy - with a debut call for Tottenham striker Harry Kane being the most notable inclusion. The Three Lions boss was asked if he was concerned that no English team has reached the last eight of Europe's elite competition for the second time in three years - putting pressure on the number of places they will be granted in the future. England manager Roy Hodgson has announced his England squad for Euro 2016 clash with Lithuania . The Three Lions boss claimed not to be concerned by English clubs' failure i Europe this season . Hodgson said that the current problem was 'not endemic' but simply 'these things happen sometimes' 'The Premier League won't want to lose their fourth spot in the competition and the clubs won't want that because the Champions League is a major target for them when they start the season. 'Unfortunately, its a fact of life that if you want your four places, you need to get the points to keep your status high. 'I don't think it's endemic that we've had teams going out. 'Manchester City came up against Barcelona. Arsenal were fantastic in their second game against Monaco but weren't able to turn it around. Chelsea and PSG were unbelievably close in the two games - nobody would have complained should Chelsea have gone through instead of PSG. Manchester City became the last Premier League side out of Europe, losing to Lionel Messi's Barcelona . Hodsgon said that no one would have questioned if Chelsea had come through instead of PSG . Arsenal fought bravely in return leg against Monaco but paid the price for a poor home tie . 'Its a fact of live, these things happen sometimes. There will be other times when all four teams get through and we'l be saying we were a bit lucky because the opponents were just as good. 'Its a very high standard of football. I feel sorry for the mangers going into these games because we can underestimate the quality of teams in these other leagues and there's no God given right to get through. 'The Premier League is is a great league, we have great teams and great players but that doesn't give us a right to win against other teams from other countries.

'How can you tell me that a manager goes and watches Man United against Tottenham, the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes, the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for England and Ashley Young doesn't get in the squad?' Townsend later tweeted to his 285,000 followers: 'Not bad for a player that should be 'nowhere near the squad' ay @PaulMerse?' And Merson insisted on Wednesday he was pleased to be proven wrong by the 23-year-old. Merson told Sky Sports: 'It's just a matter of opinion, and my opinion was that he got pulled off after half an hour at Manchester United in front of Roy Hodgson, so he shouldn't have been in the squad. 'But fair play to him, I only give my opinion, and sometimes I'm wrong, other times I'm right. 'When I'm wrong, I hold my hands up. I don't have a problem with doing that - I'll always be the first to admit when I'm wrong. 'It's not as though I was watching hoping he wouldn't score for England, I'm genuinely pleased for him and fair play to him – it was a great goal.

"This is the heart-stopping moment two robbers pointed a gun at a family and their toddler during a corner-shop raid, before throwing sweets at them when they refused to hand over cash. Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, burst into the Londis shop in Cleveleys near Blackpool in October last year while the owner, his wife, and their toddler were behind the counter. The pair then pulled out a 'realistic looking' handgun and began waving it in the family's faces, demanding cash from the till, but the brave parents refused to hand it over. Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, raided a corner shop in Cleveleys near Blackpool using a 'realistic looking' handgun,pointing it at the owner, his wife, and their toddler as they hid behind the counter . When the mother and father refused to hand over cash, Munro and Thompson threw sweets at them before storming out empty handed . At that point, CCTV footage shows Munro and Thompson began throwing handfuls of sweets at the couple behind the counter, before fleeing empty handed. The duo were tracked down, and at Preston Crown Court on Wednesday Munro was jailed for five years and four months, while Thompson was sentenced to three years and four months. After the sentencing police said the attack was 'extremely distressing' for the family, who had been 'left in fear of their lives' during the raid. Detective Inspector Gareth Willis, from Lancashire Police, said: 'It's just incredibly brave of them not to give them what they wanted. 'The victims have been extremely brave in what must have been a terrifying incident for them both. Munro (left) was jailed for five years at Preston Crown Court for robbery, possessing a firearm and burglary, while Thompson was jailed for three years and four months for robbery and firearms offences . Police said the victims had been left 'extremely distressed' during the raid, and had been 'left in fear of their lives' as the gun was waved in their face . 'The female actually had her baby with her in the store when she was threatened with the weapon, which makes the offenders' actions even more reprehensible.' Detective Constable Paul Morris, from the same force, added: 'This was a terrifying ordeal for the two shop owners and their young child who were left in fear of their lives after being threatened with what they believed to be a real firearm. 'Munro and Thompson caused extreme distress for the victims involved and I hope that the sentences send a warning to criminals that crimes of this nature are treated seriously by both the police and the courts as well as bringing some closure for the victims.'

"Australia captain Michael Clarke bids farewell to one-day international cricket on Sunday — to save himself for one more shot at humiliating England. The 33-year-old has decided to retire from the 50-over game after steering his country to the World Cup final, with the sole intention of leading the Aussies into this summer’s Ashes showdown in England. ‘A priority for me is to continue to be successful in the Test format,’ said Clarke. ‘I think by walking away from one-day cricket it probably gives me my best opportunity.’ Michael Clarke shakes hands with New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum ahead of Sunday's final . And that spells danger for England with Clarke hungrier than ever to finally win an away Ashes series, having lost on all three of his previous trips. Clarke scored two centuries guiding Australia to their 5-0 whitewash of Alastair Cook’s dismal team last winter, but he’s desperate to break his duck in England in what will almost certainly be his last Ashes away tour. ‘I’ve never hid behind the fact that I find Test cricket to be the pinnacle of our sport,’ said Clarke, who has won 108 Test caps including 30 against England. The 33-year-old made the surprise announcement at a press conference on Saturday morning . ‘I’ve never gone down that road anyway in regard to what is the best thing to do for the public interest, as I’m sure you would have seen through my career, I’ve copped my fair share of smacks in the mouth. ‘But I am whoI am and it’s about being true to myself and I don’t feel bad about saying I believe Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. I love that challenge, I find it extremely difficult every Test match I play. I do see it as the pinnacle. I still think I’ve got a lot to offer the team as captain of the Australian Test team, and I want to make sure I continue to have success in that format.’ Clarke was made captain in all formats when Ricky Ponting stood down following the 2011 World Cup. He will be making his 245th one-day appearance for Australia and his 75th as skipper on Sunday as Australia take on New Zealand, led by Brendon McCullum (inset). George Bailey and Steve Smith are thought to be the two men most likely to succeed Clarke in captaining the Aussies. Clarke made his ODI debut 12 years ago and has scored almost 8,000 runs for his country . Clarke, who will continue to play at Test level, is pictured playing a shit in the nets ahead of Sunday's match . Clarke, pictured with team-mate Shane Watson, will lead Australia against England in the Ashes later this year .

"Scottish Labour MPs are defying Ed Miliband by telling voters on the doorstep they would not support a post-election deal with the SNP. In an indication of a growing split in the party over its election strategy, several MPs are indicating that they would not be prepared to back any arrangement with Scottish Nationalists after May. Some are even said to be threatening to quit the party rather than be part of an administration propped up by the SNP, which wants to break up the UK. Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing a rebellion in Scotland over his plan to do a post-election deal with the SNP . Despite pressure from shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, Mr Miliband has repeatedly refused to rule out relying on the votes of SNP MPs to enable a Labour government to take power if he fails to win a Commons majority. There is rising Labour panic at polls suggesting the Scottish Nationalists are heading for a landslide victory north of the border – picking up dozens of MPs at the expense of Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The latest suggest that the SNP could win as many as 50 of Scotland’s 59 seats, including Labour strongholds currently held by Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling. That would mean Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond holding the balance of power at Westminster, threatening a constitutional crisis. One Scottish Labour MP said: ‘Labour MPs on the doorstep are saying “if you vote for us we won’t do a deal with the SNP”. The group are united. I’m not aware of a colleague who is advocating against that position.’ Another MP said: ‘There’s no prospect of any deal with the SNP and I’m making that clear on the doorstep. ‘But I don’t want to be focusing on the issue of deals, and I understand why it hasn’t been ruled out [by Mr Miliband]. We would end up getting diverted into a campaign that’s all about deals, rather than our key message which is that we can have a Labour majority government.’ In constituencies where there was a strong No vote in last year’s independence referendum, or where there are large numbers of middle-class Scots who traditionally vote Lib Dem or Tory, Labour’s candidates are now telling people on the doorstep there will be no pact with the SNP. The move – in defiance of Mr Miliband’s official stance - is designed to encourage tactical voting towards Labour. But in more working-class areas such as the west of Scotland where the independence campaign performed better, MPs fear ruling out a deal could make voters leaning towards the Nationalists ‘more bloody-minded’. Ian Davidson, Labour chairman of the Commons Scottish affairs committee ruled out a deal with the SNP . Ian Davidson, the Labour chairman of the Commons Scottish affairs committee, is among those who insists any deal with the SNP is ‘simply not credible’. ‘They are simply not trustworthy,’ he said.

"Aubrey de Grey (pictured) says ageing is a 'disease that can and should be cured' With his Rasputin beard and lines etched deep into his forehead, Aubrey de Grey looks like a man a lot older than his 51 years. A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing. But you would be wrong. For de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age. It sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet. PayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth £1.5 billion) donated £2.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing. While many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing. Google's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.' One source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.' De Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him £11 million when she died in 2011 – £9 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow. Scroll down for video . 'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, ""We were with you all along"".' De Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car – 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'. His argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body

"Royal Mail has been accused by MPs of using its universal service commitment as an excuse to raise stamp prices. First and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues. An influential committee of MPs said that if Royal Mail wanted to increase profits, it must invest in new technology and focus on efficiency, rather than simply increase prices. First and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee, said he was ‘not very pleased’ to hear they had taken the ‘easy option’ of raising stamp prices. Citizens Advice Bureau also urged Royal Mail to ‘focus on making efficiency savings rather than relying upon raising prices’ and expressed concern that consumers were held to ransom because they ‘have no choice but to pay the increased prices’. The cost of posting a large letter weighing up to 100g first class will rise by 2p to 95p. Royal Mail has warned it faces aggressive competition in the parcels market from delivery firm Whistl and called for regulators to rein in its rivals. The company says it is at a disadvantage to competitors because it must fulfil a 175-year-old ‘universal service’ obligation to deliver to all UK addresses for the same price. It said this obligation, which requires it to deliver six days a week to even the most rural communities, could soon become ‘financially unsustainable’ if Ofcom does not impose restrictions on its rivals. But the Business Committee will say today that there is no ‘immediate risk’ to the service and that, far from being a ‘burden’, the service brings ‘revenue and status’ to Royal Mail. A new report says: ‘Royal Mail should not increase postal and packaging prices simply in an attempt either to increase its own profit levels or to protect the Universal Service Obligation, without increasing the efficiency of its operations. ‘While we accept that Royal Mail has done much to improve efficiency, it still has to match the technical innovations introduced by many competitors — innovations that more clearly match the expectations of consumers.’ Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee, said he was ‘not very pleased’ to hear they had taken the ‘easy option’ of raising stamp prices . John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the rise in stamp prices would be unwelcome for many companies. He said: ‘While prices have only gone up by a penny, this still represents an above inflation rise. ‘Businesses affected will still have to decide whether to absorb this rise or pass it on to their customers.’ They said they expected Royal mail to use the additional money raised ‘to invest in improving their performance and meet delivery targets’. Mr Allan added: ‘Ofcom should carefully monitor how Royal Mail is doing, and use their powers to fine should customers’

"A Missouri mother believes her three-year-old daughter with special needs was discriminated against after finding out the child was forced to take off her thick glasses for a school portrait. Abby Lubiewski was born with Hallerman-Streiff, a rare genetic syndrome that resulted in congenital cataracts. She can only perceive light and dark when she's not wearing her specs. 'She has no vision at all without her glasses,' her mother Amanda Lubiewski told Fox 2 Now. When Lubiewski received her daughter Abby's photographs, she immediately saw that her child's smile was strained. Scroll down for video . Abby Lubiewski's mother Amanda was outraged after finding out her three-year-old daughter with special needs was forced to take her thick glasses off for school picture day . When Lubiewski received her daughter Abby's photographs, she immediately saw that her child's smile was strained and said it was because Abby 'couldn't see' 'I knew then that she couldn't see,' she said. 'And I couldn't quite comprehend what would be going through someone's mind to ask her to take those off.' Lubiewski wrote a post on Facebook about how her daughter 'loves her glasses' and 'needs them to function to the best of her ability,' Yahoo! Parenting reported. 'She is a strong, confident girl and deserves to show off every beautiful part of her, including her glasses.' Lubiewski said that when Abby saw her school photo she asked, 'What happened to my glasses?' But the mother was even more concerned knowing that official school portraits are released to the public if a child goes missing. 'This is very unsafe for her,' she told Fox 2 Now. 'Her picture doesn't look like her without glasses.'

'This is very unsafe for her,' she said. 'Her picture doesn't look like her without glasses' Lubiewski contacted LifeTouch School Photography on Facebook and told them 'how disrespectful' the family thought it was for the company to treat Abby 'differently than other children in the school'. 'Photographers for school pictures need to be trained on how to capture each unique child,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Even those with disabilities.' Lubiewski said other photographers in the past have been able to work around the glare Abby's thick specs can sometimes cause for the camera. Two pictures of Abby wearing glasses were taken by the photographer, but she wasn't looking at the camera. 'It's not just about getting a cute picture of her,' the mother said. 'It's how she was treated, and how it seems like she was treated differently because there was a part of her that was difficult to photograph.' LifeTouch

"Nigel Farage this morning rejected claims he has been ‘sent by God’ to save Britain from the European Union – insisting: ‘I’m not the Messiah, I’m a very naughty boy.’ The Ukip leader’s remarks, echoing one of the most famous lines from Monty Python's Life of Brian, came after he was played a clip of a documentary aired this week featuring one of his more obsessive fans. Former nurse Jill said Mr Farage ‘probably didn’t realise it’ but had been ‘sent to protect us against the EU’. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage this morning insisted he was not the 'Messiah', adding: 'I'm a very naughty boy' The 59-year old dominatrix, from Poole in Dorset, told the Channel 5 documentary ‘Farage Fans and Ukip Lovers’ that Brussels wanted to install microchips in everyone – and would send people to the guillotine if they refused. She said Mr Farage, 50, was Britain’s only hope. 'God says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood, I'll send someone to give you some protection.' Jill added: 'I think Nigel Farage is sent to protect us against the EU, he wants to bring England back to the English people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders.' 'What Nigel Farage will do by getting us out of the EU is to stop their plans to microchip our people. 'The EU already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in China, equipped with guillotines. 'They will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed. So off with your head and that's when things start getting unpleasant.' Played the clip on LBC this morning Mr Farage insisted he was not placed on Earth to save Britain from Brussels. In Monty Python's Life of Brian, the hapless Brian, played by Graham Chapman (right), is hailed the Messiah - but his mother, played by Terry Jones (left) tells his followers: 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy' The cult 1979 film follows the rise of Brian Cohen, who was born on the same day as Jesus and is mistaken as the Messiah . He said: ‘Jill, I’m sure, is an absolutely delightful woman, but I have to disappoint her. Jill, I’m not the Messiah, I’m a very naughty boy.’ Jill - who says she once saw an angel in Tesco Express - doesn't just think Farage will save the nation with his foreign policies. She also believes UKIP is helping Brits become more liberated in the bedroom. She's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many UKIP supporters who share her fondness for S&M. She said: 'I would love a cabinet position as head of bondage. It's my hobby and I do enjoy it, it's all role-play and froth, it's a natural English phenomenon to like it. 'Sometimes I like to be submissive and other times dominant. I have met a lot of UKIP supporters who are into BDSM. They do seem to have a natural bent

"A video taken from the point of view of a train driver captures a ride on the highest railway in Europe, the Jungfrau. The time lapse footage speeds along the 9km long electrified track, which leads from Kleine Scheidegg to Jungraujoch and stands at an elevation of 2061m and 3454m respectively. Opening in a tunnel built into a Swiss mountain, the train careers towards the light and out onto the snowy slopes to race alongside the many skiers. Turning a corner, the train moves at a slow and steady pace – the track barely visible from under the snow. Two people quickly cross the track in front of the train as it begins picking up speed and passes alongside a ledge that looks down on chalets below. The video then shows the train beginning its descent of the mountain, passing very close to a number of skiers who make their own way to the bottom of the slope. The video opens inside a tunnel build into the Swiss mountain as the train makes its way along the 9km long electrified track . Turning right the train enters another tunnel and plunges back into darkness before re-emerging next to even more skiers. Suddenly the train begins travelling even faster as the banks of snow rise up higher alongside it. Like a bobsleigh the train hurtles down the track as the settlement at the bottom of the mountain slowly comes into view. The train emerges into the light and passes very close to a number of skiers who make their own way to the bottom of the slope . The train turns right to enter another tunnel and plunges back into darkness before re-emerging next to even more skiers .

A number of people can be seen crossing the track ahead as the train pulls into the station. The video concludes with the train finally arriving and making a controlled stop. The video concludes with the train picking up speed and hurtling down the track like a bobsleigh before arriving at the station . The Jungfrau railway runs almost entirely within the Jungfrau Tunnel, built into the Eiger and Mönch mountains, and contains a total of five stations.

"A beautiful snowy owl has been captured scouring a snow-covered field in the hunt for food. Her piercing yellow eyes were the only thing that stood out against the white landscape in Ottawa, Canada. Once locked on to a vole she swooped just inches above the surface waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. The stunning set of images was captured by photographer Rick Dobson. A beautiful snowy owl was captured gliding inches above a snow-covered field in Ottawa, Canada, in the hunt for food, with her bright yellow eyes just visible above the wing . The 57-year-old said: 'She had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill. 'Snowy owls are diurnal so they hunt and are active both during the day and night. 'When they are resting they often sit in a snow-covered field motionless, making themselves very hard to spot. 'When they are hunting they will perch on a lump in a field, a fence post, or a hydro-pole where they have a lookout from which to spot their prey.' As the owl came over the top of a ledge she pulled her wings back so she could soar across the field . The stunning set of images was captured by photographer Rick Dobson who said: 'She had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill' The owl flew silently just millimetres above the snow-covered floor, keeping her bright eyes on the prey . To get close enough to the owls, Mr Dobson had to make sure he approached slowly and did not walk directly towards the birds. He said: 'Every winter I go out with my binoculars and scan the farmers' fields to see if I can locate wintering snowy owls. 'When I locate an owl I have to spend time slowly approaching it to get within a good distance to take photographs. When the owl got close enough she used her sharp talons to catch her prey. Snowy owls will usually fly a short distance before landing to eat . Snowy owls often approach their prey from a low angle to ensure a shadow does not give the game away . 'Some owls are much more approachable than others. 'Upon repeated visits the owls come to realise that I am not a threat and will ignore me, providing I move slowly, and carry on with its business.' Mr Dobson described the owls as 'one of the most magnificent creatures on earth'. 'I think of them as snow ghosts or snow angels,' he said. 'They are very large birds but fly silently and gracefully and can endure the harshest of habitats. Happy with its work: Mr Dobson added: 'Snowy owls are one of the most magnificent creatures on earth'. The beautiful bird is pictured after the hunt .

An 83-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer who was left with horrific injuries after 'pure scum' burglars stormed her home and attacked her was beaten so badly that her family feared she was dead. Zallu Hassan suffered severe facial injuries including a broken cheekbone and jaw and a fractured eye socket after the gang stormed her home in Ilford, Essex. Her devastated daughter, Tulay Ahmadi, 46, believes the intruders kicked her mother's head and stamped on her face during the attack overnight on March 9. Mrs Ahmadi, who raised the alarm after arriving at her mother's house and finding her in a pool of blood, is now offering a £10,000 reward for anyone who has information leading to the arrest of the offenders. She said: 'The people who did this are pure scum. 'They're so evil they'd probably do this to their own mothers.' 'My poor mum was so bad that we thought she was dead when we saw the blood coming out of her ears.' Mrs Hassan, who lives on her own, was attacked sometime between 6pm on March 9 and 8am the following morning. Mrs Ahmadi said the family are now trying to establish what was stolen as the house was ransacked but her mother has 'nothing of real value' and nothing obvious is missing. She said: 'They're just animals - any human being who has any kind of respect would not do this. 'If I could I would inflict the same pain onto them 10 times over. It's just horrific.

Mrs Ahmadi said: 'My mum was very mobile but I feel this has definitely advanced her Alzheimer's - she's become very reclusive since she was attacked.

"Scientists are virtually certain that California will be rocked by a strong earthquake in the next 30 years. Now they say the risk of a mega-quake is more likely than previously thought. The chance of a magnitude-8 quake striking the state in the next three decades jumped to 7 per cent from 4.7 per cent, mainly because scientists took into account the possibility that several faults can shake at once, releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction. While the risk of a mega-quake is higher than past estimates, it's more likely - greater than 99 per cent chance - that California will be rattled by a magnitude-6.7 jolt similar in size to the 1994 Northridge disaster. Brace: A new U.S. Geological Survey report has increased the likelihood of a magnitude-8 earthquake hitting California over the next 30 years. Above, a photo of an overpass that collapsed in the 1994 magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake . The chance of a Northridge-size quake was slightly higher in Northern California than Southern California - 95 per cent versus 93 per cent, according to a report released Tuesday by the U.S. Geological Survey. 'California is earthquake country, and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one,' USGS geophysicist and lead author Ned Field said. The latest seismic calculations largely mirror previous findings issued by the USGS in 2008. Back then, scientists also determined that California faced an almost certain risk of experiencing a Northridge-size quake. The new report included newly discovered fault zones and the possibility that a quake can jump from fault to fault. Because of this knowledge, the odds of a catastrophic quake - magnitude 8 or larger - in the next 30 years increased. There is a 93 per cent chance of a magnitude 7 or larger occurring over the same period and a 48 per cent chance of a magnitude 7.5 - similar to previous estimates. Thousands of quakes every year hit California, sandwiched between two of Earth's major tectonic plates, the Pacific and North American plates. Most are too small to be felt. Of the more than 300 faults that crisscross the state, the southern segment of the San Andreas Fault - which runs from central California to the Salton Sea near the U.S.-Mexico border - remains the greatest threat because it hasn't ruptured in more than three centuries. The report found there is a 19 per cent chance in the next 30 years that a Northridge-size quake will unzip the southern section compared to a 6.4 per cent chance for the northern section, partly because it last broke in 1906. The southern San Andreas is 'ready to have an earthquake because it's really locked and loaded,' Field said. The report is a forecast, but it is not a prediction. Experts still cannot predict exactly where or when a quake will hit anywhere in the world. In recent years, the USGS and several universities have been testing an early warning system designed to detect the first waves of a jolt and send out an alert

"A hero pilot pulled his plane out of a terrifying North Sea nosedive with just seven seconds to spare. The plane began to plunge after it was struck by lightning, but autopilot ignored the pilot’s commands to climb and tried to crash the plane into the sea. The airliner pitched down, falling at 9,500ft a minute, and fell to just 1,100ft above the ocean before its commander wrestled back control just moments before it was about to crash into the icy water. The Loganair flight was just seconds from crashing into the north sea before its commander saved the day . The 42-year-old pilot put out a Mayday emergency signal before regaining control and saving his 30 passengers and three crew just moments before the plane plunged into the sea. The island-hopping Loganair flight from Aberdeen to Shetland was put off its approach by thunderstorms, snow, hail and 70mph winds on the evening of December 15. A ball of lightning then appeared outside the cockpit and a lightning bolt struck the Saab 2000 plane’s nose, and then travelled the full length of the aircraft before leaving its tail. The aircraft landed safely in Aberdeen with only minor damage and no injuries. An AAIB probe discovered that the autopilot on the Loganair Saab 2000 G-LGNO had remained engaged and the pilot’s actions were countered by the system, causing the dive. No technical problems were found with the aircraft, which is now back in service, and pilot training is now included simulations of the incident according to the AAIB report.

"Manchester City go into Wednesday night's Champions League game against Barcelona knowing that only a win - and a win in which they score twice - will be enough to secure progress. It might therefore worry them to know that beating Barcelona is something that their manager, Manuel Pellegrini, has failed to manage since 2008. Pellegrini has now managed three clubs without any successes against Barca, losing all of his games so far as manager of City to match his record at Real Madrid, and managing just a single draw when in charge of Malaga. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has lost 12 of his last 13 games against Barcelona . The last time Pellegrini beat Barcelona, in 2008, Yaya Toure was playing for the Spanish club . In fact, you have to go back to March 2008, more than eight years ago, to find Pellegrini's last win over Barcelona, on a day that his star man Yaya Toure was lining up for the Nou Camp outfit. As Villarreal boss Pellegrini did manage four wins against Barca, while drawing three times and losing the remaining five of his twelve games. However, only the last of those wins came away from home, and none of them in the Champions League, while his career record against Barcelona sees him triumph only 16 per cent of the time. City know they need to produce something special to progress - if they do beat Luis Enrique's team by the required margin, it will not just be a remarkable achievement for the club, but also for their manager. City trail 2-1 going into their game at the Nou Camp after Luis Suarez's double at the Etihad stadium . Pellegrini has lost all of his three matches against Barca as Manchester City manager .

"Behind the highly-publicized trial of murderer Aaron Hernandez has played out a painful and private feud between two sisters. Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, 25, sobbed and hugged the killer's mom in the Massachusetts court on Wednesday as the jury returned a guilty verdict for first-degree murder, sending the ex-NFL star to prison for life with no chance of release. Just feet away across the aisle in the packed courtroom, sat her 23-year-old sister, Shaneah Jenkins, the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd who Hernandez executed with five bullets on June 17, 2013. The once-close sisters, who shared an apartment in their native Bristol, Connecticut, have not spoken since it became clear that Hernandez had a role in Lloyd's brutal death. Scroll down for video .

Torn apart: Shayanna Jenkins (pictured right) and her younger sister Shaneah (left) in their senior yearbook photo from 2007 at Bristol Central High School, Connecticut. The two sisters were close until Aaron Hernandez's murder of Odin Lloyd left them on opposite sides of a murder trial . The girlfriend of Odin Lloyd (circled, bottom left) dabbed her eyes with a tissue as she sat across the aisle from her estranged sister and Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, who sobbed and hugged the former NFL player's mother Terri (top right) when the guilty verdict was announced . Shayanna Jenkins left the courtroom immediately after the guilty verdict on Wednesday morning and was seen driving away in her car, eyes shielded by sunglasses. She did not wait to hear the victim impact statement of Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, who said that she had forgiven those who 'had a hand in my son's murder both before and after'. The mother also spoke of how her son Odin introducing her to his girlfriend Shaneah had been 'a gift' in her life. Shaneah did not speak before the court but placed a comforting hand on Ms Ward when she spoke to media outside. The Jenkins sisters, who introduced the men, both attended the trial at times, sitting on opposite sides without exchanging a word, their rift on full display. Shayanna sat behind Hernandez, 25, and could be seen joking with him, several times exchanging whispered 'I love yous' when she attended. Shaneah sat with Lloyd's family. Before he was killed, she and Lloyd, 27, had made plans to move in together while she attended law school in Boston. Both sisters took the stand during the two-and-a-half-month murder trial in Fall River, Massachusetts. When Shaneah took the stand against Hernandez, her sister sat in the front row, supporting the former Pats star and father of her two-year-old daughter, Avielle. The sisters, for a time, took similar paths, according to Shaneah's testimony. The women grew up together in Bristol, Connecticut, and both attended Bristol Central High School. They have a 16-year-old younger sister. Shayanna had an on-and-off relationship with Hernandez that spanned the last two years of high school. When Hernandez went off

"A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h). The Maglev train completed a test run on a track in Yamanashi, beating the previous record of 361mph (580km/h) set in 2003. Another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow, and engineers at the Central Japan Railway Company predict it could reach 373mph (600km/h). Scroll down for video . A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h) Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. The seven-car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h), which will cut the journey time for a 178-mile journey by more than half. For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h). The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time. Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964 . It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr). It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027 . China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (£830million) to build. Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe. Andy Kunz, president

Broner throws an uppercut at John Molina Jnr during their fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in March . Broner has his arm raised after comfortably beating Molina Jnr on points in Las Vegas . Broner, a huge admirer of Floyd 'Money' Mayweather, recently stirred up controversy when he called a $40million contract offer from Jay Z and his Roc Nation 'bull****'. 50 Cent said Broner was disrespectful of Jay Z and should have accepted the offer. 'That wasn't a good idea to say that. 40 million, he should take it,' 50 Cent told TMZ. Broner had told TMS Sports he didn't appreciate receiving the offer via email: 'The capacity of the contract was $40 million for five years, that's just bull****… Like I wanted to tell him, and hopefully this get to him, stop sending your workers to come talk to me. I'm a boss, man. Bosses talk to bosses.'

"Marouane Fellaini struck twice as Belgium moved within three points of Euro 2016 Group B qualifying leaders Wales with a 5-0 thumping of Cyprus on Saturday. After a win and two draws from their first three matches, Belgium knew the pressure was on to produce a performance befitting a side ranked fourth in the world. 'The players enjoyed themselves and knew what to do. Yes, I'm satisfied,' Belgian coach Marc Wilmots told reporters.

The hosts, who reached the quarter-finals of last year's World Cup, were 2-0 up at halftime although they could easily have been four or five ahead against a packed but often porous Cypriot defence. Manchester United midfielder Fellaini opened Belgium's account midway through the first half after the visitors failed to clear a corner. A cross by Eden Hazard then set up Christian Benteke to make it 2-0 in the 35th minute. Fellaini found the top corner with a perfectly placed long-range strike in the 66th minute but that effort was matched a minute later by Hazard. With two defenders in front of him, the Chelsea playmaker shifted cleverly to the right before curling the ball into the net off the inside of the far post. Debutant Michy Batshuayi completed the demolition in the 80th minute after the hard-working Radja Nainggolan dispossessed a defender. Fellaini is congratulated by his Belgium team-mates after scoring the opening goal of the night . Vincent Kompany (left) and Fellaini celebrate after the latter got the ball rolling against Cyprus on Saturday . Cyprus, who beat Bosnia 2-1 in September, were without six injured players and barely mounted an attack with a single off-target header in the second half proving their only threat.

"When 16-year-old Billy Flynn gunned down the husband of his high school instructor and lover, Pamela Smart, in 1990, the trial became an instant tabloid sensation. Its lurid details aired gavel-to-gavel on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle and spawned movies and books. Twenty-five years after Gregg Smart's killing, Pamela Smart remains in prison serving life without the possibility of parole and Flynn makes his first bid for parole Thursday, his 41st birthday. Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Smart's 1991 trial that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus credit for pretrial incarceration. Here's a look at some key details in the case: . Teacher: Pamela Smart (seen in this 1991 file photo) was convicted of conspiring with her 15 year-old lover, William 'Billy' Flynn, to kill her 24 year-old husband, Greggory Smart. Smart is serving a life without parole sentence . Student: In this 1991 file photo, William Flynn testifies on his 17th birthday how he shot Greggory Smart in the head and killed him. Flynn pleaded guilty to killing Smart and has a parole hearing scheduled for Thursday . The plot . According to trial testimony, Smart was 22 and one of Flynn's instructors in a self-awareness program at Winnicunnet High School in Hampton when she seduced the 15-year-old Flynn. She told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything, including her dog and furniture, if she divorced Gregg Smart as their wedding anniversary approached. Flynn said he and three cohorts bungled an attempt to kill Smart in April, when they got lost on the way there. But on May 1, 1990, he and 18-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. To this day, Pamela Smart denies knowing about the plot. But the state's star witness, a teenage intern in whom Smart confided, secretly recorded her after the killing saying, 'If you tell the (expletive) truth, you'll send me to the slammer for the rest of my (expletive) life.' Smart was convicted March 22, 1991, of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy and witness tampering. Randall got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released. Life in prison: Flynn (seen in January 2008) married while behind bars, has a teen stepdaughter and has earned his GED and electrician's helper license . Media circus: The trials's lurid details aired gavel-to-gavel on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle and spawned movies and books . Sensational trial .

"Brandon Marshall is to be traded for the third time in his NFL career and will join the New York Jets after three years with the Chicago Bears. The prodigiously talented wide receiver turns 31 this month, but the move had been widely touted. Deemed an outspoken maverick by many at Soldier Field, he raised eyebrows with a post-game locker room rant after defeat to the Miami Dolphins in October. His appearances as an analyst on 'Inside the NFL' weekly were also said to be a distraction. Brandon Marshall will head to New York on Tuesday for a medical ahead of his move to the Jets . The mercurial Marshall is yet to play in the play-offs . New head coach John Fox and offensive co-ordinator Adam Gase appeared lukewarm about Marshall at best. 'We’re trying to evaluate where everybody fits and how we best use them and, again, trying to put the best football team on the field. He’s part of that process,' Fox told the Chicago Tribune last month. Marshall was close to Jay Cutler - following him to Chicago from Denver via Miami - but raw quarterback Geno Smith could test his short fuse. ESPN broke news of the trade, which will also see the Jets give the Bears a fifth round draft pick. Marshall signed a four-year deal in Chicago last May, and had seven consecutive 1,000 yard seasons before falling short last year - largely due to missing the final three games with a shoulder complaint. Despite the numbers, Marshall is yet to appear in a play-off game. Perhaps that will change in New York. New head coach Todd Bowles was with Marshall during his two-year stint in Miami and will have been influential in the trade. The move will likely mean the end of Percy Harvin's short stint with the Gang Green, with Marshall to pair up with Eric Decker. Marshall was drafted in the fourth round of the 2006 draft by the Broncos and is a mental health spokesman, spreading awareness of his battle with Borderline Personality Disorder.

The highly usual situation was no coincidence, but rather a clever marketing ploy dreamed up by retailer Lord & Taylor to promote its edgy new fashion-forward range . The move proved an instant success as the $88 Paisley Asymmetrical Dress sold out almost immediately and created an online buzz for the range. To convince that many fashionistas - including Caitlin Lindquist and Rachel Lynch - to promote your new line is extremely rare but Lord & Taylor didn’t leave anything to chance and the company has admitted that it paid the bloggers to wear the paisley-print, handkerchief-hem summer dress. Adweek reports that the bloggers received ‘unspecified compensation’ in return for giving the dress their seal of approval. ‘The goal was to make [the potential customer] stop in her feed and ask why all her favorite bloggers are wearing this dress, and what is Design Lab? Using Instagram as that vehicle is a logical choice, especially when it comes to fashion,’ said Lord & Taylor's CMO Michael Crotty. Many of the posts generated more than 1,000 Likes each, with several surpassing 5,000 Likes and some reaching rarified levels like 13,000 Likes. Significantly, none of the bloggers were transparant on their Instagram feeds about the fact that Lord & Taylor had paid them to promote the dress.

In order to ensure maximum exposure for their new Design Lab collection, the company partnered with 50 of the most influential fashion bloggers and got each to post a photo of them wearing the same dress . The Lord & Taylor deal highlights the gray area of bloggers receiving payment for promoting some goods and services, while others they lend their credability to for free. While newspapers and websites such as the Daily Mail Online have to be upfront and clearly state when something is paid for content, the rules are less stringent on social media. Many celebrities now promote products and luxury brands via Twitter in return for either payment or freebies. Rap star Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan are among the famous names who have been paid by big businesses to promote products to

"A pensioner who went into hospital and came home to find her possessions had been cleared out has criticised her son who she says 'didn't think I was going to make it'. Pamela Clothier was admitted to hospital forcing her to leave her bungalow in Battle, Sussex. But the 92-year-old's family was under the impression she planned to sell the house and allowed charity Age UK to clear it out. Her beloved dog Mitzy was also taken to a local animal sanctuary and later re-homed. After returning to find the house empty, the great-grandmother has criticised the charity and her family. Scroll down for video . Pamela Clothier had to retrieve her possessions after she returned from hospital to find her house cleared . The 92-year-old says the worst thing was losing her dog, Mitzy, who was given to a local animal sanctuary . Mrs Clothier said: 'My son Peter didn't think I was going to make it, so he just upped and tried to sell everything. I can't believe he could be so cruel.' She added: 'They left me with nothing. All my furniture was gone, all my diaries, books, clothes, everything. The worst thing is that I can't get my dog back either.' She spoke about the incident after Age UK offered her an 'insulting' £1,000 compensation. She said: 'They did get me some of my furniture back, and I have been able to get more things from my friends, but I still feel like it's not my home any more. 'In my day I would have knocked the spots off anybody, but now I'm absolutely demolished.' Mrs Clothier has lived alone since her Bomber Command hero husband Clyde passed away in 1991. The fiercely independent nonagenarian added: 'I loved my home - it had masses of memories. I've got nothing now, not even my dog. 'Peter made up his mind that selling my property was the thing to do, and he got rid of the furniture that was clogging up the place. I was left effectively having to start my life over again.' Pamela Clothier says she was horrified when a charity cleared out her belongings without her permission . She said she did not explicitly permit the organisation to remove her belongings and wanted them back. The pensioner is calling for a change in the law to make it more difficult for charities to act in such a way without the homeowner's permission. 'I'm 92-years-old and I'm in a house which is almost empty,' said Mrs Clothier told the BBC's South East Today. 'All the work I've done, all the knitting and sewing I've done,all the things I've made are gone. It's just like I didn't exist,' she added through tears. Mrs Clothier's son Peter insists she knew what was happening and he saved many of her things . She said she was horrified the charity had carried out her son's instruction without checking with her first. 'I think they should be absolutely certain that the person who's holding the key has the right to be doing what

"A white supremacist who has been charged with three murders entered a plea of not guilty in court on Friday. Frazier Glenn Miller, 74, is charged with capital murder in the April 13, 2014, shootings at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas, and at the nearby Village Shalom Retirement Center. Miller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, is a Vietnam War veteran from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party. None of the victims of the 2014 shooting that took place on the eve of Passover, a week-long holiday in which the Jewish community celebrates their freedom from slavery in Egypt, were Jewish. Scroll down for video . Frazier Glenn Miller (above) entered a plea of not guilty for charges of capital murder in the killing of three individuals on April 13, 2014 . Miller, a supremacist, allegedly opened fire outside a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas screaming 'Heil Hitler!' Miller (mugsghot above), who says he is ill and does not have much time to live, also asked for a speedy trial . On Friday, Frazier also asked for a speedy trial and to have Internet access while he is in prison. The judge granted him the right to a speedy trial, which will begin August 17, but denied him Internet access. Miller said he would go to trial in 30 days if he could represent himself. Overland Park police Sgt. Marty C. Ingram testified earlier this month at a preliminary hearing that he heard shots fired at the Jewish Community Center and saw the doors of the center's theater shatter. He said he took cover as more shots hit the building's facade back on April 13. 'Dust, smoke was flying everywhere at that point,' he said. The gunman then drove away. When he heard that fellow officers had arrested a suspect, Ingram accompanied some witnesses to the arrest scene to determine if they could identify him. As they approached the patrol car where Miller was detained, he shouted 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed. Miller is accused of killing Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were attending a singing contest audition at the community center. He also is accused of killing 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the nearby Jewish retirement home. Miller (above in 80s) was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car . At a December hearing, Miller, who has emphysema, said he was afraid that he doesn't have much time left to live following a trip to the emergency room in March. Miller previously served three years in federal prison on weapons charges and for planning the killing of the Southern Poverty Law Center's founder. He was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the

"Samantha Cameron is to hit the campaign trail as part of a Tory strategy to keep her husband in Number 10. Conservative strategists believe the PM's wife could be a secret weapon in the battle for re-election on May 7. The couple appeared together yesterday in the first of many campaign visits, but David Cameron admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold. Scroll down for video . David and Samantha Cameron are to appear together regularly during the election campaign to woo floating voters . Mrs Cameron has secured a broadly positive press since moving into Number 10 five years ago, largely by keeping below the radar. Many of her appearances have been linked to her charities, including Save The Children, Comic Relief and Tickets For Troops. She has also championed the creative industries, hosting events in Downing Street to mark London Fashion Week. But she is now expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last week to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister. She said: 'He's definitely for my mind the best man for the job. 'I hope that me and the family help him to keep things in perspective - keep him grounded - help him to pace himself over the next eight weeks.'

"(CNN)Five full weeks into Aaron Hernandez's murder trial, prosecutors have called 77 witnesses. Jurors have yet to hear from the former NFL star's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick or owner Robert Kraft. But this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd in 2013. Check out some of the key moments you might have missed this week. A DNA analyst from the Massachusetts State Police crime lab said she found that Hernandez's DNA matched the DNA taken from a marijuana joint found near Lloyd's body at the crime scene. Lloyd's DNA also was found on the blunt. The DNA analyst, Diane Biagiotti, testified to finding a partial DNA match from Hernandez on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the Enterprise rental car office. But under cross-examination, lead defense attorney Jamie Sultan got Biagiotti to acknowledge there's a high likelihood that DNA from chewing gum could have transferred to the shell casing found in the dumpster. The office manager at the rental car office, Keelia Smyth, testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the Nissan Altima returned by Hernandez on June 17, 2013. She said she threw them in the trash bin outside of her office. Inside Hernandez's downward spiral . It was revealed by Sultan that the state never submitted the gum for DNA testing. The state has not yet explained why. We may hear the answer during the state's redirect of Biagiotti on Monday. Hernandez is seen on surveillance video buying gum, and he also offered some to Smyth. Biagiotti said under cross-examination that it's highly unlikely to find DNA on any shell casing. One reason is because the heat from the gun wipes away any DNA, she said. The shell casings found at the crime scene did not have enough DNA on them to produce a DNA profile. Hernandez's family was in court on Friday after a week's absence. Hernandez's mother, Terri Hernandez, told CNN' that she thought Friday ""went very well"" for him. Testimony this week also focused on fingerprints from Hernandez and Lloyd that were found inside the rented Nissan Altima. The car also had fingerprints of Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are also charged with killing Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. State Trooper David Mackin, a fingerprint expert with the Massachusetts State Police crime scene services, reported finding the fingerprints of Wallace and Ortiz in a Chrysler 300 that Hernandez rented. Prosecutors call it the ""getaway car,"" which was ultimately found abandoned in Bristol, Connecticut. But no prints were found on the .22-caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near Hernandez's home. Hernandez is charged with illegal possession of that gun. In addition, no prints were found on any of the shell casings, including the casing found stuck to the blue bubblegum in the dumpster outside the Enterprise office. Another key find: tire treads of the rear

"Prison officer Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, was arrested on Thursday. He and fellow Klan members planned to kill a black inmate after his release in retaliation for a fight, officials said . Three Florida prison officers who belong to the Ku Klux Klan have been charged with plotting to kill a black inmate after his release, officials said on Thursday. The KKK men believed the prisoner was infected with HIV and hepatitis and he bit one of them during a fight, officials said. Klans men Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, David Elliot Moran, 47, and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42, each face one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, according to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office. The supposed hit man was an FBI criminal informant who recorded those scenes and others over the past year. Investigators said he faked pictures of the black man's death to help build a case against three Klan members who worked at a Florida prison. The case is the latest black eye for the troubled state prison system. The state said the murder plot started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center in Gainesville, rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmate. Moran is currently a sergeant there. Newcomb was fired in 2013 for failing to meet training requirements, according to the department. Bondi's office said the three were also members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The group has garnered attention in recent months for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. The FBI was alerted to the murder plot by a confidential informant inside the Klan, according to an arrest affidavit. Scroll down for video . David Moran, a prison employee (pictured left), who together with another employee of the Florida Dept. of Corrections and former employee Charles Thomas Newcomb (right) were arrested for plotting to kill a black inmate who had allegedly bitten one guard during a fight . The informant was present when Driver and Moran talked with Newcomb, identified as the KKK chapter's 'Exalted Cyclops' or leader, and recorded many of their conversations. In late 2014, authorities say Driver gave the Klan chapter, called a klavern, a photograph of the inmate, who'd been let out on supervised release. 'Both Driver and Moran ... told the (confidential informant) that they wanted (the inmate) 'six feet under',' the FBI's affidavit said. The informant recorded all three men making plans to murder the inmate, according to the affidavit. In the recordings, the men often refer to the inmate using a racial epithet. Their first attempt to find and kill the inmate failed and the informant recorded a conversation with Driver to confirm he still wanted him dead, the affidavit said. 'Do you want this guy terminated?' the informant asked. 'Yes sir,' Driver replied, according to the affidavit. The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has garnered attention for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists.

Both she and Metcalfe, 36, had been drinking after she received the news that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer. Hugh O'Brien Quinn, prosecuting, said that following an initial post-mortem, it had been concluded that Miss Topliss's death had been accidental. The judge told Metcalfe, pictured, that his behaviour had been 'utterly selfish' and that he showed a 'complete lack of remorse' However, he added: 'That was until Mrs Sharon Wade contacted the police and told them of her concerns. 'She had been a good friend of Tracey Topliss. It was to her that Miss Topliss had complained about domestic violence from her partner.' It was then that a second post-mortem was conducted and the court heard how the pathologist discovered an injury to the victim's cheek, consistent with a heavy punch. Judge Paul Farrer QC said that Miss Topliss was a 'hard-working, successful and well-respected by her professional colleagues.' Addressing Metcalfe, he added: 'There must have been some disagreement between you which caused you to lose your temper. 'You delivered a significant punch to the right side of her face. The blow caused her to fall backwards and strike her head against a table. 'You thought of nobody but yourself. Rather than trying to help her or call the emergency services, you left her lying on the floor of the hallway. 'You waited approximately for two-and-a-half hours before dialling 999. 'Your behaviour was utterly selfish and betrayed a complete lack of remorse. You showed a callous disregard for your victim.' However, David Crigman QC, defending said: 'What he has been found guilty of is one punch with disastrous consequences. 'It must have happened within seconds. There was no evidence of a protracted argument. But for her falling backwards and hitting her head, the deceased would not have suffered a serious injury.' Metcalfe was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter and jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court . Metcalfe was then jailed for five years and after the hearing, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Edward Metcalfe initially deceived the authorities into

Investigators labeled her three children Laci McCarty, aged seven, six-year-old Philip McCarty and Christopher Swist, aged five months, as being in intermediate danger, reports Wesh.com . The children's grandmother told investigators that McCarty, 33, had twice before attempted to kill herself. According to the report, DCF gave the family a brochure, had them sign a safety plan and closed the case. Scroll down for video . Sole survivor: Police said Monday five-month-old Christopher Swist (right), died three days after his mother Jessica McCarty killed his two older siblings in a botched murder-suicide. McCarty (pictured on the left in a suicide-protection vest with bandages on her slashed wrists) survived the attack and was arrested . What happened to the happy family? McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Laci McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself .

"The answer to life’s questions may not lie at the bottom of a bottle of whisky, but a smart label on its side could offer some words of 'wisdom'. Soon smart labels could grace the sides of Johnnie Walker whisky bottles, which would send advertising messages to consumers who scan them with their phones. The labels can also detect when the bottle is sealed and when it is opened. Scroll down for video . Soon smart labels could grace the sides of Johnnie Walker whisky bottles, which would send advertising messages to consumers who scan them with their phones (illustrated). A prototype bottle has gone on show at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona . The prototype ‘smart bottle’ has gone on show at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It is the brainchild of drinks giant Diageo and ThinFilm Electronics, which develops printed electronics. The bottle has sensor tags using ThinFilm's OpenSense technology on its labels that allow the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky, or afterwards. It uses a smartphone’s near field communication (NFC) capabilities so that a handset can be hovered over the label to unlock its digital secrets. The bottle has sensor tags using ThinFilm's OpenSense technology on its label that allows the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky, or afterwards. It also tells a user that the bottle was properly sealed and when it is open (illustrated by the prototype) Scanning the label could, for example, give consumers special offers, cocktail recipes or film content. The technology could also be useful for the London-based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes. The sensor tags will remain readable after the factory seal has been broken so that they provide ‘an additional layer of security in protecting the authenticity of the product,’ Diageo says. This is because unlike static QR codes, which are easy to copy and don’t include sensors, the new labels will be permanently encoded in the factory do they can’t be copied or electronically modified. Scanning the label (pictured) with a phone could, for example, give consumers special offers, cocktail recipes or film content. The technology could also be useful for the London-based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes .

"(CNN)Two years ago, the storied Boston Marathon ended in terror and altered the lives of runners, spectators and those who tried to come to their rescue. Just last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges related to the bombings at the race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. The jury will begin deliberating his punishment next week. The death penalty is on the table. Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police, were intent on terrorizing not just Bostonians, but all Americans, prosecutors said. But the Tsarnaevs were not on the minds of most people in Boston on Wednesday. The injured victims and those who lost their lives were spoken of with reverence in somber ceremonies. Relatives of 8-year-old Martin Richard, the attack's youngest victim, and the family of Krystle Campbell stood with Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin Walsh. Bagpipes played and banners whipped in the wind on Boylston Street, the Boston Globe reported. Boston University graduate student Lingzi Lu also was killed in one of the two horrific blasts that brought chaos to the competitors and spectators near the race's finish line on April 15, 2013. Who were the victims? Many bombing survivors were in the crowd for Wednesday's events, the newspaper said. They wore white, blue and yellow pins celebrating ""One Boston Day,"" which was created to recognize acts of valor and to encourage kindness among Bostonians. Many there and those who couldn't observe the day in person tweeted their respect and memories using #BostonDay. The marathon historically happens on a Monday. This year, runners will take on the 26.2 mile challenge April 20. ""I think today will always be a little emotional for me -- Marathon Monday is my favorite day of the year, and will continue to be, despite these tragedies,"" Boston resident Lindsey Berkowitz told CNN. ""I have so much respect and support for all of the survivors, and hope the city continues to come together on this day to embrace the strength and resilience of Boston, and the love we all have for this great city."" Melanie DiVasta was working just a mile from the finish line in 2013 when one of the bombs set by the Tsarnaevs exploded. Several of her friends were waiting at the finish line. They were unharmed. ""It was just an overwhelming feeling of shock to start hearing about it and seeing images,"" DiVasta said. ""You couldn't help but cry and just ask why."" What's next for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev? CNN's Jareen Imam contributed to this report.

"Corporal Christian Walmsley was found dead in his flat in Bolton after struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder following tours of duty abroad . A soldier who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after a series of tours abroad wrote suicide notes before taking a fatal overdose, an inquest has heard. Corporal Christian Walmsley was found dead in his flat in Bolton, Greater Manchester wearing five war medals after struggling to adapt to civilian life, a coroner was told. The father-of-three had served in the First Gulf War, Bosnia, Angola and Northern Ireland in the Royal Engineers from 1989 until 2000. The 42-year-old had witnessed the 'significant violence only soldiers experience', the hearing at Bolton Coroners Court was told. After retiring from the army, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and Fibromyalgia, a chronic condition causing deep muscle pain. His family members told the court that Cpl Walmsley's two marriages had ended divorce. He had spent some time in Germany over the last decade before returning to the UK to rebuild relationships with his family, relatives said. Stepfather Michael Richards told the hearing: 'He'd always been such a fit lad. But when he came back he had to use a stick because he was so fatigued.' Mr Richards said his stepson had questioned the support given to former servicemen and women. The inquest heard he had previously taken an overdose and told his family he had tried to take his own life. But he discharged himself from the hospital before he had a mental health assessment. In the weeks leading up to his death, his family said Cpl Walmsley had seemed optimistic. Yet on November 4 last year, he had appeared distressed to friends and sent text messages to his mother telling her he was in pain. He was discovered dead on November 6. Police officers found a notebook with several suicide notes inside, the hearing was told. Cpl Walmsley was among British troops in the First Gulf War (pictured in file photo), as well touring Bosnia . The coroner ruled that, without dates on the notes, he could not be certain Cpl Walmsley had attempted suicide. Recording misadventure as a verdict, Coroner Alan Walsh said: 'During his service he would have experienced things only soldiers go through. 'I hope his children are reminded of the bravery he showed in serving his country.' On PTSD among soldiers, the coroner added: 'I do believe it is important that we acknowledge the stress the disorder causes and the total change it causes to someone's life. Those who do serve in the armed forces witness experiences beyond their imagination.'

"QPR director of football Les Ferdinand has called for a Rooney Rule-style law to be introduced in English football to challenge what he believes is a 'lack of diversity' in the game. Football Association chairman Greg Dyke was first to suggest the adoption of the American system - which requires NFL teams to interview at least one minority candidate for each head coaching role - in 2014. And now Ferdinand has reopened the debate by insisting it could be the best way to give prospective black managers the confidence to aspire to positions they currently feel are beyond them. QPR director of football Les Ferdinand would like to see the introduction of a Rooney Rule-style law . The QPR director of football believes there is a lack of diversity in English football . Ferdinand told Sky Sports: 'We're not saying you have to give anybody the job - we're just saying ""give us an interview"" - that's all. 'It's just a case of being able to sit down and put your credentials on the table. At the moment we're not even getting that chance. 'People often talk and say ""I'm not racist"" and don't even realise that they are being racist because they won't give you that opportunity. 'You may have already decided who your next manager is going to be but if I sit down in front of you I might impress you so much that you might recommend me to someone else.' FA chairman Greg Dyke was first to suggest the adoption of the American system in 2014 . Ferdinand wants black managers to be given the opportunity to showcase their credentials at interviews . Dyke's support for the Rooney Rule was not shared by others in the game with Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore rejecting the idea. But Ferdinand's views are shared by anti-racist campaigners Kick It Out, which told Sky Sports News: 'The access to opportunities for employment in football continue to be out of reach for many. The recruitment procedures are flawed, and there is a lack of accountability and transparency in the processes. 'We need to see a level playing field established where individuals possessing the necessary qualifications and experience are able to apply and be taken into proper consideration for positions. 'As it stands, many credible candidates who are suitable for jobs do not feel it is worthwhile applying as they see a closed culture which exists preventing them from having a fair chance.' The League Managers Association supports the implementation of a Rooney Rule-style law, and a spokesman said: 'The LMA is committed to the fundamental principle of equal opportunities for anyone, from any background, who wishes to work and build a career, as a manager or coach, in professional football and we are focussed on the need to increase the number of managers from black and ethnic minorities who have coaching or management qualifications.'

"The wife of a passenger on missing the MH370 flight plane has spoken of her heartache, revealing she is still desperate for answers a year after the airliner vanished. It has been 12 months to the day since Perth father Paul Weeks boarded the Beijing-bound flight in Kuala Lumpur and his wife Danica Weeks is still at a loss about what to tell her young boys - and where their beloved father has gone. Ms Weeks said despite being advised by people that she needs to tell Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2, what happened to him, she refuses to lie to their sons and will wait until the truth is discovered. Scroll down for video . Danica Weeks doesn't know what to say to her sons Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2 about where their daddy has gone . Paul Weeks boarded the MH370 flight a year ago . 'People say you've got to tell them the truth and I say ""do you?"" because I don't and I'm not going to put them through what I think it is then it turns out to be something completely different – and I will choose to tell them,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald. Ms Weeks described the past year as 'surreal' and a 'blur' without being able to see, or even say farewell, to her 'best friend'. 'I'm just this housewife wanting her amazing husband. He did so much for us as a family and he would do exactly the same if he was in my shoes – he would want to bring us home – and I'll do it for him, he deserves it,' she said. Her mining engineer husband, who was on his way to start a new job in Mongolia when the plane inexplicably vanished, gave her his wedding ring when they said their goodbyes at the airport on Marhc 8, 2014. Ms Weeks said she could not have survived the trauma of the past 12 months if it wasn't for the support of the Western Australian community. She added that it has been impossible to begin the mourning process and even think about moving on. 'Even for the children, we haven't even had a memorial or had a chance to say our goodbyes,' she said. '[Since MH370] There have been two plane crashes and they get the bodies home – we don't even get a piece of the plane.' This comes as China's Foreign minister vowed to never give up looking for the plane while Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the search can't go on forever. Other officials said discussions were already under way between countries involved in the search as to whether to call off the hunt in coming weeks.

"(CNN)A court in Turkey this week sentenced two cartoonists to 11 months and 20 days in prison for insulting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Soon after, the court changed the jail sentence to a fine of 7,000 Turkish lira or about $2,700 each. Cartoonists Bahadir Baruter and Ozer Aydogan draw for the weekly satirical magazine Penguen. Founded in 2002 with a weekly average of 65,000 readers, the irreverent comic book -- similar in many ways to the French magazine Charlie Hebdo -- regularly skewers Turkish politicians. A defamation suit was filed against an August cover of Penguen in which a cartoon figure of Erdogan is welcomed to the presidential palace by a public servant. Erdogan tells him, ""But this is so dry. We could have at least slaughtered a journalist."" In a statement to the press, the Penguen team explained that a citizen who described himself as an Erdogan supporter ""sent an email to the Prime Ministry Information Center. ... According to the notice, the employee (in the cartoon) 'made the gay signal with his fingers.' "" Turkey's public prosecutor eventually launched an investigation, claiming that both the speech bubbles and the ""hand drawing"" insulted Erdogan. While the court ruled Wednesday in favor of Erdogan, a full-length explanation of the verdict will be released in a week to 10 days. It is so far unclear whether the judge ruled that the speech bubbles or the ""gay hand gesture"" or both were an insult. The ruling comes amid an increase in criminal cases lodged against journalists, students and public figures for ""defamation against a public officer."" In 2014, Turkey was ranked one of the world's worst jailers of journalists by the media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders and its press status ""not free"" by Freedom House. The Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Nils Muižnieks, expressed his concern about the ruling against Penguen as well as the surge in criminal cases against people accused of insulting Erdogan. ""This sentence is misguided and, along with a pattern of criminal prosecutions, sends a chilling message to media professionals and all those who want to exercise their right to free expression,"" Muižnieks said. Ann Harrison of freedom of press advocacy group PEN International told CNN, ""We have long called for decriminalization of defamation, particularly of state officials, as to criminalize criticism of authorities severely stifles reporting and public debate."" Harrison noted that special mandates from the United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Organization of American States have called for the abolishment of criminal defamation laws. Penguen announced it will appeal the decision. The magazine also defiantly released a new cartoon mocking the case. ""We will continue drawing our cartoons,"" Penguen announced in a statement. ""We hope this case will be the last example of the intimidation effort on free thought.""

"(CNN)When one man sat down next to a second man in a St. Louis light rail car and asked him his opinion on the shooting of Michael Brown, it was not the beginning of a discussion. It was the start of an assault, police said. The second man, who was white, didn't want to answer the question. Then the first man, who was black, boxed him in the face. Two more African-American men joined in the beating, according to a police report about Monday's incident. It was caught on surveillance cameras on the MetroLink train and a passenger recorded it with a cell phone and posted the video online. It has gone viral. Police confirmed to CNN that the online images came from the attack. The victim, 43, was commuting home when a young man in a red T-shirt and cap walked up to him. The victim asked not to be named in media reports. The man asked to use the victim's cell phone. He declined, and the young man sat down beside him. ""Then he asked me my opinion on the Michael Brown thing,"" the victim told KMOV, ""and I responded I was too tired to think about it right now."" The suspect, in his 20s, stood up. ""The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face,"" the victim said. The video showed the suspect unleashing a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who covered himself with his hand and forearms. The two other men, also in their 20s, joined in, police said. As the train pulled into a station, a security guard saw part of the beating and alerted police. The man in the red T-shirt could be seen on video kicking at the victim's face before the train's doors opened and the assailants ran out. The train's surveillance cameras captured clear images of their faces, which MetroLink passed on to journalists. Police are looking for the three men. They face possible charges of third-degree assault, police said. It is a misdemeanor under Missouri law. The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, police said. The first punch dug the frame of his eyeglasses into the skin of his nose, the victim said. He declined to receive medical treatment. But then there was the emotional pain. On the video, people could be heard laughing while the man was beaten. ""I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,"" the victim said. ""And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911."" Condemnation of the beating has spread across social media, including from people who protested the shooting of Brown last year by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The officer was not indicted in Brown's death. St. Louis alderman Antonio French, a vocal community leader in the aftermath of Ferguson, tweeted his disappointment in the beating. ""Mike Brown question sparks MetroLink beating caught on video,"" he wrote. ""This is disgusting. We have a major problem, STL."" CNN's John

"Sacrifice: Jogendra Sen was the only non-white man in his regiment . They were all young, proud, and ready to serve king and country. But among the eager group of young men who had signed up to fight in the First World War together, one face stood out from the rest. Jogendra Sen rushed to join the queue of recruits to the Leeds ‘Pals’ Battalion when it was raised in September 1914 – and became the only non-white member of the 15th West Yorkshire Regiment. Yet were it not for a chance discovery almost a century later, his life – and death – might have been lost to history. A pair of broken and bloodstained spectacles in an Indian museum have shed light on the sacrifice of a volunteer who battled prejudice and racism to serve the country he made his home. They were the same glasses that ‘Jon’, as he was called by his English comrades, had worn in a photograph taken at a training camp in Yorkshire. Cruelly, the Bengal-born student’s race had barred him from fulfilling his dream of being an officer in the British Army, even though he was highly educated and had earned a degree in electrical engineering from Leeds University. But it also won him a place in history. Because less than 20 months after that training camp photograph, Jogendra Sen was killed in action near the Somme on May 22, 1916. Academics believe that the 28-year-old private had become the first Bengali to die fighting for Britain in the war. Although many more would later serve on the Western Front in the Indian Army, at the beginning of the war, most Bengalis were banned from joining up in their own country because of racial prejudice. The catalyst that allowed the tale of Pte Sen’s spectacles to emerge publicly was Dr Santanu Das, a reader in English at King’s College London, who noticed them and some of his other belongings in a museum on a visit to Sen's home town of Chandernagore, some 22 miles north of Kolkata in West Bengal, India. One of the chaps: Private Sen, centre, and his comrades pose for a photograph at a training camp in 1914 . Poignant: Jogendra Sen's glasses and other belongings were discovered in a museum in India . A book of friendship quotes given to Private Jogendra Sen by 'Cis', believed to be Mary Cicely Newton . When the academic mentioned his discovery during a talk at Leeds University, a local researcher recalled seeing Sen’s name on its war memorial. From this, Leeds researchers painstakingly pieced together one man’s war. Sen had worked as an engineer while continuing with his studies. A photograph of a woman found in his personal effects, inscribed ‘Yours with love, Cis’, was found to be of Mary Cicely Newton, who had links with the Mill Hill Chapel in Leeds where, it transpired, Sen sang in the choir. But although Sen was deeply involved in his local community, he faced discrimination even as he offered his life for the war effort. In

Hamilton became a double world champion last season as he drove to victory after an intense season-long battle with team-mate Nico Rosberg, to add to his 2008 success for McLaren.

Hamilton and Mercedes got the new season off to the perfect start after the Briton won the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne last Sunday with Rosberg following him across the finish line in a close second as the team dominated the race weekend. During the interview with Spencer Morgan, Hamilton discussed the pressures that drivers have to contend. 'The thing with Formula One is, people perhaps struggle to understand what's going on inside of the driver. There's the stress of millions of people watching. 'You've got the pressure of the massive corporations sponsoring you. And then, on top of it, you put pressure on yourself, because you really want to succeed.'

'Of course you have to work, but I like to maximize every day, enjoy it, because you never know when it's your last. 'I'm very, very, very conscious of that, so I just like to make sure I enjoy the time I get, and I like to share it with people. That's why we have the Mega Zone. I like to share it with all my friends.'

"By the time she turned five, Amber Rachdi, now 24, from Troutdale in Oregon, weighed 11st - the same as the average adult woman. 19 years later and Ms Rachdi hit rock bottom: virtually housebound and in constant pain, she was ashamed of her enormous 46st (657lb) frame. But after doctors warned that she would be dead by the age of 30, the 24-year-old plucked up the courage to make a change and has since lost 20st in a year. Scroll down for video . Obese: At her heaviest, Amber tipped the scales at an unhealthy 46st (657lbs) 'Sometimes I think to myself I'm never going to change,' she admitted in the run-up to life-saving bariatric surgery. 'Everything hurts. I am so limited in what I can do and where I can go. 'I feel trapped. I'm miserable. I don't like being this person. I don't like being this size. Sometimes I feel so hopeless, I feel that it's not worth it. That maybe it would be better if I'd never been born.' Despite her hefty frame, Ms Rachdi says she has always eaten healthily - and puts the excess pounds to eating more healthy food than she should. She also says she used food to control feelings of anxiety and to deal with her fear of failure but says all the comfort eating just made things worse in the end. 'My relationship with food is unhealthy,' she explains. 'I spend a lot of the day stressing about what I'm going to eat and when I'm going to get it. Comfort eating: Ms Rachdi, pictured with parents Patty and Abe, said she used food to deal with anxiety . Deadly: Ms Rachdi had become so heavy, she was warned that she risked dying by the age of 30 . 'There's anticipation before I eat but it's not enjoyable. It's a feeling of desperation and sadness. Food is a comfort and it's helping me avoid reality. I have a lot of anxiety and I don't like it. 'I'm at peace while I eat. I don't have to think about how I have let everyone around me down. It's a distraction.' As a result of her overeating, her parents were left in a state of panic, with mother Patty admitting that she was sure her daughter would die. 'She always felt she didn't live up to our expectations,' she says. 'She just became a typical underachiever. 'We were told that if she doesn't lose weight, she will die before she's 30.' 'I see a lot of pity in my mum's face when she looks at me and I can't handle that,' said Ms Rachdi, ahead of her surgery. Support: Ms Rachdi has been supported throughout by her boyfriend Rowdy who also moved to Houston . Getting there: Ms Rachdi had to lose 17lb before being allowed to have weight loss surgery .

"Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’

"With 60 years of managerial experience between them, Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger have more big match experience than most coaches still involved in European football. They have, as they saying goes, forgotten more about the game than many people will ever know. Games like this, however, still throw up unique questions and challenges, both before and during play, and on Monday night he two men faced one of their biggest nights of the season in a competition their respective clubs are unusually desperate to win. Here, Ian Ladyman assesses how they shaped up at Old Trafford. TEAM SELECTION . Managers are paid to make the right calls and sometimes that involves an element of risk. Wenger’s decision to include Danny Welbeck ahead of Olivier Giroud seemed baffling. Giroud had scored five goals in his last five games and it was hard to think Welbeck would have anything in his repertoire that his former team-mates in the United ranks didn’t know all about. For an hour here it seemed as though the Arsenal manager had blundered a little. Arsenal were familiarly quick and progressive through midfield but Welbeck seemed unable to hold of possession long enough to bring his supporting players Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade Chamberlain in to play. Arsenal left back Nacho Monreal jumps in the air after putting his side in the lead . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney cancelled out Nacho Monreal's opener . Ultimately, though, Wenger’s decision was vindicated when Welbeck was bright enough to anticipate Antonio Valencia’s back pass and calm enough to win his subsequent challenge with David de Gea and score the winner. For their part, it was surprising to see United without their best passer, Michael Carrick, but they still had a bold look about them at the start and that was indicative of the fact that this was a game Van Gaal wished to win at the first attempt. Daley Blind was selected as United’s only holding player and that, in turn, released Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini to try and hurt Arsenal further up the field. Most interesting, though, was Van Gaal’s decision to select Ashley Young as a traditional winger. Young has looked good going forward from left-back this season and by shunting him further up the field, Van Gaal gave him licence to trouble young Hector Bellerin. It was a plan that worked early on, as Bellerin was booked for a foul, but Young couldn’t maintain the threat and spent too much time in his own half. Ashley Young celebrates with Rooney following the Manchester United and England captain's equaliser . TACTICS AND STYLE . Wenger is nothing if not brave when it comes to these games and that was reflected in his decision to pair Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil as central players. Some Arsenal supporters may have wanted their team to look rather more secure and at times the visiting team did look vulnerable when Fellaini edge forwards to impose his unique brand of physicality on to the Arsenal central defenders. Arsenal’s three-man attacking formation took

The prototype kennel is divided into two areas – one for rest and relaxation and the other for dining. There is also an outside astro-turfed leisure area for some exercise. To work out the most desirable features for the kennel, Samsung surveyed 1,500 people. It found 64 per cent of dog owners think their pets would benefit from more technology and gadgets, with a quarter admitting they would like their dog to have treadmill, and a similar number a TV or tablet.

"Ashley Barnes says that he has laughed off allegations from Jose Mourinho that he was guilty of a 'criminal tackle' on Nemanja Matic when Burnley drew at Chelsea last month. Barnes' challenge was branded 'criminal' by Mourinho and Matic's retaliation saw him receive a red card during last month's 1-1 draw while the Burnley player was unpunished.

There were lots of comments made that it was a 'criminal tackle' and that it was disgusting but you just have to laugh it off really. 'Obviously I've not meant it. I give my all for the team but I'm an honest player. As I've gone to pass the ball he's come to try and screen in front of the strikers. I've took a heavy touch and as I've gone to pass to Jonesy (Dave Jones) I've caught him on the shin with the follow through of the pass. 'It wasn't intentional, of course. I would never go out on a football pitch to try and hurt an opponent. But there were so many different angles and it got picked out and scrutinised to the nth degree but you just have to get on with it. Martins Atkinson shows the red card to Matic after the Serbian pushed Barnes over in retaliation to the tackle . 'I don't really take anything from it. All I can do is apologise that I've caught him in that manner. As you can see nobody in the ground reacted and the next minute he came and pushed me over. Barnes said he was unaware at the time he had hurt the Serbian international: . 'Obviously I wouldn't have been happy if he had caught me there but as I say I've not meant it and I didn't know that I'd hurt him because it was just my momentum that took me that way. 'You're always going to get something like that in your life and I think that's one for me, but I like to think I deal with these things quite well.' Nemanja Matic reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a tough challenge from Ashley Barnes .

"Two of the teenagers who masterminded the Anzac Day terror plot in Melbourne had recently scouted police stations ahead of a possible attack. It comes as a friend of the teenagers who are believed to the planned attack in Melbourne revealed the moment the two young men 'became radicalised'. The man, who has not been identified, claims the death of Numan Haider was the moment 'we all became more radical', according to News Corp Australia. Scroll down for video . Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon . Multiple photos of Mr Besim on his social media pages show him posing with one raised index finger, a symbol that other ISIS supporters have also frequently used . He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) Haider was killed by police last year after he attacked officers with a knife, and is believed to have planned an ISIS-like attack. The two alleged ringleaders of the Anzac Day plot reportedly attended Haider's funeral. The information comes after police held one of the alleged ringleaders in jail under tough new terror laws, despite not being charged. The man, who cannot be identified due to suppression orders, could be held 14 days after police applied for a Preventive Detention Order. Another man, Sevdet Ramadan Besim, 18, was charged with planning to carry out an attack. Both men often visited frequented the controversial Al-Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale. It was also revealed the young men arrested on Saturday had personal links with a senior Australian jihadist and Islamic State recruiter in Syria. Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash, 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS, according to Fairfax Media. Prakash, who is know by the jihadist name Abu Khalid al-Kambodi, may have been in direct communication with the teenagers until recently. Prakash is thought of in the same way as Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer who was believed killed fighting around the Northern Syrian city of Kobane in late 2014. Mr Haider, whose body is pictured (left) being taken to the coroner for examination, died when he was shot by officers after stabbing two policemen outside a Melbourne police station on September 23. It is believed the two men who masterminded the Anzac Day plot attended his funeral (pictured: right) The father of one of the teens arrested in the raids, said his son had benefited from his time at the controversial Al Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale .

"(CNN)Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. ""My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),"" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. ""It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner."" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. ""We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's,"" Mainzer wrote.

"People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13% higher than a colleague . The cost of divorce can wreck retirement many years after the break-up of a marriage, according to research. People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra £2,100 a year – £17,800 rather than £15,700 – to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages £22,100, Prudential’s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that £9,500 – the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday’s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse’s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests . The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce – usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse – does not fade away even as old age approaches. Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through ‘pension-splitting’ arrangements. One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research . Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: ‘Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. ‘A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the

Among them, the family of eight-year-old Martin Richard, the youngest victim to lose his life in the April 15, 2013 attack, headed to Boylston Street to help officials unveil commemorative banners. Four orange signs each bearing a white heart and the word 'Boston' were placed at the site. They were mounted on poles wrapped in blue and yellow flowers, the marathon's colors, to mark the tragedy that took three lives and left more than 260 others injured. Martin's older brother Henry and younger sister Jane, who lost a leg in the explosion, helped unwrap one of the flags on the street as bagpipes played during the low-key ceremony. Scroll down for video . Somber: The Martin family, whose son Richard was killed in the Boston bombings, walk down Boylston Street with Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, left, ahead of a ceremony to mark two years since the tragedy . Emotional: Jane, who lost a leg in the blast, shares a smile with her father while her mother wipes away a tear . Ceremony: Jane and Henry Martin remove a drape covering a memorial banner to honor the victims. In total, four large orange banners were unveiled near the explosion sites on Tuesday morning . Memories: The family takes a moment to reflect at the scene as a ceremony to mark the anniversary begins . The family of Krystle Campbell, who also died in the attacks, helped unwrap another banner with the help of Governor Charlie Baker. Also at the ceremony was Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the bombings. His ashen face was captured in a now-iconic photograph as he was wheeled away by strangers. One of those strangers, Carlos Arredondo, is now a close friend. Arredondo, who became known as 'the man in the cowboy hat' was also at the site on Tuesday morning to greet Bauman as he walked on prosthetic limbs. 'We're here to pay tribute to the people who lost their lives,' Bauman told WFXT-TV. They were joined by city officials including Mayor Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker. At 2.49pm, a moment of silence was held to mark the moment the first of two bombs exploded near the finish line two years ago, while church bells sounded throughout the city. Well-wishers visited the site of the explosions throughout Tuesday to pay tribute to the young people who had lost their lives, and stopped to pay their respects at a memorial bearing their names. Mayor Walsh has declared April 15 'One Boston Day,' on which Bostonians are encouraged to perform random acts of kindness and generosity.

"As a wealth management consultant for a prestigious London firm, Craig Lister is used to keeping his cool. But lately, that's become rather more difficult. Craig, 54, is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer, which starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body - and has the side-effect of hot flushes. 'I have about ten to 12 flushes a day, and six to eight at night,' says Craig, a Yorkshireman who lives in Watford, Hertfordshire, with wife Sue, a teacher, 52, and their three children, George, 22, Evie, 20, and Joseph, 18. Craig, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012. He is now well and his tumours have shrunk . 'I know when one's coming. The feeling suddenly builds up as if you've gone into a sauna. Within minutes I'm in full sweat. Five or ten minutes later, it's gone.' Craig has taken to carrying a spare shirt in his briefcase when he goes to meet clients. 'I'll turn up to a lunch and suddenly have a hot sweat and my shirt will be soaked,' he says. 'I nip off to the loos and have a wash and change.' Hormone therapy, usually given in the form of regular injections or implants, is the first treatment offered to men with advanced prostate cancer - where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. It can't cure the cancer, but can help keep it under control. Hormone therapy is also given alongside radiotherapy to some men with localised prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and make it easier to treat. The jabs typically contain drugs called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) blockers. These act on the pituitary gland in the brain, to stop the production of hormones which are released into the bloodstream and bind with cells in the testicles to make testosterone. Even though the cancer is now microscopic he is still taking hormone treatment . The majority of prostate cancers rely on the hormone to grow. Lowering the amount in the body means it's less able to spread. In England alone, 13,000 men receive the treatment every year - in the form of jabs given monthly or every three months according to the charity Prostate Cancer UK. However, blocking testosterone can cause a variety of side-effects, explains Ali Rooke, a specialist nurse at the charity. 'Testosterone is a man's natural source of energy, so along with hot flushes we often see fatigue. It also has an important role in sexual function, so there can be a loss of libido,' she says. 'There can be mood swings and depression; some men also report breast swelling, nipple tenderness and weight gain around the middle. All of these are similar to what women go through during the menopause, when levels of their equivalent hormone, oestrogen, start to fall.' Hormone therapy also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and can cause bone thinning, because testosterone is important for bone density. Studies by Prostate Cancer UK have found that 80 per cent of men having hormone therapy will suffer hot flushes,

"Aeroplanes are infamous as breeding grounds for bacteria, with tray tables, seats and blankets singled out as the worst offenders on board. But an entrepreneurial team are hoping their new invention will revolutionise the cleaning of aircraft and help airlines win the battle against bacteria . Arthur and Mo Kreitenberg have created a robot, called the Germfalcon, which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin. Scroll down for video . A father and son team have created a robot, called the Germfalcon, which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin . The seats, tray tables and blankets on an aeroplane are breeding ground for bacteria including E.coli . According to the businessmen, germs such as E.coli and MRSA can linger for up to a week on suraces within an aircraft and there are no clear rules on how often aeroplanes should be cleaned. But the family team has developed the unusual new robot as a way to counter issues with cleaning the interior of a plane - which currently only takes place a few times a year. When the plane is parked and empty, the device, which is the size of a drinks cart, patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself. As it does, it spreads its two 'wings' over the seats on either side. Those wings contain UV-C lamps, which are the same type used for disinfection in places like hospitals and water treatment plants. It also has UV-C lamps on its top and sides. Arthur and Mo Kreitenberg, from Los Angeles, said the 3.5billion people expected to fly this year risk falling ill due to poor plane hygiene. Writing on their Kickstarter page to raise money for their project, Mo said: 'Germs will survive on aeroplane surfaces sometimes for as long as seven days. 'There are no regulations or cleanliness standards for the passenger cabins of airplanes. Aeroplane travelers are at heightened risk of catching the common cold, flu, or more serious infections.' They said their device could spare passengers from catching illnesses when flying and give airlines a competitive edge. Last year a study from the Auburn University in Alabama discovered disease-causing bacteria can survive for up to a week inside plane cabins, on surfaces such as seat pockets, tray tables, window shades and armrests. When the plane is parked and empty, the device, which is the size of a drinks cart, patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself. As it does, it spreads its two 'wings' over the seats on either side . Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacteria that could cause infections, skin disease, pneumonia and sepsis, lived the longest (168 hours). Escherichia coli (E. coli), which can cause urinary tract infection, respiratory illness and diarrhoea, was found to survive for 96 hours. Mo added: 'The industry is growing aggressively. Implementing daily, routine airplane sanitization could disrupt or limit the rate bacteria and viruses spread, as the industry grows. 'We have created an efficient and practical way for airlines to sanitize the interiors of commercial planes between passenger

"A 10-year-old Michigan boy ran over his 9-year-old brother with a stolen car in the state's northern Lower Peninsula, authorities said. The younger boy was successfully freed and airlifted to a Flint hospital for treatment. The 9-year-old's ordeal took place after he and his older brother twice stole cars from a Village of Roscommon dealership. Investigation: A 10-year-old Michigan boy seemingly ran over his 9-year-old brother with a stolen car in the state's northern Lower Peninsula, authorities said. The two boys are believed to have used a cooler to break into a used car dealership (pictured) The Roscommon County Sheriff's Department responded at approximately 2:30am Sunday after receiving a call, Detective Sergeant John Wybraniec, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told Daily Mail Online. The boys live with their grandparents across the street from the used car dealership, he said. Wybraniec said deputies responded to the initial break-in and saw the lights were on inside, that a northeast window had been broken, and that there was a cooler underneath it. After securing the business, deputies noticed that vehicles outside were 'askew, not in a neat line that they normally are,' Wybraniec told Daily Mail Online. The sheriff's department said in a news release that thieves swiped car keys and wreaked havoc at the dealership by driving cars and slamming them around. The boys confessed to the joyrides, according to the sheriff's department. Wybraniec told Daily Mail Online said that the boys took out a 2009 Impala and a 2012 Malibu, and that a total of six vehicles were damaged. He said that deputies collected the car keys and the Department of Human Services was contacted. Deputies received a call around 11:30am on Sunday, Wybraniec said. The two boys took the same cars out and drove along Shelley Street. One car, the 2012 Malibu, slammed into a snow bank and got stuck, he said. Wybraniec said that the 10-year-old was behind the wheel of the 2009 Impala that he seemingly drove over his brother. 'We think it's inadvertently,' he told Daily Mail Online. The boy was found underneath the car in a vacant lot next to their house. Wybraniec said that the boys' grandmother discovered the 9-year-old pinned underneath and contacted 911. Wybraniec said it didn't appear his injuries were life-threatening, but that their extent is unknown. He said that deputies do not know the motive for stealing the cars, but that it appears the pair snuck out after their grandparents went to sleep and used the cooler for the break-in. The brothers, who both have learning disabilities, spoke to police and will be interviewed this week by a Children's Assessment Center specialist, Wybraniec said. Charges are possible but unlikely, he said.

I've had a wee chat with him and he's desperate to get involved. 'He's a wee bit away from match fitness and won't be ready to play in the next week or two because he's been out too long. The on-loan Newcastle United wide man has been out injured since he joined the club but is back training . 'But he is mentally in the right place, as in he is here to help, and he could be a welcome addition for the back end of the season.' The deal which saw Ferguson, Haris Vuckic, Gael Bigirimana, Kevin Mbabu and Remie Streete swap St James' Park for Ibrox has proved controversial. So far, only Vuckic has played regularly. Street picked up an injury on his debut against Raith and has not been seen since, while the other three arrived packing injury and fitness issues. But there was another sting in the tail for the frustrated Gers faithful when they learned the deal included a clause which meant their club would have to give Newcastle owner Mike Ashley a £500,000 cheque if they won promotion. McCall, though, joked he would be happy to hand over the cash if it meant he had succeeded in reclaiming Gers' top-flight slot. He said: 'It was a surprise to everyone when the news about that came out, because it's quite a lot of money, especially when only one of them is playing. 'But if it was me - and it's not because it's not my money - I'd love to give Newcastle £500,000 because that means we have got promotion.' Having made 23 appearances for his parent club, Ferguson will be a welcome addition to the squad . Ashley's standing in Govan took another pounding last week too when it emerged the club's iconic trademarks and badges had been registered on a government website in the name of his Sports Direct firm.

"Charges against Andrew Hamblin, 23, stem from a domestic disturbance Sunday at a residence in Campbell County . An East Tennessee pastor who has appeared on a reality television show about handling snakes in church faces charges of assault and reckless endangerment. Charges against Andrew Hamblin, 23, stem from a domestic disturbance Sunday at a residence in Campbell County. No-one was injured. Elizabeth Hamblin told officers that as she was leaving a park with her four children and Jeremy Henegar, Andrew Hamblin got behind them, and pointed a handgun from his vehicle, reports Knox News. The warrant does not specify the relationship between Henegar and Elizabeth Hamblin, but it states the two share the Hickory Hills residence. Elizabeth Hamblin said that when she arrived home Hamblin pulled up in front of their residence and waved a handgun before he fired a shot in the air. She claims he then pointed a gun at Henegar and fired a second time, missing Henegar and striking the residence, before fleeing. Deputies say Elizabeth Hamblin’s infant child was in the home at the time. Investigators recovered a bullet that was fired into the residence. Hamblin is the pastor of the Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, which uses snake handling in services.

In 2013, state wildlife officials seized 53 copper heads and rattlesnakes from Hamblin and cited him for illegally keeping them, but a grand jury declined to indict him. In 2014 Hamblin and his worshipers were evicted from their church because of their fondness for handling venomous snakes while praying and dancing. Clyde Daugherty, who built the LaFollette, Tennessee-based church in 1994, rented the building to Andrew Hamblin for just $267 a month but eventually became fed up with all the serpents slithering about and occasionally injuring or killing congregants. 'Too many people were getting hurt and dying, and that's a proven fact,' Mr Daugherty told . 'He was focused too much on the wrong things, like attention from the media and the TV show, instead of the word of God.'

"The leader of Kazakhstan has apologised after winning the presidential election with 97 per cent of the vote saying it would have been 'undemocratic' for him to make his victory more modest. Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote . But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. Kazakh economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.5 percent this year from a 4.3 percent rise in 2014. Gross domestic product may actually shrink if oil prices drop to below $50 per barrel, Kazakh officials have said.

"It really is tough to think of a previous Premier League game of such importance being undercut by this depth of friendship between dugouts. Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey know each other inside out. They also know how their careers could be shaped by 90 minutes of football at Villa Park. From living 10 minutes apart in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, the pair will be 10 metres away from each other on a touchline in Birmingham, relishing the pressure. The careers of Tim Sherwood (above) and Chris Ramsey (below) could be shaped by 90 minutes on Tuesday . Ramsey's QPR go to the home of Sherwood's Villa for a match that could see them out of the bottom three . A match of this magnitude is what these two English coaches craved during years working together at Tottenham Hotspur, probably believing they would be united in battle. A quirky sequence of events has pitted them on opposite sides instead. Sherwood came close to the QPR job when Harry Redknapp resigned, but Paul Lambert was sacked in the same period and Aston Villa placed the call. Ramsey looked the unlikely choice at Loftus Road but guided QPR to their first away Premier League victory this season at Sunderland, earning the reins until the summer. A second win on the road at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday means QPR can go above Villa with three points on Tuesday night, plunging Sherwood’s team into the relegation zone. The reverse result would take Villa to the precipice of safety, leaving QPR with a fainter glimmer of hope. QPR come into the match with confidence after a convincing 4-1 victory over Villa's neighbours West Brom . Christian Benteke celebrates his goal in Villa's 3-1 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday . It is a sliding doors match, the kind to be looked back upon in months to come as the moment futures were directed, both for clubs and managers. Lose and suffer relegation? Sherwood’s position would come under considerable question, his trajectory as the bright thing of English coaching skewered. Ramsey would likely be shuffled back to a role behind the curtain. Win and survive? Reputation enhanced, the opportunity to lay foundations would be presented. Either way, this pair will share pints again, unpicking the evening when their top-flight statuses came under enormous scrutiny. Neither Sherwood nor Ramsey has been trying to underplay this match, even if one offered a little more bombast than the other. ‘I think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club,’ said Sherwood. ‘If I could hype up the pressure even more I would.’ ‘A win would be a fantastic boost for us because it would see us above the line,’ said Ramsey. ‘It would give the fans a lot of hope that we have a chance of staying up.’ Neighbours within 10 minutes and friends, Ramsey (centre) and Sherwood (right) know each other inside out . The pair worked together at Spurs with Les Ferdinand (second right), now QPR's director of football

"This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath. She had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life. Rules: Ms Fritz explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal, but that regulations on the Antarctic expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup .

Two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of Snow Hill Island, Antarctic Peninsula . Charlene, whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend, had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process. She said: 'Basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so, then abandons them on the beach. 'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea.

"(CNN)It's a golfing paradise forged from the ashes of the space race. And, according to owner Dave Pelz, it might just be the best back garden on the planet. One thing is certain, no self-respecting golfer would emerge from a stint patrolling the perfectly coiffured turf at Chez Pelz in Austin, Texas any worse around the greens. ""They say it's the world's best backyard,"" one of golf's most renowned short game coaches, and former NASA employee, told CNN's Living Golf show. ""It's my dream. I have a dream job and I live in my dream house. I live with my dream girl. I'm a happy guy."" It's no wonder Pelz is content. His named is etched in the evolution of golf. His students, including five-time major champion Phil Mickelson, have amassed a combined 20 majors between them and as one of golf's most fertile brains, Pelz has 26 golf patents to his name. The 70-year-old still works with Mickelson prior to major tournaments and the player known as ""Lefty""credits Pelz with helping to elevate his game to the elite level. ""I was 0-for-43 in majors before I met him, and I've won four, plus a Players Championship since,"" Mickelson was quoted as saying prior to capturing his fifth major -- the British Open -- in 2013. ""That says it all about him, in my book."" The septuagenarian pioneered the use of statistics back in the 1970s and 80s, his analysis of the game sculpted by a 15-year stint working for space agency NASA. His insistence on short game practice, and invention of clubs to help players hone their skills in that department, have informed the modern professional's approach. ""I did space research and golf research on my own time,"" explained the brains behind the two-ball putter, one of the best-selling clubs of all time that helped golfers line up their putts more accurately. ""NASA has the most unbelievable equipment in the world and that was the dawn of the space race. Sputnik had just gone up. ""We were trying to catch the Russians in terms of space exploration. And I got in a wonderful group of scientists and learned to do honest to God research."" Pelz banked a place at Indiana University thanks to a golf scholarship and chose to study physics. He famously played the legendary Jack Nicklaus 22 times and lost to the 18-time major champion on every occasion, but made significant improvements to his game once he began working for NASA. Using the one variable at a time method favored by scientists, Pelz began grading his own performance using the methods he'd picked up at the Goddard Space Flight Center. And gradually, piece by piece, he began to deconstruct each facet of his game and isolate the improvements he needed to make. ""I started measuring my own putting,"" he said. ""I started measuring my short game. I started measuring my driving. ""I learned how to measure things at Goddard Space Flight Center because they had the best instruments in the world and I learned the practical application of the

"MI5 covered up the sexual abuse of boys in the notorious Kincora home, a former Army Intelligence officer claimed last night. Brian Gemmell, a former captain in the Intelligence Corps, said spy chiefs ordered him to ‘stop digging’ when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the Northern Ireland children’s’ home. He spoke out during a meeting with victim Richard Kerr, who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from the home before being molested by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile gang. Scroll down for video . Brian Gemmell, a former captain in the Army Intelligence Corps (pictured), said MI5 spy chiefs ordered him to ‘stop digging’ when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the Northern Ireland children’s’ home, Kincora . He claimed he was sexually abused by politicians and other senior men at Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico and Elm Guest House, in Barnes, west London, which are being investigated by Scotland Yard amid ‘credible’ claims a Tory MP murdered a young boy. Campaigners claim Mr Kerr’s account provides a clear link between VIP paedophile rings in London and Belfast. MI5 has faced long-standing allegations of covering up child abuse to enable it to gather intelligence on Loyalist politicians during the Troubles. But it has also been accused of not acting to protect leading Establishment figures involved in the crimes. Mr Gemmell, who served in military intelligence in Belfast, presented a report on allegations of abuse at Kincora to a senior MI5 officer in 1975 but to his astonishment was told to quit his probe. Speaking to Mr Kerr on Channel 4 News, he said: ‘That’s the thing that hits me - that if I really pushed the thing through, you could have been rescued. I’m sorry.’ His revelations will strengthen calls for the allegations about the Irish children’s home to be covered by the judge-led abuse inquiry announced by Home Secretary Theresa May. The inquiry will investigate whether public bodies, including governments, charities, the Church and BBC, failed to protect children. It was set up amid claims a child sex gang operated in Westminster in the 1980s. The investigation into historical abuse, which will be led by New Zealand High Court judge, Justice Lowell Goddard, is likely to be able to study files held by MI5. Mr Gemmell said: ‘I think Richard’s transporting over to the United Kingdom mainland to be abused, rather than just being abused in Northern Ireland, speaks volumes. It ties the two together.’ Mr Gemmell met with victim Richard Kerr, who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from Kincora (pictured) before being molested by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile gang . Speaking to Channel 4 News, Mr Kerr, who now lives in Dallas, Texas, said he and two other boys suffered abuse at Kincora in the mid-1970s before being trafficked to London in 1977, where they suffered further abuse. Boys - many in local authority care - are alleged to have been abused by figures including the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, Cabinet ministers, clergymen, pop stars,

"President Barack Obama threw off the gloves and took a direct punch at one of his possible successors, likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker, in an interview airing this morning. Responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office, Obama told NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep that such an approach 'would be foolish.' 'And, you know, perhaps Mr. Walker, after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy, will feel the same way,' the president added. Walker fired back at Obama on Twitter, saying, 'Americans would be better served by a President who spent more time working with governors & Congress rather than attacking them.' Scroll down for video . Foolish: In an interview with NPR, Obama said likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker may change his 'foolish' position on a deal with Iran 'after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy' Obama's jab at Walker departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term . Obama's jab at Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term. The current administration has been more willing to weigh in, however, when a presumed Republican candidate threatens to dismantle one of the president's prized domestic or foreign policies, which, in the case of Walker, was the nuclear arrangement with Iran. 'I am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedents of presidential power that they won't start calling to question the capacity of the executive branch of the United States to enter into agreements with other countries,' Obama told Inskeep during their Monday afternoon chat following the NPR host's invocation of Walker's past comments. 'If that starts being questioned, that's going to be a problem for our friends and that's going to embolden our enemies.' Continuing, Obama said, that 'would be a foolish approach to take' and slammed Walker. A cadre of probable Republican presidential contenders have spoken out against the Obama administration's laboriously negotiated pact with Iran to stunt the growth of the country's program. Walker is the only one to say he would not honor his predecessor's deal with Iran and the international community if elevated to presidency, however. 'If I ultimately choose to run, and if I’m honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing — not just for the region but for this world — we need is a nuclear-armed Iran,' he told radio host Charlie Sykes last week.

"It is little over a year since Alan Pardew became involved in a rather ugly touchline confrontation with Manuel Pellegrini while managing Newcastle. Pardew was warned about his behaviour by the FA and wrote to Pellegrini to apologise for the offensive name he called him. On Monday at Selhurst Park, Pardew, now manager of Crystal Palace, meets Pellegrini and Manchester City again having taken steps to change a pattern of behaviour he feared was becoming destructive. After taking advice from the League Managers’ Association, the 53-year-old has benefited from sessions with former international cricketer Jeremy Snape, now a sports psychologist. Alan Pardew called Manuel Pellegrini a 'f***ing old c**t' during Premier League encounter back in . The touchline spat occurred during a Premier League match between Newcastle and Man City in January 2014 . ‘My natural instinct is to be aggressive in the way my teams play,’ Pardew told the BBC. ‘But I have had to learn from my own experiences and not get too involved in that myself. Jeremy has helped me on the sidelines in terms of focusing on what I can control. ‘All the times I have been in trouble (I have reacted) when I felt an injustice so when those issues arise now, I know not to react and that is when I switch the off button.’ Pellegrini’s team are under a little pressure. Now trailing neighbours Manchester United ahead of Sunday’s derby at Old Trafford, Pellegrini knows he must lift his side from a run of results that has seen them lose touch with leaders Chelsea. Crystal Palace boss Pardew believes he has the ability to manage one of England's top sides . Pardew feels he would make a decent job of managing a top-four team if given the chance. ‘I look at the top teams and feel I could do that job better than I’m seeing it being done. But if I work in this part of the league for the rest of my career I will be extremely happy,’ he said. Pellegrini said recently he felt his City squad lacked one really big player. This week, he explained: ‘Well, it is just the way of thinking, that big teams need to sign a big player. It is very difficult to do it every year — but every two years you must do it.’

'I will say that they are known to police,' he said. 'At this point in time there's nothing to suggest there was any incident that occurred in terms of a disturbance.' The man's other daughter reportedly discovered all three bodies when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs. DI Isherwood earlier said that investigations indicate that there is no further threat to public safety. 'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' he said.

"When Jack Wilshere was first showing signs of his enormous potential at Luton Town’s academy, the big boys down the road soon came calling. Everyone was into little Wilshere, with West Ham (the team his dad Andy supports), Tottenham and Arsenal all offering to give Luton’s academy kid a shot at the highest level. Wilshere was a Hitchin boy, spotted early by Luton’s scouts before Arsenal took him to their Hale End academy at nine. At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger’s side. Charlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham . Like Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town . Soon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder. The Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season. ‘We just want what’s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,’ said dad Julio on Wednesday. ‘He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.’ Charlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. ‘Other parents have commented on it in the past,’ admitted Julio. The big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA’s compensation guidelines. The transfer fee involved is £10,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton. There are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision. Charlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost £10,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton . 11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona . Julio’s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports. Julio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: ‘Charlie doesn’t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.’ Charlie’s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents’ home in

"Founder: The charity was set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996 . A leading children’s charity is facing a crisis after three of its directors resigned amid an apparent row over funding, it was revealed yesterday. Kids Company has received around £30 million of public money since 2008 and has celebrity backers including rock group Coldplay, businessman Sir Richard Branson and Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996, it supports 36,000 vulnerable children in London, Bristol and Liverpool and has been championed by Prince Charles and David Cameron. But concerns about the way the charity is run are understood to have led some senior managers to raise issues with its board of trustees. The resignations of interim finance director Diane Hamilton, human resources chief Adrian Stones and director of development Mandy Lloyd then followed. A statement from Kids Company said: ‘It was with great regret that they felt unable to continue working within the organisation because of the uncertainty of funding, which led to high levels of stress in the workplace which was unsustainable.’ But a source close to the directors reportedly said: ‘These departures are a direct result of these employees’ doubts about the future of Kids Company ... The trustees were told of their doubts but they don’t seem to have reacted at all.’ Miss Batmanghelidjh, a trained psychotherapist, became known as ‘Mother Camila of Camberwell’ for her work with some of South London’s most disadvantaged children. Michael Gove is said to have tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012 . Born in Iran, she is known for her colourful style. In 2013 she was named one of Britain’s 100 most powerful women by Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour and appointed a CBE. The Sunday Times reported that the resignations were revealed as she denied persuading Mr Cameron to intervene after then education secretary Michael Gove tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012. Miss Batmanghelidjh said that an independent audit in 2014 showed ‘the charity was well run but lacked funding’. But critics have questioned whether it is over-staffed – it employs around 600 people.

"A 19-year-old man has been indicted on murder and other charges in the shooting death of a Las Vegas mother of four in a neighborhood gunbattle. The indictment filed Friday accuses defendant Erich Milton Nowsch Jr. of murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle. The shooting was initially characterized as road rage but was later found to involve more complex relationships. Scroll down for video . Erich Nowsch Jr. (pictured in a Las Vegas courtroom February 23) was indicted Friday on charges of murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle in the killing of Tammy Meyers . The indictment doesn't name a getaway driver in the February 12 killing of 44-year-old Tammy Meyers. Her husband, Robert Meyers, says she took their daughter home after a late-night driving lesson and fetched her 22-year-old son with his gun to find a driver who frightened her earlier. The 19-year-old's defense team hope the request to the coroner's office will be able to determine whether Meyers, 44, or somebody next to her fired a gun before she died . Police say the son fired several shots at Nowsch during the fatal shootout in a cul-de-sac outside the Meyers home. The 44-year-old Meyers was wounded in the head February 12 and died two days later. Nowsch was arrested on February 19. Nowsch's defense team said in court today they are trying to obtain surveillance video from Johnson Junior High School, where Meyers was allegedly teaching her daughter to parallel park the night before the shooting. They also want police to turn over radio recordings from the night of the shooting and the day of Nowach's arrest, reported Las Vegas Review Journal. The 19-year-old is being held without bail. He is due back in court March 12. Many questions remain after conflicting accounts from authorities and Meyers' family about what initially was characterized as a road rage attack. Following Nowsch's arrest late last month, his lawyers said he was high on marijuana while he was being questioned, and police knew it. He surrendered to the authorities after a stand-off in suburban Las Vegas. Claus said he plans to argue in court that anything Nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial. It's not clear what Nowsch told detectives after his arrest. 'People tend to say things that aren't entirely credible when they're under the influence,' he told the Associated Press. Attorney Augustus Claus said 'not only' did the police let Nowsch smoke, they 'watched him do it' as they tried 'to talk him down' during a standoff that involved a helicopter and a SWAT team. Last week, Claus said he may consider using a fractured skull Nowsch suffered as an infant at the hands of his abuse father in his defense. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson will consider Nowsch's childhood injury while deciding whether to seek the death penalty against him. Nowsch has been accused of shooting 44-year-old Tammy Meyers dead during an act of road rage. It has since

"Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' by the sexual assault but freed Josh Sweet after serving just two months on remand . A burglar who broke into a young teacher's home and sexually assaulted her as she lay in bed has been freed by a judge who handed him a community sentence. The decision's been slammed by a Victim Support charity worker, who said that 'victims deserve justice', after the 24-year-old teacher was left traumatised by the ordeal. Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' during the case at Birmingham Crown Court, which has left her 'petrified' and afraid to go out. But Joshua Sweet, 20, from Birmingham, was freed and given a three-year community order on account of an early plea and having spent just two months in jail awaiting his court appearance. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said Sweet broke into the victim's home and took items including car keys and a mobile phone before making his way upstairs, where the victim was asleep. In the dead of night, she awoke to find the intruder 'standing beside her bed' and screamed, which is when the terrifying assault began. Sweet then rolled down her duvet and touched the defendant sexually, saying 'you're not going to make any noise are you?' Miss Rai said the woman was extremely frightened and tried to divert the defendant. Sweet touched the woman’s bottom and upper thigh but as he took hold of the waistband of her pyjama bottoms, her house-mate, the owner of the property, came into the room and he fled. The police were called and Sweet was arrested nearby, but the victim's ordeal continued. In a statement she said she had been 'petrified' at finding a stranger in her bedroom and that the incident, which had caused her to take time off work, had left her feeling vulnerable and unsafe. She said she had put a bolt on her bedroom door and had been reluctant to come out. Sentencing guidelines for sexual assaults range up to eight years for the most serious cases. And although the nature of this case falls in the lower end of the scale, the sentence angered a victim support charity that said offenders 'must be given a punishment that fits their crime'. Joshua Sweet, 20, admitted burglary and sexual assault and was given a three-year community order, ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work and must register as a sex offender for five years . Carolyn Hodrien, victim services director for Victim Support, said: 'From supporting thousands of victims of sexual assault, we know what a devastating impact it can have on people's lives. 'Victims deserve justice and for this to happen offenders must be given a punishment that fits their crime. Community orders can be a really effective way to manage some offenders, but should never be issued for a serious offence or as a quick-fix.' Sweet, 20, of Alwold Road, Weoley Castle, Birmingham, who admitted burglary and sexual assault, was also ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work and register as

"James Bond may like his Martini shaken, not stirred, but the fictional spy hasn't had to contend with zero gravity when sipping his favourite tipple. Making cocktails in space is a difficult business, but now there’s a specially designed ‘glass’ in the pipeline that promises to force liquid to stay put. Grooves in the 3D printed vessel will let astronauts enjoy the aroma of a beverage and keep the fluid in place so they can drink in a way they are used to on Earth. Scroll down for videos . A Californian company has designed a martini glass (pictured alongside a cup) intended for zero gravity that has ridges to ensure liquid stays inside it and can be sipped by an astronaut . A company called Cosmic Lifestyle Corp (CLC) in Oakland, California came up with the design - which is a work in progress - to solve the problem of drinking in space. Nasa once developed ‘parabolic sherry’ and astronauts have been known to have a swig of vodka, but drinking from a conventional glass is difficult. This is because liquid becomes sticky and clumps together in blobs in zero gravity. If a glob of water is broken, for example, it splits into many smaller blobs that scatter everywhere and are hard to clean up. To solve this problem, liquid is typically kept in bags with attachment for straws, but while this is practical, it’s not an elegant solution and means astronauts can’t smell the liquid, which is naturally less pungent and tasteless in zero gravity. The start-up chose to 3D print the cup so the complicated design can be refined quickly – with each design taking around 15 hours to print. Because there is already a printer on the ISS, the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away, without the need to transport the delicate vessels. Image shows early versions . In the 1979 film, Moonraker, James Bond, played by Roger Moore (a poster is shown), has a space adventure but doesn't attempt to drink his signature martini in space . The first step is drop the glass inside a 102ft-tall lift at Portland State University, to produce two seconds of weightlessness, so that the durability of the glass and how different fluids react, can be tested. Experts will use a high speed camera to look at what is happening and refine the design. Researchers will then conduct live tests with humans on a parabolic aircraft or ‘vomit comet’. One unofficial test has already taken place. The ultimate goal is to 3D print a ‘glass’ on the ISS. ‘The Zero Gravity Cocktail Project is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment,’ the company said. ‘We are creating an open air drinking container that allows you to enjoy the aroma of the drink, yet keep the fluids under control. ‘Your mouth completes the connection like a straw and you can suck the drink into your mouth.’ The ‘glass,’ which is said to ‘combine the beauty of a classic martini glass with the physics of space science’ has

"Footage has emerged of doomed Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan speaking about second chances just hours after the first round of executions on January 18. The heartbreaking video shows Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail. Behind him prison bars are visible as he looks tearily into the camera and talks in soft spoken tones. Scroll down for video . The heartbreaking video shows Andrew Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail . The 30-second video was aired on Channel Seven's Sunday Night. 'My name's Andrew Chan,' the convicted drug smuggler said. 'It's a day - pretty much a few hours - after the execution of six innocent lives. 'Guess what runs through my head is about how precious life really is.' On January 18, five people were executed by firing squad on Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island - in Central Java. Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, Malawi's Namaona Denis and Indonesia's Rani Adriani were killed that day. Another woman Tran Bich Hanh, from Vietnam, was also put to death nearby. Myuran Sukuraman (right) revealed he knew the identity of ringleader Mr Big and tried to strike a deal with Indonesian police to spare his life, while Chan (left) denied he knew anything about him . Kerobokan prison had been the Bali Nine duo's home for 10 years after they were found guilty of drug smuggling . Their deaths triggered Chan to ask: 'I guess sometimes you kinda got to think, what does it take to get a second chance? 'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you’re a convicted criminal.' Since they were sentenced to death, Chan converted to Christianity and studied to become a pastor while behind bars. At the same time, Sukuraman - under the tutelage of Ben Quilty - has become an artist, even teaching inmates how to paint. This turnaround in the pair has led many to believe they have been rehabilitated. Sunday Night also revealed fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukuraman knew the identity of 'Mr Big' - the ringleader of the group - but did not want to name him publicly as he feared for the safety his family. Sukuraman told the news program he had tried to trade this information to avoid the death penalty, but Indonesian police refused the offer. Myuran Sukuraman (left) and Andrew Chan (right) are being led to an armoured vehicle at Cilacap airport in Central Java on Wednesday . 'We tried with the police to get some sort of co-operation thing but there weren't really like that was our only card that we had to play,' he said.

"Keith Thurman and Robert Guerrero gave a prime-time television audience something to watch Saturday night. Thurman won a piece of the welterweight title with a bruising decision win over Guerrero in the debut of a new boxing series on network television. And he did it with the kind of fight that had the crowd on its feet and gave a much needed boost to boxing in the first prime-time fights on NBC in 30 years. 'That's kind of performance that wins the hearts of fans even when you don't win the fight,' Guerrero said. 'The fans love that and that's what boxing is all about.' Keith Thurman (left) lands a left jab on Robert Guerrero during their WBA welterweight title bout . The fight was the highlight of a card that also included a win by Adrien Broner over John Molina in a super lightweight bout. But while fans booed that fight for lack of action, they cheered from the opening bell as Thurman took apart Guerrero in a fight that had a little bit of something for every fan - except a knockout. 'I know I was hurting him each and every round,' Thurman said. 'But he's a veteran and knew how to pace himself and stay a little out of my range.' Thurman knocked Guerrero down in the ninth round and won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown. But Guerrero fought hard and wasn't afraid to trade punches even while bleeding from a cut over his left eye late in the bout. A bloodied Guerrero rises to his feet after he was knocked down by Thurman in the ninth round . Thurman is sent to the neutral corner by referee Kenny Bayless as Guerrero recovers on the canvas . Thurman landed 211 of 598 punches to 104 of 497 for Guerrero, but that didn't tell the whole story. Thurman's punches were much harder and seemed to shake Guerrero on several occasions, though they didn't deter him from pressing the fight even after being knocked down and nearly knocked out in the ninth round. 'I keep fighting my heart out and that's what the fans like about me,' Guerrero said . Thurman won every round on one ringside scorecard and 10 rounds on the other two, using thudding punches to keep Guerrero away. Still, he was never able to put him away and Guerrero came back in the 10th round to land some big punches of his own while Thurman was on the ropes. 'Robert Guerrero was a tremendous warrior,' Thurman said. 'He was there the whole way.' Thurman won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown . It was a signature win for Thurman, and not only because he was showcased on the top of the television card. He beat a fighter who fought Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2012, lasting all 12 rounds though dropping a lopsided decision. And he remained unbeaten in 25 fights with a performance that could put him in

"The good news for all concerned in Monaco was that it had stopped raining. Arsene Wenger had raised fears on the eve of the game and as the downpour continued into the night the Arsenal manager wasn't the only one casting anxious glances skywards.

Much has happened to Monaco since then. They almost dropped into the third tier of French football and faced extinction before Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev came to the rescue and got them moving in the right direction once again. The first leg result against Arsenal was confirmation that the Rybolovlev project is still on track, having survived a change of direction and an exodus of top players like James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao last summer.

"Nigel Farage has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten, it can be revealed. Ukip, which will today unveil its manifesto, has reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls. A party strategist said 'something extraordinary' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list. Nigel Farage has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten . South Thanet, Kent (Majority: Con 7,617) Clacton, Essex (Ukip 12,404) Rochester & Strood, Kent (Ukip 2,920) Thurrock, Essex (Con 92) Great Grimsby, Lincs (Labour 714) Boston & Skegness, Lincs (Con 12,426) Camborne & Redruth, Cornwall (Con 66) Dudley North, West Midlands (Lab 649) Castle Point, Essex (Cons 7,632) Heywood & Middleton, Greater Manchester (Lab 617) After Ukip won the Rochester and Strood by-election last November and gained its second MP, Mr Farage said the party could go on to win 'dozens of seats' in the election. But Ukip campaign chiefs have now adopted a 'shotgun' approach with a far fewer targets. Mr Farage will this morning launch the party's manifesto in Thurrock, Essex. A Ukip source said: 'It will be a broad and open offer to those on low and middle incomes. That's something which no other party is doing.' Among the seats dropped from the list of hopefuls is Folkestone and Hythe, where candidate Janice Atkinson was replaced after allegations of fraudulent expenses claims. The target list includes South Thanet, where Mr Farage is standing, along with Clacton and Rochester and Strood, where Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless won by-elections after defecting from the Tories. The party also hopes to win in Thurrock, a tight three-way marginal where the Tories are defending a majority of just 92. Another focus is Heywood and Middleton, in Greater Manchester, where it narrowly lost a by-election to Labour last October. Ukip's election co-ordinator Chris Bruni-Lowe, who masterminded last year's by-election wins, is organising campaigns in the ten targets. The party is helping write campaign literature, organising mailshots to voters and putting up billboards, while other candidates are mostly being left to their own devices. Clacton, where Tory defector Douglas Carswell (left) is standing for Ukip, is one of the few seats the party still thinks he can win . Ukip's immigration spokesman has admitted that even the leadership of the party has been left confused by its policy on foreigners moving to Britain. At an event last month Steven Woolfe said the deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, who has written Ukip's manifesto, did not understand the immigration policy even when he showed her diagrams to explain it. It is claimed that Mr Woolfe, who was speaking after a meeting in Dudley, said: 'The problem is, even within my own party, my own deputy chairman, didn't seem to understand it herself despite the fact I actually put picture graphs. 'I put the numbers on and the point is people confuse immigration. Immigration consists of loads of

"Caller ID as we know it could be getting a revamp. Facebook has launched a new app called Hello designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers. Scroll down for video . Facebook has launched a new app called Hello (pictured) designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers . The free app is currently in testing and is only available on Android devices in the US. It is expected to roll out to other regions and devices if testing is successful. 'Billions of calls are made everyday on mobile phones and people often have very little information about who’s calling them,' explained Facebook's product manager Andrea Vaccari in a blog post. Facebook has tweaked its News Feed setting to make posts from friends more prominent. The rules about seeing multiple posts from the same person in a row have been relaxed to show more from friends. Content posted directly by friends who people interact with more or have a direct relationship with will now appear higher up in News Feed so they are less likely to miss it. The latest update will also make posts and Pages that friends have liked and commented on appear lower down. Facebook said: 'The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you. 'This means we need to give you the right mix of updates from friends and businesses. 'This balance is different for everyone [and] as more people and pages are sharing more content, we need to keep improving News Feed to get this balance right.' 'Today we are starting to test Hello, a new app built by the Messenger team. 'Hello connects with Facebook so you can see who’s calling, block unwanted calls and search for people and places.' When a user receives a call, Hello shows them info about who’s calling, even if they don’t have that number saved. Users will only see information that people have already shared on Facebook, and not everyone links their mobile number to their account so this could be the app's downfall. Callers must also have a Facebook account in order for the data to be shared but they don't necessarily have to be logged in at the time of the call. They also don't need to have Hello installed, either. Another feature of Hello includes making it easier to block unwanted calls. From the settings menu in Hello people can block specific numbers and adjust whether they want to automatically block calls from commonly blocked numbers. This is useful for blocking company phone numbers or spam callers, for example, and blocked calls go straight to voicemail.

"A New Zealand couple needed a home upon returning home after living in the UK, so they built one on the back of an old flatbed truck. Hannah and Alex purchased a 1986 Hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love. The result was a solar-powered two-bedroom, wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in Nelson, New Zealand. How a truck becomes a home: A New Zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck . Making do: Alex (left) and Hannah (right) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own, but couldn't afford to buy a full-sized lot . 'We came back to New Zealand from the UK in 2009,' Alex told Smoking Tire. 'We knew we couldn't afford to buy property at that point. We didn't have money.' So, the couple started building. After a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time, the project took shape. Though, to hear Hannah tell it, they just slapped up the place in a weekend. '[We] welded a frame, put the wood on and built this house,' the modest Kiwi told Smoking Tire's Matt Farah. Once they finished, the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they'd purchased in Nelson, New Zealand. Now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature: aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees and a babbling brook outside their door. Ingenuity: The couple started with a steel frame and slowly, project by project, built a home in about a year and a half . Gorgeous: Hannah and Alex now have a gorgeous, wood-lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook . Details: The couple has a wood-fired stove to keep out the cold, stained glass windows and other creature comforts . They're nearly self-sufficient, too. The home is powered mostly by solar panels. Alex said their first power bill was just $25. The stove and hot water are gas-powered and water comes from a nearby spring. 'I didn't want to live inside a plastic box,' Alex said. 'Not because I'm a hippie but because it feels nicer and is just a nicer place to be.' All told, the project cost Hannah and Alex about $25,000. And the couple even plans to build another one like one day. 'It's really, really nice,' Hannah said. 'We love it.' Two bedrooms: The home has a bedroom for the couple as well as a loft that doubles as a spare room where the cat sleeps . Green: Water comes from a nearby spring and most of the electricity comes from solar panels .

"(CNN)Is America a nation divided? And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s. Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared

"A mother-of-two who was abused by her own father throughout her childhood has spoken out after he was jailed for 22 years. Mandy Greenwood, 39, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, said: 'My dad used to tell me he only did it because he loved me. I was more like his wife than his daughter. 'Now he's in jail the sense of freedom and relief is incredible. He can never hurt another child again.' Brave: Mandy Greenwood has spoken out about the father who abused her as a child . Mandy carried the terrible secret around with her for more than 20 years – and it was only after she confided in her husband, Dave, that she felt strong enough to seek help. She has waived her right to anonymity in the hope that other victims of abuse will come forward too. Mandy's abuse began at the age of seven, when her father, Keith Whitworth, now 61, came into her bedroom and woke her up during the night. What began as touching became rape on an almost daily basis. Mandy said: 'I would cry myself to sleep each night. There was nobody for me to confide in. I felt so alone and so sad. I wasn't close to my mum at all. 'Sometimes he would take me to the park – what seemed like a nice trip out – but he would abuse me then too. Guilty: Keith Whitworth has been jailed for 22 years for a catalogue of abuse against three children . 'He would tell me: 'I'm only doing this because I love you.' 'In my child's mind, I thought of myself as his wife rather than his daughter.' As a child, Mandy was given a choice at bedtime; she could either go to bed early or take a beating with her father's belt. She said: 'My siblings would go to bed but I would take the belt because I didn't want to go to bed. I was scared of going to bed. 'It was a no-win situation and it was only as an adult that I realised how twisted and cruel he was.' New family: Mandy escaped home life by getting pregnant with her daughter at 15, and son four years later . In a desperate effort to escape her home life, Mandy became pregnant. At 15, she had a daughter, and four years later she had a son. She said: 'To me, sex was nothing special. It was a dirty, unpleasant thing. I wanted a baby because I needed my own family. 'When my daughter was born, I felt a surge of love and happiness that I had never experienced before. I left home and I was determined to be a good mum. It was my focus in life.' Mandy did not return home and the abuse stopped. But her father lived nearby and she saw him on a regular basis. She said: 'At first, I tried to keep a friendly relationship, for the sake of appearances. But he was very touchy-feely – always pushing the boundaries. 'The abuse was

"Lee Dyer, 40, (pictured), has been sentenced to five years in prison after trying to smuggle £8million worth of liquid amphetamine across the border . A van driver who tried to smuggle £8million worth of liquid amphetamine in wine bottles has been jailed for five years. Lee Dyer, 40, from St Helens, Merseyside was stopped by Border Force officers at the Channel Tunnel terminal in Coquelles, France last May and told them he had been in Belgium doing plastering and collecting solar panels. Officers found boxes containing more than 100 wine bottles in the back of Dyer's van, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. The substance inside the bottles appeared oily and later checks showed the liquid tested positive for amphetamine. Dyer was arrested and checks on the van showed it had been hired in Warrington, with Dyer supplying the hire company with a false address. For previous trips he had also used hired vehicles, taking them abroad illegally. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne at street-level purity, with a potential street value of almost £8million. Last month, Dyer admitted importing controlling drugs and he was today sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne, with a potential street value of almost £8million . Matthew Rivers, from the NCA's Border Policing Command, said: 'The story Dyer told to explain his trips to the continent was a lie. Our investigation proved that in reality he was a professional courier who travelled to the Netherlands to source drugs. 'This was a huge quantity of amphetamine, enough to make many hundreds of thousands of street-level doses and fuel further criminal activity.' Paul Morgan, director of Border Force South East and Europe, said: 'This seizure means a significant quantity of drugs failed to reach the streets and demonstrates Border Force's commitment to keeping them out of the UK. 'We work closely with law enforcement colleagues, including the NCA, to prevent drug trafficking and do all we can to put those responsible behind bars.'

"(CNN)Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson will be reinstated as an active player by the NFL on Friday, the league said. The NFL suspended the 30-year-old football star in November over allegations that last May he disciplined his son, who was 4 at the time, too harshly with a ""switch,"" or thin stick. In a letter, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told Peterson that his continued participation in the league was contingent on a number of requirements, including that he maintain ""an ongoing program of counseling and treatment as recommended by medical advisers,"" the NFL said Thursday. Also required of Peterson: Avoiding ""any further conduct that violates the (NFL's) personal conduct policy or other NFL policies."" ""Any further violation of the personal conduct policy by Peterson would result in additional discipline, which could include suspension without pay or banishment from the NFL,"" the league said in a statement. Peterson played in one game last season, a 35-6 win against St. Louis in September, before the league put him on an exempt list September 17 -- keeping him off the field with pay -- in light of his indictment that month in the case. Initially charged with felony child abuse, Peterson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault in November in Texas. The NFL then suspended him without pay and he lost his appeal of that sanction the next month. In February, a Minnesota district court judge vacated the decision that upheld his suspension, making Peterson eligible for reinstatement. Bleacher Report: Latest details, comments, reaction . The Vikings issued a brief statement in which they said they ""look forward to Adrian rejoining the Vikings."" ESPN reported that the team will hold voluntary offseason workouts beginning Monday. The next Vikings' organized team activities begin in late May. It is unclear whether Peterson will attend. He has been unhappy with how the Vikings have handled the matter. Though Peterson dodged jail time with his no-contest plea, he received probation, community service and a $4,000 fine. He also will take parenting classes. ""I truly regret this incident,"" Peterson said after accepting the deal. ""I stand here and I take full responsibility for my actions. I love my son more than any one of you can even imagine."" Peterson is considered one of the best running backs in the NFL. In 2011 he signed a seven-year contract worth more than $100 million with the Vikings, who were 7-9 last season and failed to make the playoffs. In eight seasons, including last year's abbreviated year, he has rushed for 10,190 yards and averaged a strong 5.0 yards per carry. CNN's Jill Martin and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.

"Former PM Tony Blair was given an award for his 'global legacy' by Save the Children last year . Save the Children has apologised over its decision to give Tony Blair an award for his 'global legacy' after a furious public backlash. Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision, but insisted it was only meant to mark his work in Africa and not his entire time in Number 10. Mr Forsyth, a former Downing Street aide, admitted it would have been 'wrong' to give an award to the former PM for his political legacy rather than for his work on international aid. Mr Blair was handed an award for spending billions of taxpayers' money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year. The former PM, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid, was given the charity's Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development. But the award sparked widespread fury when it was announced in November. More than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the award to be rescinded and around 500 Saved the Children staff members have reportedly backed a similar petition. Questioned about the award on the BBC's Today programme this morning, Mr Forsyth said: 'I know that many of our supporters and volunteers were very upset and our staff, several of our staff too, and I'm very sorry for that.' He said the decision had been made by the British charity's 'sister organisation' in the US and insisted the award was only for his Africa work. Mr Forsyth said: 'Yes, it was a global legacy award. It was called that. But actually it was an award very, very specifically for Tony Blair's efforts on Africa at two G8 summits at Birmingham and Gleneagles, not his wider legacy. 'And if it had been for his wider legacy I think it would be wrong, but it was for something quite specific that helped Africa and children. 'I'm sorry it's upset so many people. It's not really what we do at Save the Children. What we're really doing is on the ground in Syria with the Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone – that's the work we do. 'This has been really an unnecessary distraction. I do apologise to those people that it's upset.' Justin Forsyth (left), the charity's chief executive pictured in Lebanon with Samantha Cameron, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision to honour Tony Blair . Mr Blair was handed the award for spending billions of public money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year - also attended by Mike Bezos (centre left), Dakota Fanning (centre right), and Nicholas Kristo (right) Mr Forsyth admitted the row had 'in part' damaged the charity in eyes of some staff but expressed hope people would accept organisations 'make mistakes'.

Save the Children has apologised over its decision to give Tony Blair an award for his 'global legacy' after a furious public backlash. Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision, but insisted it was only meant to mark his work in Africa and not his entire time in Number 10. Mr Forsyth, a former Downing Street aide, admitted it would have been 'wrong' to give an award to the former PM for his political legacy rather than for his work on international aid.

"A Danish tourist has died after trying to save a Michigan mayor from tempestuous waves on a beach in the Virgin Islands. South Lyon Mayor Tedd Wallace was pulled under the water while body-boarding in St Croix last Sunday. Rushing to his rescue was 70-year-old Gvind Matson, a Danish man on holiday with his wife to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their first kiss. Mr Wallace, 63, said Mr Matson also got caught in the choppy waters and as they both tried to cling to the board, he lost grip and never resurfaced. Rescue: Mayor Tedd Wallace (right) was caught up in waves when a Danish man (not pictured) called Gvind Matson rushed to save him. He too got caught and never resurfaced. Bale Shbaka Kaza (left) came to his aid . Tribute: Mr Wallace posted this tribute to Mr Matson on Sunday afternoon after speaking to his widow . 'He didn't hesitate and took off after me,' Mr Wallace told The Detroit News. 'When he got to me we were both hanging on to the board and trying to paddle towards shore. I don't think we even said anything to each other. Suddenly he let go and went under. I think he had a heart attack right then.' He added: 'I feel so sorry for that man. 'Someone who gave their life for me ... I've been doing a lot of crying this week.' Another man, Bale Shbaka Kaza, eventually spotted Mr Wallace and rescued him from the rocky-based ocean with bare feet. Mr Matson's widow, Annette, said he likely had an epileptic seizure. On holiday: Wallace says he cried a lot during the trip with his wife (left) after the tragic incident . Day job: Wallace, a 63-year-old retired teacher, is the mayor for east Michigan's South Lyons . Mr Wallace said the waves were so powerful they pulled off his wedding ring off his finger. Bale Shbaka Kaza, a local businessman from one of the island's larger cities, was able to pull Wallace to safety. Writing on Facebook, Mr Wallace, a retired teacher, said: 'I want to say thankyou to so many unbelievable good wishes sent me and for prayers offered to Danish man Gvind Matson and family in his valiant effort to rescue me from the rip tide. 'I am so sad. 'His widow Annette sent me a kind email and said he may have had epilepsy seizure at the moment he arrived to me explaining his sudden plunge below surface. 'Bale Shakabaka was my other hero who for reasons he can't figure why had climbed up on rocks and spotted the trouble and scaled 200 feet of sharp rocks in bare feet to reach out and save me. 'Thankyou (sic) for all concerned friends and strangers a like.'

"Arsenal are eyeing up a move for Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus to replace Theo Walcott. The England winger risked irking Arsene Wenger by claiming talks over a new deal have not started, despite the Gunners boss repeatedly stating the opposite. Wenger confirmed the club's intention to offer Walcott a new contract in February and when asked about whether talks had started on March 13, the Gunners boss replied: 'The first contacts have been made and we will see how that progresses.' However, Walcott, who currently earns £90,000-per-week, took to Twitter to contradict his manager. Arsenal are already looking at potential replacements for Theo Walcott, as his contract comes to an end . Walcott has not completed 90 minutes for his club since January 2014, and wants over £100,000 a week . Walcott has only recently returned from injury and is struggling to hold down a regular first-team place . In response to TV reports that he had been involved in a training-ground bust-up with Wenger, Walcott tweeted: 'I don't normally comment on false stories about myself but reports about contract demands and bust-ups with the boss are complete nonsense. 'There have been no contract talks as yet and my current focus is not on contracts but on doing my best for Arsenal FC.' Walcott's tweet made for an intriguing twist in what is already turning out to be another uncomfortable contract extension saga between Arsenal and the England international. The 26-year-old wants north of £100,000-per-week to sign a new contract at the Emirates Stadium. Given he is not a first-team regular, the Arsenal hierarchy are showing a reluctance to meet Walcott's pay demands. Likewise, Walcott is growing increasingly frustrated at his lack of game time since returning from a long-term knee injury. Walcott goes through his paces alongside fellow Arsenal and England star Kieran Gibbs on Thursday . Walcott, who is out of contract at the Emirates stadium next summer, trains alongside Harry Kane . The England winger took to social media to deny the claims that he and Arsene Wenger had fallen out . Walcott enters the final year of his contract at the end of the season and the Gunners will consider cashing in on the speedster in the summer, for a fee of around £15million, to avoid losing him for nothing in 2016. And Sportsmail understands the club have already started identifying targets to replace Walcott if the contract stand-off cannot be resolved. Dortmund forward Reus will lead the list of candidates to fill Walcott's shoes if he leaves north London this summer. Theo Walcott has denied a bust-up with Arsenal over his new contract negotiations . Arsenal could turn their attentions back to Marco Reus if Walcott were to leave in the summer . Reus, who scored for Germany against Australia on Wednesday, has long been a favourite of Wenger . The Gunners failed in an attempt to sign the Germany international last summer, but retain a strong interest. The club's global network of spies have been instructed to pinpoint potential candidates should Walcott leave. Given Walcott's

"American Airlines has refunded a family's ticket for their daughter who died after a public outcry following their initial refusal to do so. Madison 'Scout' Cantrell, 9, died tragically from an asthma attack that led to cardiac arrest five months ago, sending her family into deep and sudden grief. The Cantrells,from St Charles, a suburb of Chicago, had been planning a trip to Bald Head, North Carolina this month, but decided to call it off. Scout's sister Katie, 13, said going to their traditional family vacation spot would be too emotionally painful. American Airlines refused to offer a refund for Scout's seat, transfer the ticket to someone else or issue a voucher. Scroll down for video . American Airlines originally refused to refund the ticket of Madison 'Scout' Cantrell, 9, who died in October after an asthma attack led to cardiac arrest . Felicity Cantrell, Scout's mother, applied for a refund and sent in a death certificate but was told that the documents did not 'meet exception requirements' The airline's website says that a travel vouches are given to family members of passengers who die before their flight. Felicity Cantrell, Scout's mother, said on Facebook that she had sent in the required documentation and death certificate, but posted a letter from the company denying her request for a refund. The callous letter said 'the request does not meet our exception requirements' and that the fee for changing the flight would be waived 'as a one-time courtesy.'

However, she added that her conversation with the manager was genuine and that he was 'thoroughly embarrassed and horrified by this whole situation'.

"North Charleston police are facing growing accusations that killer cop Michael Slager would have got away with a cover up had a bystander video not emerged - as questions emerge over his colleagues' conduct after the shooting. Seven of Slager's fellow cops responded to his call forback-up after the shooting - as handcuffed Walter Scott lay dead or dying with five bullet wounds to the back. But the fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting given to the media, or in the force's incident report filed after the shooting. Officers also told an internal report that they gave Scott CPR, but the video only shows them checking his pulse and standing over his body. One officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body. Scroll down for video . Questions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPR . Scott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.' Slager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened. 'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser — as trained by the department — and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said. 'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.' On Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation. There are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows. It is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation. The video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground. As Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body. Haberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away. Radio records show that an officer reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back. Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down. The same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed is two sentences. The second reads: 'I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and

"The President and First Lady both filmed TV appearances in Burbank, California on Thursday - but billed taxpayers for two separate private flights to get there. Barack Obama took Air Force One to LAX, at a cost of more than $1million, so he could be on Jimmy Kimmel Live. But, rather than ride with him, Michelle Obama chartered a different, earlier plane for a slot on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, filmed in the same LA suburb as Kimmel's program. Scroll down for video . Obamas' day out: The president goofed around on-screen with Jimmy Kimmel, left, while the First Lady flew to California to give Ellen DeGeneres a hug (right) Busting moves on our dime: Michelle Obama took a different flight to her husband to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres show and dance to Uptown Funk . Tough at the top: Barack Obama took some time to read insulting tweets about himself on the show . Despite the closeness, the White House has insisted that the pair's schedules 'were not in sync', CNN reported. The Commander-in-Chief used his time on the airwaves to read out mean tweets about himself, while Mrs Obama busted dance moves alongside DeGeneres to the tune of Uptown Funk. Obama's episode of Kimmel has aired already, while the full DeGeneres show is due on Monday. White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz defended the arrangement to a group of reporters on Air Force One. No room for Michelle: The president took Air Force One for the TV appearance, at an estimated cost of more than $1million . Low-key: Obama took Marine One, background, from LAX to Burbank airport . He said: 'I believe on this occasion the schedules were not in sync to travel together... I'm not even sure they overlapped.' Obama's visit was also occasion for a host of obvious - and expensive - security measures. When the president took a helicopter from LAX to Burbank airport, he was accompanied by three military choppers. A team of snipers was also dispatched to Los Angles to guard the president, who took a 40-car motorcade from Burbank's airport to Kimmel's studio. Entourage: These black-clad security men were on the tarmac in Los Angeles as part of Obama's detail . The Obamas are not thought to have seen one other at all in California. The president flew on to Phoenix on Friday afternoon, while the First Lady returned to the White House Thursday. Air Force One costs more than $200,000 an hour to fly, meaning the tab for Obama's flight to Los Angeles will have passed the $1million mark by itself. The specifics of the First Lady's travel arrangements are not clear, though it is likely to have stacked tens of thousands of dollars on to the overall cost. It is not the first time the First Family has come under scrutiny for drafting multiple planes for very similar trips. A 2011 summer jaunt to Martha's Vineyard saw the President take Air Force One solo to the famous golfing spot. Michelle, Sasha and Malia followed in a separate jet just

"A Labour frontbencher has expressed regret that the party cannot ‘get rid’ of the Trident nuclear deterrent. Shadow Welsh secretary Owen Smith said at a hustings event on Wednesday: ‘We view the world as being a very dangerous and volatile place at the moment. So our policy is that we will retain Trident, we will maintain a continuous at-sea deterrent.’ But he added: ‘So we will pursue an independent perspective, the next Labour government, but on the issue of Trident: would but we could get rid of it but I fear that we can’t.’ Shadow Welsh secretary Owen Smith has expressed regret that the party cannot ‘get rid’ of the Trident nuclear deterrent . Around three quarters of Labour candidates back scrapping Trident, which preserves a round-the-clock protection at sea in case of a nuclear strike. But the party has committed to maintaining the deterrent, which will need to be replaced in the coming years, in its election manifesto. The Tories have warned that Labour could ‘sell out’ Britain in a deal with the SNP which wants to scrap Trident. Replacing the deterrent with a ‘like for like’ system would cost around £100bn.

"(CNN)On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's ""Strike Hard"" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat ""terrorism"" and ""separatism."" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide. Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows. Iran and Iraq executed people for ""terrorism,"" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime. In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety ""national emergency."" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool. The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when

"(CNN)A grand jury in Dallas County, Texas, has decided not to indict two officers in the fatal shooting of Jason Harrison, a schizophrenic man whose mother had called police for help getting him to the hospital. ""This particular case was reported out as a 'no bill,' from the grand jury,"" said Cristal Retana, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County District Attorney's Office. The grand jury's decision not to indict means Officers John Rogers and Andrew Hutchins won't face criminal prosecution in the case. But the officers are still facing a wrongful death lawsuit from Harrison's family. The incident occurred in June, and Harrison's family filed a lawsuit in November. The release of video from one of the officer's body cameras put the shooting back in the headlines last month. In it, Harrison's mother answers the door for police and nonchalantly walks outside. ""Oh, he's just off the chain,"" she says. ""You can hear him, talking about chopping up people."" It was a fairly routine occurrence for her to call the police for assistance with her son. An officer asks who she's talking about, and she replies, ""My son, bipolar, schizo,"" as Jason Harrison appears in the doorway behind her. He is twiddling a screwdriver between his fingers. One of the two officers called to the scene tells Harrison to drop the tool, a command the officers repeat at least four times as Harrison's mom screams, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" Within five seconds of that first command, the 39-year-old schizophrenic man is shot five times -- including twice in the back as he crashes headlong into the home's garage door, just a few feet from his mother. Video from one officer's body camera fades to black as Harrison's mother wails, ""Oh, they killed my son! Oh, they killed my son!"" The officers continue to tell Harrison to drop the weapon. The Harrison family's lawsuit against Rogers and Hutchins says they should have used nonlethal means of defusing the situation instead of choosing to engage ""in unlawful vicious attacks"" when they and the department were aware of Harrison's condition. The suit also claims the officers violated Harrison's civil rights. The officers, however, said in affidavits that they were forced to shoot an armed man who they deemed dangerous after he failed to comply with repeated orders to drop a screwdriver. CNN's Matthew Stucker and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

"Father Tony McSweeney, 68, watched as care home manager John Stingemore, his paedophile friend, fondled a teenager in the shower of Grafton Close Children’s Home . The 'Fat Vicar' who conducted Frank Bruno's wedding has been jailed for three years for abusing a boy at a children's home. Father Anthony McSweeney was locked up after the court rejected his claim that his 20st size meant he could not have molested boys as they sat on his lap. The 68-year-old, who officiated at the boxer's wedding to ex-wife Laura, watched as care home manager John Stingemore, his paedophile friend, fondled a teenager in the shower of Grafton Close Children’s Home in Hounslow, west London, between 1979 and 1981. The Catholic clergyman, once part-time chaplain at Norwich City FC, also collected vile child porn over ‘decades’ and was caught with a drawer crammed with sex toys by his cleaner, Southwark Crown Court heard. McSweeney was leading the congregation at St George’s Church in north Norwich when the claims against him emerged in 2013. He was originally charged with Stingemore, 72, but the care home manager died weeks before the trial was due to start. McSweeney’s 15-year-old victim remembered a ‘massive’ trainee priest who was a ‘right bulk’ visiting Grafton Close. Together with Stingemore, McSweeney forced the young teenager to expose himself to them and touched him under the pretence of making sure he was ‘clean’ four or five times. ‘This was joint enterprise by both men to use the victim for their own sexual gratification,’ said prosecutor Sarah Plaschkes QC. ‘On a number of occasions this defendant, together with the officer in charge of the home John Stingemore, would be present when the victim was in the bathroom. ‘Mr Stingemore would touch him by, in his words, lifting his balls and making him bend over.’ The men groomed the ‘vulnerable’ and ‘isolated’ boy by using the washing routine to ‘confuse the child’ and to hide their true motivation. Both pensioners were accused of targeting children while Stingemore, of Stonehouse Drive, St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, was in charge of the council-run home. The disgraced clergyman was found guilty of one count of indecent assault. Together with Stingemore (pictured), McSweeney forced the young teenager to expose himself to them and touched him under the pretence of making sure he was ‘clean’ four or five times .

He was further found guilty of three charges of making indecent photographs of children after sickening images of sexual abuse were discovered on his Dell laptop dating between 2012 and 2013. He was cleared of three counts of indecent assault and one of taking an indecent photograph of a child relating to two boys who lived in the home he volunteered in. McSweeney sat open-mouthed as he was jailed for three years for his crimes. Judge McCreath explained the clergyman ’was prosecuted and convicted on a joint enterprise basis and

"Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10, low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers. Handed in a latter: General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander .

"Sergio Ramos was the first man Carlo Ancelotti embraced at the final whistle of Real Madrid’s dramatic Champions League win over Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Asked after the game when it was that he had decided to move the defender forward into midfield to cover the absence of Luka Modric, he replied: ‘The minute after I found out Modric was injured’. The two kept it between themselves and it worked on the night. Ramos is one of those players for whom the old Liverpool song about Jamie Carragher ‘We all dream of a team of Carraghers’ would be appropriate. He could play in every single position on the pitch. Sergio Ramos (left) celebrates with Javier Hernandez (centre) and Pepe after Real's winning goal . Ramos gees up the crowd during another all-action display at the Santiago Bernabeu for Real Madrid . It was a fiery Madrid derby on Wednesday night, but Ramos (left) once again proved his worth to Real . He often fools around in goal at Spain training. He started his Real Madrid career as a right back and won the European Championship there for his country. He has filled in at left-back, can play across the midfield and actually started his youth football career as striker. Had he been born British he would probably have grown up as a box-to-box midfielder. In Spain midfielders who have pace and can head and tackle often end up at centre-back and that is where he has settled. On Wednesday when his team needed him he was pitched into midfield and he let no-one down. And that’s the thing about Ramos. He very rarely lets anyone down. He is Real Madrid’s Carles Puyol – the all-action hero who rises above everyone else in in the penalty area in the Champions League final and heads in a corner that equalises Atletico Madrid’s 1-0 lead in injury time, allowing Real to play out extra-time and score three more to lift the trophy. Ramos heads away from his own penalty area, but spent most of the game marshalling the midfield . The makeshift midfielder holds off Atletico Madrid's Koke during a superb display in the middle of the park . And when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against Bayern Munich in 2010 in the Champions League semi-final when he sent his kick – at least as far as Twitter was concerned – into outer space, he has the guts to take another one in the European Championship final a couple of months later, and not only score but dink it Panenka style over the keeper’s dive. He has been mocked in the past for his Colemanballs comments that usually amount to declaring himself ‘happy with the three points’ after a cup game or ‘looking forward to the second leg’ after a league game, but even those who have in the past mocked him have come to admire him. It always seemed that even Jose Mourinho during his fall-out with Iker Casillas could never really properly fall out with Casillas' ally Ramos

"A self-confessed neo-Nazi who allegedly shot dead his gay supervisor was forcibly removed from court on Thursday after swearing at the judge and flipping over a table. The outburst unfolded as Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, made his first appearance at the Wayne County Courthouse in Goldsboro, North Carolina after being extradited from Florida. He is accused of shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane at Wayne Community College on Monday morning before fleeing more than 500 miles south. He was arrested sleeping on Daytona Beach on Tuesday. At the hearing on Thursday, he initially denied a court-appointed attorney, saying he knew he'd get life behind bars when he shot dead his former boss. Scroll down for video . Kicked out: Kenneth Stancil is removed from a Wayne County courtroom in Goldsboro, North Carolina on Thursday after he swore at the judge and claimed he shot dead a man for trying to molest his brother . When the judge repeatedly reminded him that he could get the death penalty for his charge of open murder, Stancil burst into expletives, WNCN reported. 'Yes I know that,' Stancil snapped back. 'But when I knew what I had to do and I knew I got caught, I knew in my mind that I could get life or I could get the death penalty. I knew that.' He then repeated his previous claims that he targeted Lane for making sexual advances towards Stancil's 16-year-old brother. He has said Lane did not touch the boy but intended to. 'You defile my top eight, I will kill you,' Stancil told the court on Thursday. 'Know what I'm saying? If you're a f***ing child molester, a f***ing rapist.' When Judge Ronald O. Jones told him to stop using that language, he answered: 'I don't give a f*** what you want'. Jones ordered him to be removed from the courtroom but Stancil was able to flip over a table before deputies pounced on him and hauled him away. When he returned about 30 minutes later, his demeanor was very different, WNCN noted. He told the judge he would like an attorney and one will be appointed to him on Friday. In court: Stancil, who has multiple neo-Nazi tattoos, made his first appearance in the North Carolina courtroom on Thursday after he was transferred from Florida, where he was arrested on Tuesday .

"Marcelo insists Real Madrid's this season's meetings with local rivals Atletico Madrid will have no bearing on the outcome of their Champions League quarter-final tie. The reigning champions face Diego Simeone's side at Vicente Calderon on Tuesday night in the first leg of the last eight clash having failed to beat their neighbours in six attempts this season. Carlo Ancelotti's side lost both La Liga matches against Atletico this season - 2-1 at the Bernabeu before a humiliating 4-0 away defeat - and have also been beaten twice and held to two draws in the Spanish Supper Cup and the Copa del Rey.

Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo looked relaxed in training on Monday ahead of Tuesday's first leg . Brazil international Marcelo faces the media on Monday ahead of Tuesday's match at Vicente Calderon . But Brazil international Marcelo says he and his team-mates are not thinking about their recent form against Tuesday's opponents. 'We have played against Atletico a lot and something always changes,' Marcelo told reporters at a press conference on Monday. There are no favourites in a match like this. We will give everything on the pitch without thinking about previous games.' 'They are a great team. They never stop fighting and they are very intense. But we are not thinking about the last games against them. Now is completely different. We have two games to show that we can beat them.' Ronaldo and Bale leave the field dejected after Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Atletico in February . The last time Real Madrid beat their local rivals was in the Champions League final last season . Carlo Ancelotti and Marcelo task questions at the pre-match press conference . 'We have to go out and give everything on the pitch this time. We will have to be very intense. We will have to fight. These derbies are very difficult.' The last time Real beat Atletico was in last season's Champions League final when Sergio Ramos scored in the 93rd minute to take the game to extra-time, before Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo made it 4-1. 'I don't know how many times we have spoken about Ramos' Decima goal this week,' Marcelo added. 'I was available for the final and I never lost faith in helping the team. That's what happened and I was able to help the team win the Champions League. I consider myself very important in this team.'

"A top contender in a major dog sled race in Alaska was disqualified on Tuesday evening for carrying an iPod touch. Brent Sass of Eureka was told he violated Rule 35 of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which prohibits cellphones and other two-way communication devices with wireless capability. The 35-year-old musher was running fifth place and a quarter of the way through the 979-mile contest when he was pulled off the course. Scroll down for video . Still smiling: Brent Sass of Eureka (right) was disqualified on Tuesday evening from the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race for carrying an iPod touch . Sass told the Alaska Dispatch News that he had no idea that he was doing anything wrong. 'I didn’t use [the iPod touch] and I had zero intent of using it for a Wi-Fi connection in checkpoints, but I was just completely clueless,' he said. 'I mean I gave my dad my cell phone because I knew you couldn’t have cell phones on this race specifically and I was just ignorant.' Sebastian Schnuelle, a Canadian dog musher and dog sled racer from Whitehorse, Yukon, who is not running in this year's Iditarod described Sass' disqualification as 'disappointment'. The 35-year-old musher was running fifth place and a quarter of the way through the 979-mile contest when he was pulled off the course (Rohn Buser's lead dogs pictured above) Ready, set: People stand near the start area during the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Monday in Fairbanks . 'He was running a great team,' Schnuelle added. Sass, owner and founder of Wild and Free Mushing, has been racing and training huskies for 12 years. Originally from Excelsior, Minnesota, Sass moved to Alaska in 1998 to 'fulfill a lifelong dream' of living in the state. He attended the University of Alaska Fairbanks where he graduated with a major in geography and started mushing shortly after. Weather impacts: Iditarod mushers began their 1,000-mile trek across Alaska along a new route after poor trail conditions forced organizers to push the race's start north, bypassing a mountain range . Career high: Musher Timothy Hunt waits for his turn near the start area during the Iditarod . Since his first race in 2006, Sass has placed in over 20 races, including several first place finishes. Last month he won 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race. The Iditarod began Monday in Fairbanks and will finish in Nome. Aliy Zirkle of Two Rivers was in the lead 227 miles into the race Tuesday at the Tanana checkpoint, where Sass is currently resting. The fastest winning record was set in 2014 by Dallas Seavey with a time of eight days, 13 hours, four minutes, and 19 seconds.

"A Tory MP has urged his supporters not to 'mention the Conservative Party or David Cameron' when sending out letters in support of him. Gavin Barwell, who is fighting the key London marginal of Croydon, has asked constituents to sign letters to friends and neighbours supporting his re-election. But Mr Barwell was left red-faced after it emerged he sent out 'sample' letters designed to make it look like they were written by ordinary constituents. Gavin Barwell, who is fighting the key London marginal of Croydon, has asked constituents to sign letters to friends and neighbours supporting his re-election . The letters, seen by the Evening Standard, all appeared to be written in exactly the same style. They were full of similar phrases – with each beginning with 'Dear neighbour' and went on to describe an incident where Mr Barwell helped them. They often ended with the phrase: 'I really can't recommend Gavin strongly enough.' In a letter to constituents asking them to endorse him, Mr Barwell writes: 'I'm not asking you to write a political letter — in fact, it'll be much more effective if it doesn't mention the Conservative Party or David Cameron.' Asked if he or his team wrote the sample letters, he said: 'People write their own letters, I've not written anything. These are genuine constituents that we have helped who wanted to write a letter. I think in one case we helped with the drafting. They are not fake letters.' 'I'm therefore writing to ask if you would be prepared to write to people in your neighbourhood saying why you think I am a good local MP.' One Labour MP compared his letter with the bungling Fawlty Towers manager Basil Fawlty telling staff 'don't mention the war' in front of German guests. Mr Barwell has urged his supporters not to 'mention the Conservative Party or David Cameron' when sending out letters in support of him . Labour MP Stephen Pound mocked: 'It's a case of 'Don't mention the Tories!' Mr Barwell insisted he just did not want the endorsements to be too political and that he had put Mr Cameron on his own leaflets. He said: 'The purpose is not to send political letters. The purpose of the letters is a personal endorsement of my work as MP. 'My own election leaflets will be full of mentions of both David Cameron and the Conservative Party. 'These letters are different. They are from ordinary people telling their story. I don't think people doing that will be comfortable making party political points.' But Sarah Jones, the Labour candidate for Croydon Central, told the Standard: 'It's a sign of real desperation that Gavin Barwell is actively telling people not to call him a Tory. He's trying to pull the wool over people's eyes. 'If people were wondering if the Tory brand had become toxic in Croydon, he's the proof you need. 'However hard he tries, he can't run away from his voting record — voting for deep cuts, privatisation of the NHS, the bedroom tax and trebling tuition fees.'

"Rafa Benitez is what he is; an excellent cup manager. He proved this yet again on Thursday, when his Napoli side blitzed past Europa League favourites Wolfsburg by four goals to one on the Germans' home turf. But despite managing some of the continent's most established clubs since leaving Valencia just over a decade ago - Liverpool, Inter, Chelsea (albeit on an interim basis) and Napoli - he has amassed a grand total of zero league titles. Benitez famously guided Liverpool to the Champions League in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes . Benitez remains popular at Anfield, but when he left there were few regrets over his departure . Donovan Chandler is a Liverpool fan writer on 90min.com . At Anfield, we will be eternally grateful for the Champions League trophy he delivered in 2005, in spite of possessing what was, on paper at least, our worst accumulation of players in recent history. Djimi Traore, Antonio Nunez, Milan Baros and Igor Biscan - cult hero that he was - were all part of that unfathomably successful squad. All four were dispensed of either that summer or the one that followed. Two years after Instanbul, Benitez was (almost) at it again with a side that better resembled the one he would have wanted, though it wasn't quite good enough to overcome an improved AC Milan side on this occasion. For all the Spaniard's successes, he also brought in the hapless Djimi Traore and Czech forward Milan Baros . And although we ran Manchester United a close second two seasons after that, we actually ended up further away from the Premier League title than we had been in a number of years during his final campaign (2009-10) - a failure that signalled the end to an Anfield tenure that also yielded our last FA Cup. In between, he lumbered us with the Josemi's, Albert Riera's and Phillipp Degen's of this world; none of us had many regrets over his departure - except, of course, that it was the catalyst for our introduction to Roy Hodgson. Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006 on penalties against West Ham . With Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard playing well together, Benitez got close to the title, but never won it . And for all his moments, I fully believe we are on the right track again under Brendan Rodgers, even if we can't quite clutch that final Champions League spot this season - or miss out on the FA Cup. That's why, if Rafa returns to England again in the summer - as is being speculated due to Napoli's Serie A shortcomings this season - it will receive little more than a shrug from large sections of the Kop. His league failings mean he is unlikely to be sworn in at any of our top-four rivals, unless Manchester City need someone to keep the seat warm for their dream conquest Pep Guardiola. Liverpool's failure in the Premier League means that Benitez will always be remembered as a cup specialist . As far as my

"Hong Kong (CNN)Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media. The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.

"(CNN)In an audio message purportedly from an ISIS spokesman, the group announced that a pledge of allegiance from Nigerian-based Boko Haram has been accepted by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The 28-minute message, which cannot be independently authenticated by CNN, was posted online by ISIS supporters. The message says that the caliphate, or Islamic State, has expanded to western Africa and congratulated ""our jihadi brothers"" there. The spokesman, Abu Mohammed al Adnani, encourages people to join fighters in Africa if they cannot make it to Iraq or Syria. Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, announced in an audio message last week that the Islamist terror group was going to ally with ISIS. Jacob Zenn, a terror expert who lives in Nigeria, told CNN on Saturday the alliance would make sense for both groups. ""Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands,"" Zenn said. ""It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS's biggest affiliate. ""ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate."" Boko Haram, whose name translates as ""Western education is sin,"" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. What Boko Haram's pledge of allegiance to ISIS means .

At least Button saw the chequered flag, describing it at the time as 'a small victory', albeit finishing two laps down on race-winner Lewis Hamilton in 11th and last place. Despite McLaren's seemingly hopeless position heading into Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix, a positive Button can see hope on the horizon. 'We're a hell of a long way behind, but I feel we have something we can mould into something very special in the future, which is very exciting,' said Button. 'Being 1.5 seconds off the pace and knowing you've peaked with your package, that's got to hurt. 'Whereas at least we have a glimmer of hope we can possibly challenge Mercedes one day.' Asked as to the reasoning behind his belief, Button replied: 'The direction with the car in terms of aerodynamics, but also with how aggressive this engine is, which is why we're having so many issues. 'In many ways - it's probably wrong for me to say - it's probably more like a Mercedes than it is the other two manufacturers (Ferrari and Renault) in terms of design, aggressiveness and packaging. Lewis Hamilton sprays champagne from the podium after winning the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton led team-mate Nico Rosberg home in Melbourne as Mercedes dominated the opening race of 2015 . 'It's just going to take a little bit of time, but if we didn't have that hope you wouldn't see the strong effort by the whole team. 'They're not heading to races because they're paid to, they're doing so because they're passionate about racing. They're looking forward to the future as much as I am.' The one bonus for McLaren this weekend is Alonso is poised to return, pending a final medical check by the FIA at the Sepang International Circuit on Thursday. Racing director Eric Boullier, for one, is happy to have the Spaniard back on board as he said: 'I'm pleased to see Fernando back in the car. 'He's raring to go, and I know he's been working hard behind the scenes to prepare himself for this weekend.' Fernando Alonso is poised to return to the McLaren cockpit providing he passes an FIA medical on Thursday .

"These pictures show the moment a weasel bit off more than it could chew when it made the unwise decision to attack a heron. The aggressive mammal was seen leaping up and biting the large bird's beak, with the move quickly backfiring for the weasel who did not live to tell the tale. After deciding enough was enough, the heron scooped up the critter in its mouth and flew to a nearby lake to drown it, dipping the weasel underwater twice to make sure it was dead. Clinging on: This aggressive weasel was drowned by a heron after the mammal annoyed the bird by attacking it and biting its large beak . Pick on someone your own size: The weasel was pictured biting the heron's beak as it bit off more than it could chew by taking on the large bird . Going down: The annoyed heron decided enough was enough, picking up the weasel in its beak and flying to a nearby lake to drown it . Dunk: The large bird plunged the mammal into the water twice, holding it underneath the surface until it had drowned . The photographs, taken by bird watcher Jonathan Forgham, show nature at its most brutal as the heron gobbled down the weasel in one gulp. Mr Forgham was leaving Elmley Nature Reserve on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, after spending three hours photographing owls when he spotted the weasel attacking the heron. He said: 'I got my car closer and could see the weasel attacking the bird. At that point the heron wasn't trying to eat it, it was just trying to get rid of it. But the weasel attacked its beak again and the heron picked it up and flew of to the pond. 'I drove the car round there in time to see the heron try to drown the weasel. It lifted it out of the water and then dunked it again to make sure it was dead. 'When the weasel was quite motionless the heron swallowed it. Afterwards it didn't do much, it just stood there looking quite smug. 'I have been bird watching all my life and have seen a heron eat ducklings and a snake before but never anything as big as a weasel. The photographs were taken by bird watcher Jonathan Forgham at Elmley Nature Reserve on the Isle of Sheppey, in Kent . Bird watcher Mr Forgham said the weasel's attack 'wasn't very wise', however they have a reputation for being aggressive . Gulp: The heron, seen with the weasel's bite marks on its beak, gobbled its motionless dinner down in one go once it was sure it was dead . Hold on! The pictures come days after a weasel was pictured clinging on to a flying woodpecker after pouncing on top of the bird . 'It wasn't very wise of the weasel to go after a heron but they are aggressive, never give up and fight to the death. You could see bite marks on the heron's beak.

"Eight animals are dead, including at least one alligator that once belonged to Michael Jackson, after a fire last week destroyed two enclosures at a zoological park in Oklahoma. Authorities suspect an arsonist is to blame for the March 26 fire that left seven alligators and a crocodile 'boiled to death' at the Garold Wayne Interactive Zoological Park, News OK reports. The fire was set in the early morning hours that March day and Joe Schreibvogel, the founder of the zoo, said not only did the alleged criminal set the fire, but also stole a large amount of equipment Schreibvogel used to record his independently produced television show, JoeExotic TV. Alligators: At least one of Michael Jackson's alligators (photographed) from his Neverland Ranch died ina fire at the Garold Wayne Interactive Zoological Park in Oklahoma . Escaped: Eight animals died in the fire that destroyed two reptiles enclosures and one alligator reportedly escaped . 'This was personal,' he told News OK. 'They targeted the studio to shut me up. They wanted to get me off the air...or else they would’ve targeted something else [in the Park].' In addition to destroying the two reptile enclosures, the fire also destroyed a video production studio. Garvin County Sheriff Larry Rhodes told KJRH that the fire was arson and most likely an attempt to cover up a burglary or theft. Only one alligator escaped the blaze. KJRH reports that one alligator that reportedly belonged to the self-proclaimed King of Pop suffered severe smoke inhalation but is in recovery. Destroyed: Not only did the alleged criminal set the fire, but also stole a large amount of equipment Joe Schreibvogel, the founder of the zoo, used to record his independently produced television show, JoeExotic TV . Arson: Officials say an arson investigator has not officially declared the incident a case of arson, but has ruled out other likely causes like electrical issues and lightning from recent storms in the area . All Times: Schreibvogel said that, despite the fire, the park will remain open but armed security guards will be on duty at all times . Schreibvogel told News OK he is often targeted by animal rights groups and extremists, calling them 'animal terroristst.' He said it is an 'ongoing pattern,' noting that he has received threats before. 'It is more of disgust,' He told KJRH of his feelings toward the incident. 'If somebody has an issue with the zoo or an issue with me personally then take it up with me. 'These animals didn't deserved to be burned to death.' Rhodes told News OK that an arson investigator has not officially declared the incident a case of arson, but has ruled out other likely causes like electrical issues and lightning from recent storms in the area. King of Pop: After the worldwide mega-star died in 2009, the animals that made up his massive menagerie were spread across the U.S. to animals preserves, sanctuaries, and animal enthusiasts . No one has been arrested or charged in the case. Schreibvogel, who reportedly filed for bankruptcy in 2013, said repairs

"If Wigan Athletic are to be relegated from the Sky Bet Championship, then their new manager Gary Caldwell would want to see them go down kicking and screaming. Martyn Waghorn took that a little too literally against Millwall, his red card for a senseless kick at Dan Harding punished by a Lions side determined to avoid a similar fate. When Waghorn, who played for Millwall on loan from Leicester in 2013, lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour, it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points. And they were duly delivered when Jimmy Abdou headed home Harding’s cross with 15 minutes remaining, sending a febrile Den into raptures. Millwall team-mates rush to congratulate substitute Magaye Gueye after he scored their second goal . Lions No 1 David Forde celebrates after Jimmy Abdou came on to break the deadlock with a rare strike . Martyn Waghorn was one of three players sent off - two for Wigan and one for Millwall in the fiesty clash . Millwall: Forde (c); Cummings, Nelson, Beevers, Harding; Upson, Abdou, Williams (Bailey 42), Martin (Gueye 68); O’Brien (Woolford 84), Gregory . Substitutes not used: Archer (GK); Cowan-Hall, Fuller, Taylor-Fletcher . Scorers: Abdou 75; Gueye 90+3 . Booked: Gregory, Martin, Bailey, Beevers . Sent off: Upson . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Pennant (Chow 81), Perch (c), Kvist (Ojo 90+1), Kim Bo-Kyung, McLean; Fortune (Waghorn 53) Substitutes not used: Al Habsi (GK); McCann, Barnett, Murphy . Booked: Bong, Bo-Kyung . Sent off: Waghorn, Pearson . Referee: Stephen Martin (Staffordshire) In his six seasons at the club, that was only Abdou’s seventh goal. What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn’t a misprint. There was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O’Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall’s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction. The game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm. And a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson. Millwall’s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night. The plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points. Harris had described this match as a ‘Cup Final’ and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell’s men. Wigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall .

"(CNN)Back in 2010 Britain's politicians broke new ground. They were long used to haranguing each other in the UK's rowdy House of Commons -- but they'd never had American style pre-election head-to-head debates. It is necessary and long-established political fare in the U.S. -- but over here in the UK, it was novel. It seemed to go well -- political points were scored, and polls were commissioned looking for advantages gained or lost. It was a drama of sorts, even though no knock-out punches were landed. Prime Minister David Cameron and his Conservative party won the election, but not by enough to go into government alone. For the past five years he's been governing in coalition with the UK's third party, the Liberal Democrats. And their leader, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, has mostly backed Cameron in Parliamentary debates against the opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband. Britain's broadcasters, keen to channel lively politics onto prime time TV and boost ratings, have been working the corridors of power themselves over the past year to try to nail down a repeat -- or two -- of the 2010 knockabout. What's at stake isn't just the proposed debates ahead of May's general election -- but the enshrining of such debates permanently into Britain's political architecture -- just like in the U.S. But while Cameron and Miliband have hired former White House election advisers to edge them in to the lead, no one can agree on what form a debate should take, how many there should be, or even who should be invited. Cameron has insisted on just one debate involving the leaders of seven leading UK parties -- giving equal airtime to the Greens, the Scottish Nationalists and the upstart rightwing UK Independence Party (UKIP), among others. But Miliband's Labour party is holding out for at least one head-to-head debate with Cameron. No one seems to be budging but both of the UK's largest parties could use the bump in the polls such a debate might bring. Part of the problem is the British electorate, which has changed since 2010, boosting the fortunes of some of the country's former political outliers. The rightwing UKIP, which has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union, has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of Cameron's Conservatives. In Scotland, the September independence referendum (which narrowly failed) so reinvigorated the Scottish National Party that they could hit what is usually a key Labour stronghold, undermining Miliband's bid for power. All of this has made the whole process of nailing down precisely who will be allowed in the debate that much more tortuous. For the big leaders who drive that conversation, it is about how each outlier can help them -- and hinder their rivals. It once looked like it would become as much of a British institution as rain, or fish and chips, but now the election debate seems in danger of not happening at all. On the upside, you can still tune in to House of Commons TV most days

"Manchester United defender Chris Smalling took a trip down memory lane as the 25-year-old went back to his old judo club. Photos of the visit, during which he presented some members with replica United jerseys, were posted on the International Judo Federation's official Twitter account alongside a flashback picture of Smalling as a youngster. The England international, who only made the decision to join the social networking site on Friday, excelled at the martial art as a teen and was even named national champion for his age group, before football took precedence at 15. The International Judo Federation shares pictures of Chris Smalling taking the time to visit his old club . Smalling was a gifted martial artist and was at one stage named national judo champion for his age group . The Manchester United defender presents some replica jerseys to some of the members of the club . Smalling began his footballing career with minnows Maidstone United in Kent, before a string of impressive performances saw him snapped up by then Premier League side Fulham in 2008. After only a handful appearances for the Cottagers, his talent was clear and Smalling signed for Manchester United one year later. It has been a remarkable rise for the former Chatham Grammar School student, who if football had not worked out, was set to study Business Management at Loughborough University, having gained a decent set of A-Levels. Smalling will be hoping to make manager Louis van Gaal's starting line up for the crunch clash with local rivals Manchester City this weekend, as United aim to finish the league campaign in the top-four.

"They have eluded explorers, hunters and scientists who have been searching the Himalayan mountains for the mysterious yeti for over a century. Now it seems we are no closer to knowing what creature lies behind the mysterious sightings and footprints that have led to the legend of the Abominable Snowman. A key piece of evidence that suggested many of the sightings were due to an unknown type of bear living in the Himalaya has now been ruled out. This footprint taken by British explorer Eric Shipton in 1954 is regarded as one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of a yeti and new research on hair samples shows that the mystery is far from being solved . Biologists used DNA analysis to examine claims that hair samples attributed to yetis appeared to belong to a scientifically undiscovered species of bear.

The researchers conclude, however, that from the colour and shape of the hair samples, they were likely to have come from common Himalayan brown bears rather than an unknown species of bear. This means that the identity of the species behind yeti sightings is still a mystery. Dr Eliécer Gutiérrez, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian Institution, said one of the hair samples had apparently come from a bear that had been shot by hunters. He said: 'We have concluded that there is no reason to believe that the two samples came from anything other than Brown Bears. 'What strikes us as odd is that an “experienced hunter”, who was very familiar with the Brown Bear, could mistake the animal that he had shot for anything other than a bear

"A cat has laid a claim to having the loudest purr in the world because she makes noises as loud as a Tube train. 12-year-old Bluey has a growl which is louder than most cats can miaow, and has reached a maximum of 93 decibels - more than the official world record holder. Despite her fearsome sound, Bluey is said to be gentle and loving, and is currently in a rehoming centre in Cambridge looking for a new owner. Scroll down for video . Noisy: Bluey the cat could have the loudest purr in the world, according to staff at a rehoming centre . Claire Thomas, from the Blue Cross charity, said: 'We've never had a cat in our care with a purr as loud as Bluey's. 'We thought it would be fun to see just how loud it is so we recorded it and it reached 93 decibels at its loudest, which is very impressive. 'Though she's surprisingly loud she's a lovely cat and we'd hate for it to stop her being rehomed.' Bluey went to the centre after her elderly owner had to go into care, and staff were shocked when they stroked her and she started growling like a dog. Measurement: The loud cat has been clocked at more than 90 decibels using a sound meter app . Homeless: Bluey is looking for a new owner and is currently living at a centre in Cambridge . Her purr, which is almost four time louder than the average cat, has been keeping other animals awake at night. Mis Thomas added: 'Bluey purrs all the time. She just has to see someone and she starts purring. She purrs when she's playing and she purrs when she's eating. 'We think Bluey is a little deaf but that doesn't stop her enjoying life. She's such a happy, friendly cat and she will make such a loving companion.' The noisy cat is well above the official world record holder Smokey, who was recorded at 67.7 decibels in March 2011, but her purr has not yet been officially certified. Contender: Bluey must now register with Guinness if she is to win the official world record . A spokesman for Guinness World Records said: 'We're intrigued by Bluey's talent and we would welcome an application from his owners so we can look into their claim. 'We would love to hear from them and strongly suggest they make an application for this record via our website.' However, Bluey's new owner may have to take precautions, as scientists say noise levels over 90 decibels can cause hearing loss over a prolonged period.

"Arsene Wenger wants Cesc Fabregas to be shown the ‘respect he deserves’ when he returns to the Emirates Stadium in the blue of Chelsea on Sunday. The problem with that is a decent chunk of Arsenal’s supporters feel he doesn’t deserve much. That became obvious on Thursday, when one prominent fan called for the removal of a Fabregas banner from the Ken Friar Bridge. Cesc Fabregas returns to Arsenal on Sunday and Arsene Wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception . Wenger wants 'respect' for the club's former players and counts Fabregas as a man who deserves that . Gunners fans offer their good luck to Fabregas in 2011, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time . Extreme, perhaps, but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where Fabregas built his career, not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from Barcelona to Chelsea are still as clear as mud. Any clarity, it seems, will have to wait. Wenger was at his cryptic best on Thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re-sign the player, saying: ‘We will have to discuss that one day. With all the terms.’ When pressed on whether it was his decision, he added: ‘It’s not as clean as that. I cannot speak to you about that now because that will not help us to win on Sunday.’ At that point it was suggested to Wenger that Fabregas chose not to come back and Wenger said: ‘I don’t know, I don’t know.’ The Frenchman has previously claimed that by the time he knew Fabregas was available, a deal with Chelsea was virtually concluded — comments which jarred a little with the Spaniard’s statement last summer that Arsenal ‘decided not to take’ their option. Whatever, it would be ambitious for Fabregas to expect an overwhelmingly positive reception on Sunday. The midfielder set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Certainly, there was already a degree of disappointment within the club about how their relationship with the player ended when he left in 2011. But Wenger said: ‘I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday, (I want him) to be respected like he deserves.’ Wenger added: ‘The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc’s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here.’ When he returns, it will be as a key part of the champions-elect and under a manager in Jose Mourinho who has won seven and drawn five of his 12 meetings with Wenger. That clash, in itself, is a fascinating sub-plot to this fixture between the top and second-placed teams in the Barclays Premier League. Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 .

"Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has defended the company's ridiculed 'Race Together' campaign as 'very genuine'. The campaign is encouraging workers to write 'Race Together' on cups and strike up conversations about race as they serve customers their coffee. The company is also preparing a guide with questions to pose, such as: 'How have your racial views evolved from those of your parents?' After the campaign was announced earlier this week, the coffee chain was slammed on social media and was accused of using racial tensions to boost its bottom line. But during Starbucks' annual shareholders meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, Schultz defended the campaign and said the company is simply trying to use its massive reach for good. Defense: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told Good Morning America, pictured, that he is simply trying to use the company's reach for good with its new 'Race Together' campaign . 'Some in the media will criticize Starbucks for having a political agenda,' he said. 'Our intentions are pure.' Speaking on CBS This Morning on Thursday, he added: 'This is a highly charged, highly emotional issue, we understand that. 'We've tried to be very thoughtful, very genuine, very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores, potentially, we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference.' He said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company's workers can 'elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day', he will be satisfied. After the campaign was announced, Twitter ruthlessly mocked Starbucks. One user tweeted: 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train.' Standing firm: He also addressed the massive social media backlash during the company's annual shareholder's meeting in Seattle on Wednesday (pictured), saying: 'Our intentions are pure' Support: Schultz was joined on stage at the annual meeting by rapper Common, who also spoke about the importance of engaging with people from different backgrounds in support of the campaign . Controversial: The new campaign encourages workers to write 'Race Together' on customer's cups and to strike up conversations about race. Pictured, customer Matt Ullman shows off one of the new stickers . Another added: '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life ""white man's burden"" crisis.' An executive on Starbucks' communications team, Corey duBrowa, even blocked people on Twitter before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign. DuBrowa later said in a post on Medium that he felt he was being 'personally attacked in a cascade of negativity' and that he had gotten overwhelmed, but later reactivated the account. When Good Morning America asked Schultz about some of the scathing criticism on Thursday, Schultz responded: 'Well, you know what I say to that - no good deed goes unpunished.' He has explained that workers do not have to participate in the campaign, and that stores can make customers another drink or cover up cups if they don't like the message. Ridiculed: After the campaign was

"After two drama-filled defeats in a week to local rivals Aston Villa, victory over Stoke, the club he managed for seven years before they judged his work there to be done, was a welcome tonic for Tony Pulis. A fourth consecutive clean sheet at home and a first-half goal from Brown Ideye takes West Bromwich Albion to 13th and 11 points from the drop zone. When Pulis, the engineer of Crystal Palace’s great escape last season, took over in January they hovered just one point above the bottom three, offering little to inspire optimism among their fans. Now their place in the top tier looks secure. Stoke were aiming at a fourth win in a row for the first time since 2011 but Pulis halted their progress. He said: ‘It doesn’t mean any more to win over Stoke, I had a wonderful journey there and left them in a sound financial and good position and did wonderful things. Today was about West Brom getting the points.’ Brown Ideye scores the opening goal during the match between West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City . Ideye's opener was the only goal of the game as West Bromwich Albion beat Stoke at the Hawthorns . Pulis praised the contribution made by Darren Fletcher, who arrived at The Hawthorns on a free transfer on January deadline day after a lengthy struggle with ulcerative colitis in his later years at Manchester United. ‘He’s been a fantastic signing,’ said Pulis. ‘A tremendous lad. His enthusiasm and energy levels are brilliant. I don’t know what illness it was but he looks as sprightly as any 20-year-old. I thought he and James Morrison [who partners Fletcher for Scotland] dominated the midfield.’ There were a few controversial moments, such as referee Michael Oliver’s decision to wave away what seemed a blatant penalty for Geoff Cameron’s hefty second-half challenge on Craig Dawson in the box. Oliver, who was praised for his officiating of Manchester United’s FA Cup defeat by Arsenal on Monday, is likely to get attention for different reasons after waving away penalty appeals, to Pulis’s obvious fury. ‘Michael will look at that again and be very disappointed, that’s a blatant a penalty as I’ve seen in a long time,’ he said. A beautiful cross into the box from Craig Gardner led to the goal in the 19th minute. It was expertly headed in at the far post by a stooping Ideye, who found it far too easy to escape the attentions of Phil Bardsley. Stoke had few chances and manager Mark Hughes lamented: ‘It was just one of those days when we had too many underperforming.’ Ideye celebrates as his first half goal earns the Baggies their fourth successive home win .

"Families crossing the Channel by Eurotunnel or ferry face Easter misery after ministers insisted on introducing new exit checks during one of the busiest getaways of the year. Queues of up to five miles and lengthy delays are predicted when the new regime starts on April 8. Under the new rules, the passport of every passenger in a car or coach will have to be individually scanned. Ministers insist that knowing who is leaving the country is vital for counting the number of immigrants in Britain and fighting crime and terrorism. Nightmare journeys: P&O Ferries has claimed new border control rules will cause huge delays leaving the country with 'coachloads of little old ladies bearing the brunt' But even though no checks have taken place over the past 17 years, the Home Office decided the best date to reinstate them should be on the second week in April – when vast numbers of Britons head to the continent during the Easter school break. Ferry companies warn that holidaymakers will be held in queues on the A20 in Kent, blocking the route between Dover and Folkestone during one of the busiest times of year. MPs on the home affairs select committee were sent a letter from the UK Chamber of Shipping claiming trials had shown that queues of at least 650 vehicles would form on busy days. Tim Reardon, the chamber’s policy director, said: ‘The model showed that, with tourist and freight check-in transactions extended by exit checks, the queue of traffic heading for the port of Dover would extend at least 8km, blocking the A20 almost as far as Folkestone.’ Eurotunnel calculates the new system will quadruple the time taken to get vehicles onto shuttle trains. Buses with 30 or more passengers on board will take even longer. Checking a car on to a cross-Channel train takes 15 seconds at the moment. But passport checks on up to five passengers will stretch that closer to two minutes, adding to delays. Eurotunnel public affairs director John Keefe said: ‘You only have to multiply the number of people in each vehicle – five six or seven in a car or 30 or more in a coach – to see how this will play out. Protective measures: The checks start on April 8 and Eurotunnel and ferry companies will be checking the passports of all those leaving the country to tighten national security . ‘That increases the risk of congestion and delays. That’s the risk we are trying to mitigate. But the risks are significant.’ Advice: Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told the Today programme that people should set out on their journeys earlier to avoid delays . Ministers were last night under pressure from MPs to make exceptions to the rules, such as large coach parties. Interviewed on BBC Radio Four’s Today programme yesterday, immigration minister James Brokenshire twice hesitated before saying passengers should set out early on their journeys. Quizzed a third time, he said: ‘On busy days I think it is advisable for anyone to set out earlier to ensure that they are

"(CNN)A sexual harassment complaint has been filed against New Zealand Prime Minister John Key after a waitress complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail at an Auckland cafe. CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that the complaint was filed Thursday morning by Graham McCready, an accountant described in the New Zealand press as a ""serial litigant,"" who has previously launched private prosecutions against Key. McCready's complaint claimed that Key had breached a section of the country's Human Rights Act relating to sexual harassment, TVNZ reported. It reported that he was seeking considerable compensation for the waitress, 26-year-old Amanda Bailey, and ""if she does not want it I ask for the money be given to Women's Refuge."" Key publicly apologized to Bailey, a waitress at his local cafe, for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail, after she complained about his behavior in a blog post. The post, published on New Zealand political website The Daily Blog, says that the odd behavior began during last year's election season. It was ""hardly an acceptable form of greeting,"" Bailey wrote. She wrote that while she didn't directly make her objections clear verbally, her body language ""screamed 'I don't like that.'"" ""As he approached me, he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary, suspense sound effects, like the music from the movie 'Jaws',"" read the post. ""As he towered overhead I slunk down, cringing, whilst (Key's wife) Bronagh told him to 'Leave the poor girl alone.'"" The behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions, the post states. Eventually the cafe's manager made it clear to Key that his actions were unwelcome. Key, who regularly visits the Auckland cafe with his wife, told reporters that his behavior was in the context of ""a bit of banter,"" but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense. The blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own JK 2012 Pinot Noir wine by way of apology. ""We have lots of fun and games there, there's always lots of practical jokes and things. It's a very warm and friendly relationship,"" he told reporters in Los Angeles en route to ANZAC day commemorations in Gallipoli, Turkey. ""But if you look at it now, no. When I realized she took offense by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologized and said I was terribly sorry."" Politicians and public figures also rounded on Key, with Green MP Metiria Turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate. ""A lot of New Zealanders know what it's like to feel as if you're not taken seriously in a job. As politicians, our job is to make people feel safe at work, not bullied,"" New Zealand media reported her as saying. ""It's a sign of how out of touch John Key has become when he can't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is, and when people are not

Speaking on Sky Sports' The Fantasy Football Club, Redknapp said: 'I went to Arsenal and to be honest with you they were fantastic. 'The people you meet, everyone, I signed autographs and spoke with everybody. I come out and had a couple of pictures in my car with the lads who come over - they were Arsenal fans.

"New Delhi, India (CNN)Police have arrested four employees of a popular Indian ethnic-wear chain after a minister spotted a security camera overlooking the changing room of one of its stores. Federal education minister Smriti Irani was visiting a FabIndia outlet in the tourist resort state of Goa on Friday when she discovered a surveillance camera pointed at the changing room, police said. Four employees of the store have been arrested, but its manager -- herself a woman -- was still at large Saturday, said Goa police superintendent Kartik Kashyap. State authorities launched their investigation right after Irani levied her accusation. They found an overhead camera that the minister had spotted and determined that it was indeed able to take photos of customers using the store's changing room, according to Kashyap. After the incident, authorities sealed off the store and summoned six top officials from FabIndia, he said. The arrested staff have been charged with voyeurism and breach of privacy, according to the police. If convicted, they could spend up to three years in jail, Kashyap said. Officials from FabIndia -- which sells ethnic garments, fabrics and other products -- are heading to Goa to work with investigators, according to the company. ""FabIndia is deeply concerned and shocked at this allegation,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are in the process of investigating this internally and will be cooperating fully with the police.""

"Human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time, according to scientists. Researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in China that has introduced DNA changes to reproductive cells. Although the scientific paper is yet to be published, the scientific world is abuzz with rumours that the work has been carried out. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren. Human embryos, like the one above, may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques . They say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications. They have described it as 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable'. However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. A gene editing technique known as CRISPR can search through DNA and replace specific genes or remove them. Under proposals put forward by Dr Luhan Yang, human ovarian tissue from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer could be used to obtain immature egg cells. These could then be encouraged to grow in the laboratory before using CRISPR to remove the genetic fault causing the cancer. The defective BRAC1 gene, for example, results in inherited breast and ovarian cancer. By repairing this gene, the resulting egg could be made healthy. Researchers at the moment say this should only be used for scientific research but it opens up the possibility of using edited eggs to create human embryos that have had heritable diseases removed. According to a report by the National Post, Professor George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, says a paper outlining the technology is due to be published. He said: 'There is a paper from China. I don't think it's been accepted yet, but I think it will be at some point.' His comments match those made by several leading scientists working with non-reproductive stem cells who have raised concerns over the new technology. Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases. Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations. Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China. A number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos. Germ line genetic editing alters the DNA in sperm and egg cells - meaning the changes can be passed on . Xingxu Huang, from Shanghai Tech University in China has been seeking permission to perform the technique on

"Three children from a remote mountain village in China travel on horseback for three hours a day in order to attend their nearest school. The eight-year-olds endure the 16km round trip every day accompanied by their elderly grandparents - who walk for six hours a day to ensure their grandchildren get the education they themselves were denied. The grandparents of Huang Shijun, Huang Chenbin and Huang Lingyan take the children from their remote home in Mudong village to school every day on horseback, leading the animals along the muddy, rocky and winding track 1,300m above sea level. The grandparents take it in turns to lead the horses along the trail, which is 1,300 metres above sea level . The journey can be dangerous, particularly when it is icy - then the children have to stay at home . The children, all from the Yao ethnic minority group, are all 'left-behind children' - which means their parents have left them in the care of their grandparents while they look for work in towns and cities miles from their village homes. The People's Daily Online reports the youngsters have ridden the horses along the muddy and often dangerous road to school for the last three years. All three youngsters are in Grade One at Liuli elementary school. Huang Shijun, Huang Chenbin and Huang Lingyan are all aged just eight - and travel 16km a day to school . Huang Lingyan (left) said she loves going to school by horse - and all her friends are jealous of her transport . The muddy road from Mudong to Liuli village was only built in 2010, supported by government grants and cannot carry cars. The school has just one teacher, who has worked there alone for five years, teaching two classes with 19 students in total. Huang Fengjun, Huang Chenbin's 60-year-old grandfather, has been using a horse to carry his grandson to school since Huang Chenbin started preschool three years ago. He said the three families had three horses and use them to carry their children to school. During busy seasons for farmers one elderly person takes all three children to school on behalf of the three families. The children often get soaked through on their daily excursions as they cannot carry umbrellas when it rains . After arriving at school, the horses are tied in front of the school's field to graze and the elderly people return to their village. At 3pm the grandparents walk back to the school to take the children home. According to Huang Fengjun, their horses are very docile and do not run around or kick people. But at the beginning of March one horse ran into the mountains and disappeared. Now the three children have to share two horses to get to school. The children often get soaked through on their daily excursions as they cannot carry umbrellas when it rains. Huang Fengjun said: 'Rain will wet their clothes and shoes, so we use plastic sheets to cover the kids and then take them slowly on the horses to school.' But

"Deceased: Jason Kortz has been identified as the Navy SEAL who fell to his death during a training exercise in Southern California . Navy officials say a SEAL killed when his parachute malfunctioned during training in Southern California was a 29-year-old Colorado man who completed basic training to become a SEAL last year. Naval Special Warfare Group One said Thursday that Jason Kortz of Highlands Ranch, Colorado, died from injuries sustained during the accident in Perris on Wednesday. The Navy is investigating why the parachute malfunctioned. It released no further details. Naval Special Warfare Group One is the Coronado-based SEALs group to which the sailor was assigned. Kortz enlisted in the Navy in 2012 and completed basic training for the SEALs last year in Coronado. He is survived by his wife, parents and brother. KABC-TV captured an aerial shot of the commando's body on the ground covered by an American flag with first responders gathered around. Paramedics apparently received a report around 9am on Wednesday that there was a 'skydiver down' at a grassy location outside of Perris in Riverside County. The sailor died of injuries sustained in the daytime parachute jump but no other details were immediately available. Kortz was identified by officials as a West Coast-based member of the Naval Special Warfare Group ONE. All Navy SEALS are required to take parachute jump course during their qualification training. Fateful accident: A navy SEAL has died after his parachute malfunctioned during a skydiving training exercise in Southern California . Scene of the incident: Paramedics apparently received a report around 9am on Wednesday that there was a 'skydiver down' at a grassy location outside of Perris in Riverside County . During missions they are often air-dropped into extremely difficult-to-reach places meaning they must know how to navigate different heights and terrains. Indeed, the SEAL name is short for sea, air and land. Perris is a popular area for skydivers with one of the largest skydiving centers in the world, Skydive Perris. The facility declined to comment on Wednesday's skydiving fatality. This was at least the 20th death reported at the Perris facility since 2000. The last death occurred last November, when Justin Gulley, 36, of Canyon Lake was involved in a landing accident.

"A 15-year-old who wanted to join Islamic State as a jihadi bride has been revealed to be the fifth girl from Bethnal Green Academy trying to join the extremist group. The teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was stopped from joining the Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria by police on the runway at Heathrow after her plane was grounded. The girl went to the same east London school as Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, who fled to join IS fighters last month, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Scroll down for video . The girl went to the same school, Bethnal Green Academy, as Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, who fled to join IS fighters last month . The trio (pictured) followed their friend Sharmeena Begum who first went to the Middle East to join IS. All of the girls knew each other well . She boarded a British Airways flight to Istanbul on December 6, without the knowledge of her parents, months before her schoolmates made their successful attempt. Her plane was held as it taxied for take-off and was turned around at the last minute. All four of the aspiring jihadists followed their friend Sharmeena Begum who first went to the Middle East to join IS. All of the girls knew each other well. The unknown Bethnal Green Academy pupil was one of five others from the school to be given travel bans to stop them from going to Syria this week. The court orders showed a total of eight students from the same Academy in Tower Hamlets had showed an interest in Islamic fanaticism. A judge banned five girls – three of whom are 16 and two 15 – from travelling abroad after they showed an interest in going to Syria. The court orders showed a total of eight students from the same Academy in Tower Hamlets had showed an interest in Islamic fanaticism . He ordered their passports to be taken off them and for them to be made wards of the court. Despite repeated claims by the families of the teenaged girls now in Syria that they had no idea of their children’s plans, it emerged, also this week, that the father of Amira Abase held extremist views. In 2012 Abase Hussen marched on the US embassy with hate preacher Anjem Choudary and one of the murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. In 2012 Abase Hussen (pictured) marched on the US embassy with hate preacher Anjem Choudary and one of the murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby . He was pictured burning an American flag but had spoken emotionally of his daughter’s disappearance, issuing aplea for her safe return. Later, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen, denied even knowing what Islamic radicalisation was. Last month he gave evidence to Parliament, refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls’ actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others.

"Real Madrid are hoping that a win against Levante on Sunday night will help them make peace with their fans, who have turned on the team after a recent poor run of form. Carlo Ancelotti's men have come under fierce criticism after squandering their lead at the top of La Liga, with Marca's front page on Sunday referring to the situation as a 'pressure cooker'. Levante are the visitors to the Bernabeu, in what AS have described as a 'trial run' for next week's El Clasico. The match at the Nou Camp on March 22 will go a long way to deciding this season's La Liga champions, and Ancelotti will be desperate to reclaim Madrid's spot at the top of the table. The front page of Marca leads with the headline, 'Pressure Cooker' ahead of Real Madrid's game on Sunday . Madrid face Levante at the Bernabeu on Sunday night, while Barcelona beat Eibar 2-0 on Saturday . There will be changes in the starting line-up for the Levante clash, the Spanish papers claim, with Keylor Navas expected to get the nod ahead of Iker Casillas. The Spanish veteran made a number of high-profile mistakes against Schalke in the Champions League last week. Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric are also expected to start, in order to get themselves ready for El Clasico. Marca carry a quote from Madrid boss Ancelotti, who has stated that his team are 'hurt, but won't let our heads drop'. Barcelona continued their good form on Saturday, comfortably beating Eibar 2-0. The win means that they have extended their lead at the top to four points - and it is up to Madrid to close the gap with victory on Sunday. In Italy, Juventus won 1-0 against Palermo, and are now gearing up for their Champions League game midweek . Morata scored the winning goal, and Tuttosport's headline (left) reads: 'Borussia, we're coming' Mundo Deportivo's front page hails the 'solid leaders', who came through the game ahead of a decisive week against Manchester City and then Real Madrid. They write that Lionel Messi was once again decisive, scoring both of his side's goals, one from the penalty spot and the other a 'great header'. Messi has taken his tally to 32 league goals for the season, overtaking rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the process. In Italy, much of the focus is on Juventus ahead of their Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund. Massimiliano Allegri's side beat Palermo 1-0 to 'send a message to Borussia', who they beat 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 game a fortnight ago. Elsewhere, Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini has labelled Yaya Toure his 'son', noting: 'With him, what an Inter!' There has been much speculation over the Ivorian's future at Manchester City, and Mancini has been honest in admitting his interest in the midfielder.

"A former Portuguese detective was today ordered to pay nearly £360,000 to Kate and Gerry McCann after a long-running libel trial. Goncalo Amaral had been on trial over claims he made in a book and a documentary that the couple were involved in their daughter Madeleine's disappearance. In a written verdict, a Lisbon court agreed that Amaral should pay Mr and Mrs McCann €250,000 (£179,000) each in damages and banned further sales of his book The Truth Of The Lie. The couple's lawyer Isabel Duarte also revealed that Amaral had been told to pay interest which she said stood at present at €106,000 (£76,000). Scroll down for video . Kate and Gerry McCann have reportedly been awarded £360,000 in damages from an ex-Portuguese detective who wrote a book claiming their daughter Madeleine had died in an accident instead of being abducted . Police chief Goncalo Amaral (above) ran the initial investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann . Madeleine was three when she went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Mr Amaral, who led the initial investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, released his book three days after the case was closed in 2008. He later took part in a documentary for Portuguese television in which he claimed that Madeleine was dead, that there had been no abduction and the McCanns had hidden her body. The couple, who accuse Amaral of hampering the search for their daughter, had been expected to receive around £1million in damages. Amaral's lawyers have leave to appeal the ruling. The McCanns told the court last summer they were left 'devastated and crushed' by his book, which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief. Mrs McCann, 47, said Madeleine's twin siblings Sean and Amelie, now ten, knew Mr Amaral had written a book but didn't know the detail. Amaral claimed Madeleine (above) had not been abducted, but had died in an accident in Praia da Luz . She told the court last July after applying to make a statement: 'I believe that's what's in Mr Amaral's book and the documentary is very distressing to adults. 'To a child, it could be very damaging.' Asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book, she said: 'I was devastated. 'It made me feel quite desperate because of the injustice I felt towards my daughter and our family as a whole. 'It was very painful to read and I felt sad for Madeleine. I also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage I felt it was doing in Portugal.' She went on to accuse Amaral, thrown off the investigation in 2007 for criticising British police, of 'consistently smearing' them. She also claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter's whereabouts. A team of 31 British detectives are working exclusively to find the girl. Mystery: British police shift through soil on an

"They’re the kind of colourful adverts that would have been created by the real-life Don Drapers, Peggy Olsons and other ‘mad men’ of Madison Avenue. These vintage posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience, passengers wore their best clothes and there was plenty of legroom. They’re featured in a new coffee table book, Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975, which revisits a time when the skies were dominated by the likes of Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp (BOAC) and Continental. Scroll down for video . Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was a dominant and influential airline which declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1991 . Many of the adverts in the book featured beautiful women in an effort to glamorise destinations and encourage people to travel . British Airways promoted its launch of the Concorde in the 1970s (left) while Trans World Airlines (TWA) promoted its New York route . Authored by Matthias C Huhne, the 436-page book contains dozens of glamorous adverts that encouraged those who could afford to fly to visit far-flung destinations such as Haiti, Hawaii, Japan, New York and London. The simple but effective posters showcase each destination with eye-catching cartoons or photos of beautiful women, landmarks such as Times Square and Tower of London, and natural beauty spots including Bermuda’s picturesque coastline and Sydney Harbour. New York was one of the most popular destinations featured in the adverts in Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 . The adverts were created for the biggest airlines of the day, including TWA and Canadian Pacific, which no longer exist . British Overseas Airways Corp led to the creation of British Airways (left) while Continental merged with United Airlines' parent company . It was a time when it cost an incredible amount of money to purchase a ticket for a commercial flight, with many of the ads promoting transatlantic or transpacific travel. The adverts created for the biggest airlines of the day, including many which no longer exist, offer a glimpse at how air travel, advertising and society changed over the 30-year period covered in the book. From a psychedelic image of a surfer in Hawaii to British Airways' introduction of the Concorde, the posters reflect the eras in which they were created by some of the best creative minds of the time, including Ivan Chermayeff, Otl Aicher, Massimo Vignelli and Saul Bass, Academy Award-winning filmmaker. The posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience and passengers dressed smart .

"An eagle demonstrated its footwork after gate-crashing a football team’s training session and enjoying a solo kick-about. Filmed in North Vancouver, the bird - which appears to be a golden eagle, despite some speculation that it is a young bald - is captured standing over a football during its try-out before giving it a slight peck with its beak. After standing and shaking its head, the big bird then moves forwards and rolls the ball to the left with its foot. The bird interrupts the training session by approaching a football and giving it a peck before enjoying a kick-about . Excited by the movement, it runs after it and rolls the ball to the right before jumping up on it with both feet. As the ball rolls away the members of the North Shore Football Club, whose training session had been interrupted by the eagle, can be heard laughing. The bird then runs back over to the football and a youngster can be heard saying: ‘The eagle has landed.’ The eagle gets excited and after rolling the ball, jumps up onto it with both feet and causes it to move . Rolling the ball back a few more times, the bird once again jumps onto it before stopping to give it another peck. Upping the quality, the eagle rolls the ball to the left once more but this time keeps its foot on top of it so that it is controlled underneath. It then successfully jumps up onto the ball with two feet and balances for a moment before its momentum causes the ball to roll away - as if it had given it a kick. The eagle successfully attempts to roll the football with both feet on a number of occasions . The ball is then passed back to the bird by the video maker, but the eagle seems to have lost interest and lets the ball roll by. Before turning and running over towards it with an unmeasured amount of excitement. The video concludes with what must be the team’s coach saying: ‘Okay guys let’s get back in the grid, let’s go.’ The majestic bird finishes its kick-about and sits beside the ball before deciding to fly away . And the bird, who sits majestically next to the football for a moment, flying away. According to National Post Canada, the boys from the North Shore Football team, delighted by the eagle, were from Sutherland secondary school in Vancouver.

"Brendan Rodgers took radical steps to transform Liverpool’s season as he feared a failure to do so would leave him in danger of being sacked. Liverpool’s fortunes have transformed since Rodgers drastically switched his side’s system to an attack-minded 3-4-3 formation in December; they are the form team in the Barclays Premier League, having taken 27 points from the last 33. The memory of how bad things were in November, though, has not left Rodgers and he has admitted that his experience at Reading, when he was axed in December 2009 after just 20 matches in charge, triggered his decision to rip things up and start again. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers speaks to his coaches during a training session at Melwood . The former Swansea City manager shares a joke with Ivorian defender Kolo Toure in training . Rodgers chats to England full back Glen Johnson during the training session at Melwood . Rodgers is highly-regarded by Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners, and he signed a new long-term contract last May but the 42-year-old knows none of that would have mattered had his side’s results continued on a downward spiral. ‘I certainly wasn’t going to roll over and die,’ said Rodgers, whose side face Burnley On Wednesday. ‘I love it here and I want to be successful. But after the Crystal Palace game (in November when Liverpool lost 3-1) in particular, I felt ""it doesn’t matter how much support you have, the team is not functioning"". ‘It could not go on, really. My experience at Reading told me that. That’s what I learned from that sacking. I went in with the full backing of the chairman, who was great to me. Even though it was a three-year project and they wanted me there, I got the sack after 20 games. ‘I learnt that it does not matter how much support you have in the boardroom, you have to get results – and you have to win. So I needed to make sure that I was going to make decisions which would allow us to get back to at least somewhere near where we were. Liverpool beat Premier League champions Manchester City 2-1 in their last league outing . Midfielders Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho both scored brilliant goals during the win .

Brendan Rodgers took radical steps to transform Liverpool’s season as he feared a failure to do so would leave him in danger of being sacked . Liverpool’s fortunes have transformed since Rodgers drastically switched his side’s system to an attack-minded 3-4-3 formation in December; they are the form team in the Barclays Premier League, having taken 27 points from the last 33 . The memory of how bad things were in November, though, has not left Rodgers and he has admitted that his experience at Reading, when he was axed in December 2009 after just 20 matches in charge, triggered his decision to rip"
"Journalist and author of the best-selling book I Quit Sugar has opened up about her own personal battle with mental illness, revealing she came close to taking her own life.

Sarah Wilson opened up in a candid interview about how her battle with mental illness drove her to believe her life wasn't worth living . During the intimate interview Ms Wilson revealed it was a combination of issues, including mounting stress, anxiety, her thyroid disease and distant family, that drove her to believe her life was no longer worth living. She said 'people get on with their lives' and while she hadn't found a husband, nor had children, she felt increasingly isolated. 'I was essentially very alone,' Ms Wilson added. 'My anxiety brought me to a point where I couldn't quite see the existential point of continuing' 'I couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel,' she added. Ms Wilson said while she struggled through her younger years she has recently 'found some peace with it.' In Ms Wilson's eyes, depression and anxiety are intrinsically linked. She thinks we need to acknowledge this link to be better equipped to tackle the increasing rate of Australian women who are being negatively affected by stress and anxiety. Ms Wilson said while she now accepts she is an 'anxious person', when she was younger she watched everybody else coping and felt like she had 'missed out on a guide book to life' Ms Wilson said while she now accepts she is an 'anxious person', when she was younger she watched everybody else coping and felt like she had 'missed out on a guide book to life'. Ms Wilson said anxiety is quickly becoming the 'new depression'.

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is under no illusions about the potential repercussions of Monday night’s visit to Old Trafford. Any clash against Manchester United, particularly in the Wenger era, carries added value for the Gunners. The fact that it is an FA Cup quarter-final with a place at Wembley at stake merely adds to the occasion. And for Wenger it’s a chance to land what could be a crucial psychological blow on Louis van Gaal’s side ahead of the tense season finale. Theo Walcott holds off Nacho Monreal as Arsenal trained on Sunday at their London Colney training ground . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain lets fly with a shot, as Arsene Wenger promised his team would attack United . The Gunners squad are put through their paces as they look to reach Wembley for the third time in two years . Arsene Wenger is confident his team can beat Manchester United by playing attacking football . The FA Cup isn’t the only competition in which these two giants are going toe to toe. They are also battling for a Champions League position, a race which is perhaps more pertinent to both clubs’ long-term ambitions. There are no points at stake tonight but Wenger said: ‘It’s a big game, and every big win in a big game has an impact subconsciously in the belief of the team.’ However, the reverse is also true. Losing against United could plant a seed of doubt in Arsenal’s quest to finish in the top four — and their poor recent record at Old Trafford doesn’t bode well. United have won nine out of their last 10 home games against the Gunners. We shouldn’t forget, though, that Wenger also has pleasant memories of the Theatre of Dreams. He lists Sylvain Wiltord’s goal that clinched the title for Arsenal at Old Trafford in 2002 as his favourite. And the Frenchman insists his current crop of players can produce another win in United’s back yard on Monday night. Arsenal's World Cup winning playmaker Mesut Ozil has been in top form since returning from injury . Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez, who scored a brilliant goal in midweek against QPR, looks lively in training . Per Mertesacker, whose place was in doubt before an injury to Gabriel, gestures to his team-mates . ‘I don’t believe our recent record at Old Trafford (to be a factor). When the team is less good, they lose. When the team is not as good, they lose,’ said Wenger. ‘It doesn’t matter what shirt they wear, or what stadium they play in. It is down to quality. ‘If I’ve learnt something in my life it’s that the performance on the day decides the outcome of the day, not where you play. ‘The fact that we can win away from home, that is important. If you haven’t won away from home all season it’s more difficult. But we know we can do well away from home.’ Tomas Rosicky attempts to control the ball as Walcott, Mertesacker and Ramsey watch on .

"Dame Jane Goodall has condemned politicians for pushing 'Frankenstein Food' Dame Jane Goodall, the renowned primate expert, has condemned ‘deluded’ politicians for pushing ‘Frankenstein Food’. The highly respected academic has endorsed a new book, which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers. Historically, critics of GM food have been lambasted by the GM companies, scientists who rely on their funding, and politicians, including the UK Government, as being ‘anti-science’. However, Dame Jane argues that the advocates of GM food have ignored evidence of harm with the result it is they who are guilty of being ‘anti-science’. The intervention is a powerful condemnation of the way biotech companies like Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer, have forced GM crops and food on to dinner plates in the US without proper safety tests. And she is joining a growing campaign warning that Britain and Europe must not drop safeguards that have kept GM crops out. Dame Jane’s concerns have been raised in the foreword to a new book, ‘Altered Genes, Twisted Truth’, which is written by the American public interest lawyer, Steve Druker. Its publication comes as the US is seeing a growing backlash against GM. Just last week it emerged that the country’s favourite chocolate manufacturer, Hershey, is to drop GM from its products. Dame Jane said she has become appalled as what she calls a ‘shocking corruption of the life forms of the planet’. She said the GM process, which involves adding foreign genes to plants to create toxins to fend off insects or give them immunity to being sprayed with chemical pesticides has fundamentally changed them. However, she complains that supporters of the technology have committed a ‘fraud’ by trying to give the false impression that these new plants are essentially the same as those created by conventional plant breeding. She said: ‘This very real difference between GM plants and their conventional counterparts is one of the basic truths that biotech proponents have endeavoured to obscure. As part of the process, they portrayed the various concerns as merely the ignorant opinions of misinformed individuals – and derided them as not only unscientific, but anti-science. ‘They then set to work to convince the public and government officials, through the dissemination of false information, that there was an overwhelming expert consensus, based on solid evidence, that the new foods were safe. Yet this, as Druker points out, was clearly not true.’ Importantly, she claims, the companies have spread disinformation to try and win public support. ‘Druker describes how amazingly successful the biotech lobby has been – and the extent to which the general public and government decision makers have been hoodwinked by the clever and methodical twisting of the facts and the propagation of many myths. Moreover, it appears that a number of respected scientific institutions, as well as many eminent scientists, were complicit in this relentless spreading of disinformation.’ Dame Jane is considered to be the world’s foremost expert on chimpanzees. She is best known for her 55-year study of social and

"Momentarily, he looked his age. Having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin, Jordan Spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green. History was assured. He wasn’t going to three-putt from there, so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the Masters. He wanted it to be more than that, though. The best it could be. The exuberance of youth was kicking in. Spieth missed. For the first time around Augusta, he made a mild mis-step. He wheeled away, hopped a little, almost coltish in his frustration. He marched back to his ball, prepared to tap it in. Except it wasn’t a real tap-in. There was a bit still to do. And at that point, Spieth checked. He stepped away. He marked his ball. He let Henrik Stenson play. He did the sensible thing. Spieth always does the sensible thing. That is part of his wonder. Jordan Spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14-under 130 . Spieth leads Charley Hoffman by five strokes, matching the largest halfway lead in Masters history . Some might think that makes him boring. It doesn’t make him boring. To shoot 14 under, the lowest two-round score at Augusta, and equal to the best 36-hole score recorded at a major championship, isn’t boring. We may be watching a sporting phenomenon. A performance as breathtaking as Tiger Woods’s arrival in 1997. There will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole. If Spieth repeats his achievement at the Hero World Challenge in Florida last year, perhaps, when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. Those numbers are unlikely though. As the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery, his scores are bound to fall. Against that, it will be a lot harder to chase Spieth’s total than just maintain it. Modern courses have, of course, been Tiger-proofed before — but in the short term Augusta may need to be Spieth-proofed, too, if his scoring stays stable. This was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. He has been in the top three players in five of those six, too. ‘I was a bit out of my comfort zone, at the moment on the 18th,’ Spieth confirmed. ‘I was going to have to work around Henrik’s line — and I just thought if I step away I am definitely going to make this putt, so that was the only way I could miss. ‘I have to work to control those things the next two days. If I can shoot 14 under then a lot of other players could shoot 14 under, so I have to be ready for that and to match their scores now. The stress levels can get pretty high. Still, it’s pretty cool any time you can lead the Masters and to

"Labour would overhaul school inspections in favour of a ‘light-touch’ system allowing teachers to assess each other, Tristram Hunt said . A Labour government would overhaul school inspections in favour of a ‘light-touch’ system allowing teachers to assess each other, the party’s education spokesman has said. Tristram Hunt said a new peer review system would free up teachers from an ‘avalanche of bureaucracy’ and increase confidence in the regulation process. The proposals, which would result in Ofsted taking a less hands-on approach, could be a reality by 2020 if Labour was elected, he said. Mr Hunt acknowledged that the regulator had been a vehicle for progress, but said it was beginning to ‘choke something far more precious’, and threaten the ‘joy’ of schooling. Speaking at the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Liverpool, he said: ‘We can begin the process of “mass devolution” where important powers over professional standards, quality assurance, curriculum development and peer review are handed over to profession-led bodies – and we will. ‘Ofsted needs to move towards a supportive, light-touch, profession-led, centrally moderated, peer review system of inspection. ‘I want this conference to hold me to account for moving towards it over the course of the next Parliament.’ The proposals would see teachers and head teachers helping to assess the performance of other schools. Scroll down for video . Ofsted would regulate this process, although the details of how the system would work have not been finalised. Mr Hunt said: ‘Let nobody tell you this is a soft touch. Let nobody tell you this is a threat to standards. Rather this is the embodiment of trust, collaboration and a 21st-century approach to rigour and under-performance.’ The proposals would see teachers and headteachers helping to assess the performance of other schools (file picture) He added: ‘I want to see an inspectorate that moves beyond box-ticking and data-dependence. ‘I want to see an inspectorate that allows heads with a strong track record the space to innovate and develop a richer criterion of school achievement.’ Priya Dutta, spokesman for the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘The system needs an overhaul, and in general we would welcome proposals for this. ‘But the problem with peer review is that it’s so open to abuse. ‘We would be sceptical about how impartial this peer review would be, so these things would need to be planned very carefully. ‘I’m slightly wary of Ofsted taking a step back because I think there needs to be an independent teaching review body. I wonder how effective peer review would be in practice.’

"Most of America has spent this winter shivering in a colder-than-usual polar plunge that's seen almost every state turned white and the Great Lakes freeze over. But in Alaska, residents are wondering what's become of the blizzards and arctic lows that usually characterize the northernmost state. The biggest city, Anchorage, is so unseasonably warm that a winter festival could only go ahead after trucks drove in snow from a stockpile, and hide it under PVC to stop it from melting away. No-show snow: Streets in Anchorage were snowless (left) for a winter festival, while volunteers (right) had to pile up snow and cover it with PVC so a sculpting competition could go ahed. The rest of the U.S. has had a frigid winter . We took your winter! This was the scene Saturday on Boston Common, the heart of a city buried in snow - prompting the envy of Alaskans . Digging out: Boston's motorists found their cars swamped by snow, while the usually frigid land of Alaska was left hardly touched . Want some of this? In the Massachusetts capital, huge piles of snow have emerged as authorities struggle to find anywhere to put snow taken off the roads . Bemused residents even took to asking Boston - which has been swamped with more than 100 inches of snow in a record-breaking winter - if they can have their winter back. Speaking to the Boston Globe, Anchorage-dweller Danielle Crelley, 19, said said: 'This is the worst winter ever... We can’t even go sledding. I just want to build a snowman.' Another, store owner Nina Walker, proposed a trade between Massachusetts and Alaska. She said: 'You give us your snow, and we’ll give you the Palins.' Cameras from local station KTUU showed the snow-less scenes in the city. Their comments follow an unusual set-up for the annual Fur Rendezvous festival, in which Anchorage city authorities had to spread a thin coating of snow from diminishing stockpile to create a winter feel. Sunday highs in the city are set to be above freezing, while Wednesday is predicted rain. A dog sledding race, which usually winds through the Anchorage streets, has been relocated 260 miles north, where there is still enough snow. It was the first time the event had to move since it began in 1946. Wanna trade? One Alaskan said that Boston was welcome to Sarah Palin and her family - if they can restore winter to Anchorage . Winter of two Americas: Climate figures showed that this winter has seen western states experience unseasonable warmth, while the east shivered. Alaska has been warmed by the same phenomenon heating California . Speaking to the KTVA station, former organizer Gary Huffard said: 'This weather is as crazy as it can get!'. He later encouraged people to come down to the event's funfair because, for once, 'you can enjoy the carnival without turning blue'. It comes as cold weather records continue to fall across the country, with February declared the coldest month in New York for 81 years. Boston was predicted still more snow

"Commonplace they may be, but there's nothing ordinary about camellias. Polished evergreen foliage provides a great contrast with brightly coloured flowers and brings life to dull winter gardens. And when the flowers open their '­alabaster petals' — as the novelist Balzac put it — camellias are positively regal. They are easy to grow, but picky about soil. If yours is acid, free-draining and nutritious, they'll thrive, but they mope in alkaline or neutral ground. So, if your soil doesn't suit, plant in containers in ericaceous compost. The polished evergreen foliage of Camellias makes for a great contrast to the brightly coloured flowers . Camellias are amazingly versatile. You can give them free rein or prune to keep them compact. I've seen them trained on walls, bent over arches and even grown as hedging. Tender kinds such as C. reticulata make outstanding conservatory plants. Camellias are happy in sun or shade and grow as readily among other shrubs as in isolation. Though frost will damage open flowers, the buds and plants of most are bone hardy. And unlike other spring shrubs, camellias stagger their flowering over a long time. PERFECT FOR POTS . Potted camellias won't last as long as those in the ground. They tend to lose their youthful charm after five or six years, but are not difficult to propagate. If you don't want to buy new, take root cuttings and bring them on as replacements. The best time to take cuttings is between September and February, but you can try it now. Select healthy young shoots for leaf bud cuttings. Snip out sections, each with a single leaf and a little bud by the leaf stalk. Sever each stem just above that bud and again an inch below the leaf. Put the cutting in a mix of potting compost and grit or Perlite and place in a cold frame or propagator. This is also a good time to buy camellia plants. You can see them in flower, select your favourites and enjoy this year's display. The choice is vast, with 250 wild species and hundreds more garden varieties. Camellia japonica — native to cooler regions of China, Japan and Korea — has given rise to the hardiest and prettiest. I grow sumptuous red semidouble Adolphe Audusson and single white Alba Simplex, which thrive in containers in our bracing Lincolnshire climate. The Williamsii hybrids are also gorgeous. Developed in the Twenties by J. C. Williams, the former owner of Caerhays Castle in Cornwall, they have a greatly extended flowering season. I grow the first-named of his progeny, St Ewe. If the weather is mild, the single pink flowers appear in midwinter and continue until April. PINK AND PERKY . You may not have heard of St Ewe, but you're likely to know Donation, Britain's most popular Camellia variety. The semi-double, subtly veined pink flowers have a translucent alabaster gleam and it never stints on flower numbers. If your soil is borderline acid, Williamsii camellias, such as Donation, seem to do best. Each spring, work sulphur powder into the ground round the

Mrs Cameron told reporters: 'He doesn't seem too nervous but I'm very glad it's him doing it and not me.'

The blonde star was seen looking decidedly modest as she emerged for the first time since ther provocative shoot for Marfa Journal went viral. WARNING: EXPLICIT CONTENT . Covered-up: Chloe Sevigny swapped strategically-placed lobsters for a more low-key approach to fashion when she stepped out in New York on Friday . Wearing a faux fur jacket with a pair of slim-cut, stonewash jeans, she cut something of a retro figure as she navigated the East Village. Capping her look with a black, leather bag and a matching pair of boots, she'd obviously been treating herself to a spot of retail therapy as she carried a shopping bag. Hiding behind a pair of designer sunglasses and sipping a take-away coffee, she looked almost incognito after causing such a stir. That 70s-inspred showgirl: Wearing a faux fur jacket with a pair of slim-cut, stonewash jeans, she cut something of a retro figure as she navigated the East Village . Just 24 hours earlier Chloe, whose hit film include The Last Days Of Disco with Kate Beckinsale, caused quite a scene on the cover of the Marfa Journal. Not least because the 40 year-old could be seen nearly naked and sprawled out over a retro kitchen work top - with a large marine crustacean between her legs. The image was just one of many bizarre visuals, from a nun in chain underwear to scantily-clad Red Riding Hood. Claws for draws: Choe Sevigny ditches her underwear for new Marfa Journal pictures as she poses with a lobster over her crotch . The four fake billboards divide the whole magazine into four sections: raw, decadent, romantic and progressive. And they're sure to continue to get attention, though loyal fans' interest in the content may be waning as the shoot sees the Swedish actress in a whole new light. Golden Globe winning and Academy Award nominated Chloe has previously enjoyed roles in Boys Don't Cry and American Psycho but these latest roles appear to put her in an all new-genre.

"Jonny Howson's double inspired Norwich as they maintained their promotion charge in style with a ruthless 4-1 triumph over relegation threatened Millwall at The Den. The hosts spurned numerous chances in a tense first half before Howson surged from midfield to fire a sublime left-footed strike beyond keeper David Forde. Gary Hooper doubled Norwich's lead with a penalty just before the break after Cameron Jerome was felled by Alan Dunne, before Wes Hoolahan made it three and Howson scored his second on the hour. Jonathan Howson scores the first goal of the game during the Championship match at The Den . Howson celebrates his opener with Norwich City teammate Bradley Johnson as the Canaries smash Millwall . It's all too easy for the away side as they deal Millwall manager Ian Holloway yet another striking blow . A stunned Millwall found enough resilience to claim a goal back after Diego Fabbrini won a penalty that Lee Gregory converted but it was too little too late to ease the pressure on beleaguered manager Ian Holloway. After sustained Norwich pressure for the first 20 minutes, Millwall began to respond, as Jos Hooiveld saw his powerful volley blocked by Carlos Cuellar before Ricardo Fuller struck team-mate Martyn Woolford with another effort. The lively Fuller continued to threaten as first Cuellar and then Martin Olsson clumsily fouled the striker on the edge of the area, but the hosts squandered both opportunities from either side of the box. Gary Hooper celebrates his goal from the penalty spot as Norwich all but seal the points at The Den . Norwich City's Wesley Hoolahan celebrates scoring their third goal in the win against Millwall on Saturday . The hosts' wastefulness was duly punished in the 38th minute when Howson surged through midfield and struck an exquisite drive beyond Forde from outside the area to give Norwich the lead. While Howson's goal was slightly harsh on Millwall, the hosts had themselves to blame for Norwich's second on the stroke of half time. Graham Dorrans' long-range effort was saved well by Forde, only for Alan Dunne to needlessly fell Jerome as the striker went to retrieve the rebound, with Hooper firing the resulting penalty straight down the middle. Millwall manager Holloway looks on as his Lions are tamed by the Canaries at The Den on Saturday . Norwich City manager Alex Neil gives his squad the thumbs up as they comfortably see off Millwall .

Norwich had barely broken sweat in establishing a two-goal advantage and had a chance to make it three soon after the restart but Jerome headed Olsson's cross straight at Forde. Yet it was not long before the visitors effectively ended the contest as a slip by Millwall's Sid Nelson was capitalised on ruthlessly by Hoolahan, who drove a left-footed strike beyond Forde on 57 minutes. And just three minutes later, the Canaries claimed a fourth all too easily as Jerome broke down the left before calmly delivering the ball across the box

"Manchester City are pressing ahead in their interest for Wolfsburg's Kevin de Bruyne. The Bundesliga side want to keep the Belgium international for at least one more season as they plan a crack at the Champions League next year. However, City, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain are all interested in signing him this summer. Manchester City are pressing ahead with a deal for Wolfsburg playmaker Kevin de Bruyne . De Bruyne has been in fine form for club and country this season and is rated at £40m . De Bruyne celebrates with Marouane Fellaini (c) and Radja Nainggolan after a goal against Cyprus . De Bruyne’s agent Patrick de Koster has hinted it would take a bid close to £40million for Wolfsburg to consider selling. Talking last week he said: ‘Clubs who are ready to bid 30million euros for Kevin have no sense of reality. A player like Kevin has a market value of some €50million, €55m or even €60m by now.’ De Bruyne, 23, cost Wolfsburg £16.7m when he signed in January 2014 from Chelsea and has scored 14 goals for his club this season. City defender Aleksandar Kolarov has admitted he’s tempted by a return to Italy after starting just 11 Premier League games this season. The 29-year-old Serb, who cost £16m from Lazio in 2010, fuelled the speculation while praising the job compatriot Sinisa Mihajlovic has done as manager of third-placed Sampdoria. He told Sky Italia: ‘I’d like to return to Italy, but it’s difficult. ‘I’m happy for Mihajlovic. He’s doing very well, as are Lazio.’ De Bruyne, who signed for Wolfsburg in January 2014, chats with team-mate Andre Schurrle against Mainz . De Bruyne is a former Chelsea youngster but never got a real chance to impress at Stamford Bridge . Meanwhile, Yaya Toure has suggested he may be about to step away from international football, after claiming ‘my target is done’. Toure captained the Ivory Coast to glory in this winter’s Africa Cup of Nations, their first major trophy in over two decades, and could now follow his brother Kolo in retiring after suggesting that the Elephants’ new generation should be allowed to flourish. ‘My future?’ he said. ‘You have to wait. Now, my target is done. The time of the youngsters will come soon. We need to let them. ‘It’s always beautiful when everything is going in the right way. I’m delighted with the trophy of 2015. Now I will wait a couple of days before we decide my future.’

"(CNN)More than 300 suspects have been arrested in South Africa in connection with deadly attacks on foreigners that have forced thousands to flee, the government said Sunday. ""We once again unequivocally condemn the maiming and killing of our brothers and sisters from other parts of the continent,"" the government said. ""No amount of frustration or anger can justify these attacks and looting of shops."" Thousands sought refuge in temporary shelters after mobs with machetes attacked immigrants in Durban. The attacks in Durban killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. Heavily armed police have scrambled to stop clashes after local residents accused immigrants from other African nations of taking their jobs. The government praised law enforcement agencies for stopping further bloodshed in Durban. ""We believe that their commitment to duty has prevented injuries and even deaths that could have happened if they security forces had not acted,"" it said. The xenophobic sentiment is certainly not representative of all South Africans. ""There has been an outpouring of support from ordinary South Africans who are disgusted with the attacks not only because they are foreign, or African, but because they are fellow human beings,"" said Gift of the Givers charity, which is helping those seeking refuge. The charity said last week that about 8,500 people had fled to refugee centers or police stations because of the violence. South Africa's government implored citizens to remember the country's history of overcoming challenges with the support of African neighbors. ""During the Apartheid many South Africans fled persecution and death at the hands of the Apartheid government,"" it said in its statement. ""Africa opened its doors and became a home away from home for many South Africans."" President Jacob Zuma has canceled a trip to Indonesia and visited displaced foreign nationals in Chatsworth to express his support, the government said. The Gift of the Givers charity assured immigrants that it has a facility in Johannesburg to help those who might need shelter there. ""We have tents and all essential supplies on standby but pray that sanity prevails and this does not become necessary,"" it said. In the past, Johannesburg has been the epicenter of anti-immigrant tensions. In 2008, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. In that attack, police arrested more than 200 people for various crimes including rape, murder, robbery and theft. CNN's Larry Register contributed to this report.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)A few months before Nigeria's national elections, both main candidates embraced and promised a peaceful election. That pledge is now under serious threat. Protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state as they marched to protest national elections held to elect Nigeria's next President. ""There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable,"" said Lai Mohammed, spokesman for the main opposition party, the All Peoples Congress. The All Peoples Congress says the vote has been rigged, voters intimidated and demanded that the elections held in Rivers state be canceled. The ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party, refutes the accusation, saying the election was ""credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan."" Heavy rain eventually forced the protesters home, but there are fears that it will take more than rain to stop further protests and violence. ""We are concerned by what seems to be happening,"" said Attahiru Jega, Nigeria's election chairman, about events in Rivers state. Nigeria has just held what are thought to be the closest elections since a return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military rule. The two main candidates are incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan and retired general Muhammedu Buhari. What is at stake in the protests in Rivers state is not whether Nigeria can hold an election, but can it hold a ""close"" election. Voting is now over and the results are being counted. Jega says the final result will likely be announced within 48 hours. The fear is that the results may not be accepted by whomever loses. And if the opposition believes it has been rigged out of victory by the ruling party, then the protests in Rivers state could spread to northern Nigeria. Over 800 people were killed in post-election violence across the north after the 2011 elections were thought to be illegitimate. And so both candidates have taken to social media to call for calm. ""I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results,"" stated Jonathan on his Facebook account. ""Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced,"" said Buhari on Twitter.

"Dina Amos-Larkin (above), 21, has been left paralysed from the neck down after falling 50ft from a hotel balcony in Salou, Spain . A British gymnast has been left paralysed from the neck down after falling 50ft from a hotel balcony. Dina Amos-Larkin was attending a four-day sports festival in Salou, Spain when she fell while talking to her mother on the phone on April 3. The 21-year-old law student, who represents Great Britain at trampolining, was in a medically-induced coma for two weeks and was told of her injuries when she was brought round a week ago. She told Simon Wright of the Sunday Mirror that authorities initially said the fall, from a fourth floor balcony at Hotel Jaime 1, was a suicide bid. 'That isn't the case - I spent the day doing sport and went drinking in the evening, but wasn't drunk,' she said. 'The balcony rail was lower than my waist and I think I just leaned back too far.' The student, from Poole, Dorset, claimed she is now stranded in hospital as she is waiting for her insurer AXA to review her case. A GoFundMe page has since been set up to raise £20,000 to get Miss Amos-Larkin, who is also captain of the Angels cheerleading squad at Surrey University, home. More than £13,900 has already been donated. The page reads: 'Dina Larkin suffered horrendous injuries including paralysis when she fell from a balcony during a student festival in Barcelona. 'Dina is an international gymnast and aspiring law student. But most of all she is a daughter, a sister and a friend to many. 'Her recovery has been halted because the costs of getting her back to the UK amount to over £10,000. And then there's the adaptive care she will need when she is home.' Her mother Audrey, 48, and father Stephen, 49, told the Sunday Mirror their 'hearts are broken'. The street the hotel is on (above) has lots of high-rise apartments with white rails lining each balcony . A GoFundMe page has since been set up to raise £20,000 to get Miss Amos-Larkin (above), who is also captain of the Angels cheerleading squad at Surrey University, home . 'We just want her home,' they added. Her last Tweet was a week before the incident, when she posted a photo of the cheerleading squad after the Team Surrey varsity and wrote: 'These kids know the score! @Surreyangels brought it home.' She added a picture of the sea on Instagram five days later and wrote: 'Enjoying that ocean spray. Let's hope it can cure this hangover #TOUR #spain #sunshine #ocean #saloufest #coastline #teamsurreytour2015.' A spokesman for AXA said: 'We are looking into the circumstances and until those investigations have been completed, it would not be appropriate to comment further. 'We are speaking to Dina and assisting with her repatriation.'

"Jordan Wills works as a paintball target, with colleagues firing paintballs at him at close range . When student Jordan Wills goes to work he must prepared to pelted by bullets, fired at him at close range and at speeds of almost 40mph. The 19-year-old from London works as a human bullet impact tester, or more simply a paintball target, and every week faces the pellets being fired at his torso to test how hard they are on impact or how large a welt they leave. He beat more than 10,000 other applicants from around the world to land the £16,000 a year job as a tester and fits in being used for target practice around his university studies. 'I guess I have a high pain tolerance - but it's really not as painful as people think,' said the Kingston University Computer Graphics student. 'The hardest part is the anticipation when you know it's coming. 'The most times I'd be shot at during a shift is ten over a course of an hour or two.' And while most people playing paintball will wear some form of protective clothing, Mr Wills does his job in just a t-shirt. He is a fan of the game anyway, and has previously played a lot in his spare time. He works 16 hours a week at different UK Paintball sites across the country on a pro-rata salary of £40,000, which works out at a wage of around £16,000 a year. Mr Wills, who stays in shape as a rower, said despite the welts and the occasional pain he loves his job. He added: 'When people find out what I do they think I'm crazy - but I love my job. 'The initial pain lasts for about five seconds, then it stings for maybe ten seconds - and then it's gone. I don't even remember I've been shot.' The teenager wears protective goggles to cover his eyes - but trusts his well-trained colleagues to steer clear of other vulnerable body parts and stop when he tells them to. The paintballs are fired at Jordan's torso at close range - between 25 and 30 feet by a professional shooter at a speed of almost 40mph. Rather than take the usual approach of fleeing the oncoming paintballs, Mr Wills must stand still while players take aim at him. He reports back on the impact of the paintballs so that manufacturers can ensure new batches are not too hard. Anything that draws blood, leaves too serious a mark or does not explode on impact is unacceptable. Mr Wills was selected for the role out of 10,000 other applicants because of his knowledge of paintball . The 19-year-old often suffers welts on his body from the impact which take three or four days to disappear . The practice leaves him with welts over his body, but the student said he barely notices. 'Sometimes I take a hot bath after a shift, but mostly I just forget they're even there,' he added. 'At first my girlfriend didn't like it, but now she's

"Harvey Weinstein's wife has been pictured for the first time this week looking forlorn amid claims her billionaire husband was recorded apologizing to a 22-year-old model for groping her. The producer, 63, has emphatically denied sexually assaulting Ambra Battilana during a business meeting at his Tribeca office last Friday.

'She said something to the effect that she was uncomfortable with him doing that,' the source told the Daily News. 'And he said something to the effect, ""It won't happen again.""' 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her. The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.'

"Given Manny Pacquiao is on his show next week it's just as well Jimmy Kimmel didn't offend the Filipino fighter with his rendition of his inspirational ballad Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino. On his show Jimmy Kimmel Live the comedian sang an excerpt of the song, penned and recorded by Pacquiao to be his walk-out music for the richest fight of all time against Floyd Mayweather.

After singing a few lines, he said: 'That translated into England means ""I'm gonna beat Floyd Mayweather's face in"".' The boxer was nevertheless impressed, and a little amused. After Kimmel's effort sung in the Tagalog, a language spoken by about 57 million of the Philippines' more than 98 million people, went viral Pacman took to Twitter to thank the comedian for singing his song. Pacquiao's 80s-style music video includes a montage of the boxer's fights and his humanitarian efforts .

"A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial.

He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence.

"British Airways could be facing a compensation payout of up to £90,000 following a pungent smell that forced one of its flights to return to Heathrow Airport. The BA flight to Dubai returned to London due to a foul odour emanating from an overflowing toilet, and three passengers have since filed claims for compensation due to the travel disruption. They argue they are entitled to hundreds of pounds each after cabin crew were unable to fix the problem and the flight turned around near Brussels. A British Airways captain told passengers the smell was from 'liquid faecal excrement' in a toilet . Passengers were initially told that they would board another flight in three hours, but it turned into a 15-hour delay. Three passengers have contacted Claim4Flights.com to seek up to €600 each (£450) in compensation, the maximum allowed for a delay of more than four hours when travelling over 2,200 miles as stipulated by EU rules. If all 200 passengers on board the flight were to claim, BA could be forced into paying out up to£90,000. One claimant is Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev, who was travelling to Dubai with his pregnant wife and two-year-old daughter. At the time he took to Twitter to explain how a 'smelly poo in the toilet' had forced the plane to turn back and land at Heathrow. Tory councillor Abhishek Sachdev was travelling with his pregnant wife and their two-year-old daughter . Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev said passengers were told that crew could not fix the problem . Speaking to MailOnline Travel Mr Sachdev, a Tory councillor, said: 'We had booked a night flight to allow my two-and-and-half-year-old daughter to sleep. 'Initially we were told that the delay would be three hours until another flight. When we landed, the pilot said it would be a 15-hour delay, until 1pm the next day. A smell emanating from the toilet on a BA flight forced the plane to turn back (file photo) 'This meant we lost a whole day of our holiday, and that we also had the stress of travelling on a daytime flight with our toddler daughter.' Mr Sachdev decided to lodge a claim with Claim4Flights.com after being unimpressed with how BA officials dealt with the situation. 'At the baggage collection area, we were told by some BA staff to queue for information. After 15 minutes in that queue, we were then told there was no need to do so, and were given a leaflet,' he added. 'This leaflet simply said BA apologised for the technical fault, even though the pilot was clear that there was no technical fault. 'We then had to wait 25 minutes to get our accommodation and food voucher. About five or six staff were trying to print these for us but couldn't because of system problems they said. 'This was now midnight and we had pleaded with them to hurry up but it still took a long time to resolve. Then we got to the hotel, and had to wait another 25 minutes to check in.'

"Controversial: Hertz installed the cameras as part of the in-car NeverLost app in 2014 . Car rental company Hertz has been slammed by customers for putting cameras inside their vehicles. The controversial device was installed as part of the in-car navigation system and guide, NeverLost 6 app, which was introduced in 2014. Drivers fear the lens is a breach of their privacy, but the firm insist they do not work and have no plans to turn them on. They also state they do not have the bandwidth capabilities to support video streaming. The cameras were added so drivers could interact with a member of the customer services team during an emergency or when stationary. To start a conversation, the motorist or a passenger would have been able to turn on the camera themselves - but because of technical difficulties the feature hasn't been integrated into the system. Rich Broome, a spokesman for Hertz, told the Daily Mail Online it would have been completely customer activated and could not have been turned on remotely. He added that there is 'nothing behind the lens' and there is no timetable to connect the device. However some drivers who regularly rent from Hertz have still expressed their concern at the camera's presence. One customer wrote on the forum Flyertalk: 'I am a regular renter from Hertz (President's Circle). This week after the usual excessive wait for the Hertz airport shuttle, I got into a rental car at O'Hare airport. 'I immediately noticed the new NeverLost and I was completely shocked to see a camera built into the device looking at me. The system can't be turned off from what could tell. Further investigation revealed that the camera can see the entire inside of the car. 'I know rental car companies have been tracking the speed and movements of their vehicles for years but putting a camera inside the cabin of the vehicle is taking their need for information a little too far. Breach of privacy? Some drivers have expressed their concern at the presence of the device, but the hire car firm said there is 'nothing behind the lens' and the camera simply doesn't work . 'I find this to be completely unacceptable In fact, if I get another car from Hertz with a camera in it, I will move our business from Hertz completely. I influence car rentals of many others and I don't think anyone would want to be on camera while they are driving around or sitting at a red light. 'Given what Hertz has invested in this system, I wonder how much consumer pressure will make them to pull the plug on this. Business is built one customer at a time and they will no longer have me as a customer.' The company told a Twitter user who criticized the use of the lens: 'The camera in the NeverLost device was never activated as we do not have adequate bandwidth capabilities to the car to support streaming video at this time.' Mr Broome added that if any customer has any concerns with

"Diarist Anne Frank likely died a month earlier than previously thought meaning there was little chance of her surviving the Holocaust, according to new research. It was previously believed that the Jewish teenager, who was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, died of typhus on 31 March 1945, two weeks before the camp was liberated. However a new study puts the date of her death at some point in mid February, meaning that even if British troops had reached the camp a little sooner, she would likely not have survived. Scroll down for video . Anne Frank (pictured) likely died of typhus inside the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in mid February 1945, a study has shown, not on March 31 as previously thought . Anne's diary, which documents how her family went into hiding from the Nazis in the Netherlands during the Second World War, became a bestseller when it was published after then end of the war. The book documents how Anne, her sister Margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house, but were eventually betrayed and sent to Bergen-Belsen, where she and her sister perished. Anne Frank wrote her diary while in hiding from Nazi persecution during World War II. By 1940 the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped. In 1942 the family went into hiding in secret rooms of Otto Frank's office building. But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945. Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame. After the war the Dutch government set the official date of her death as March 31, based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in March. Because the Allies liberated the camp on April 15, this added a bitter twist to her tale - the thought that if she could have hung on a few weeks longer she might have been saved. However, Erika Prins, a researcher at the Anne Frank House museum, has now revised that date having studied witness accounts, archives, and conducted at least one new interview. Ms Prins said she now believes that Anne and her sister began exhibiting symptoms of typhus at the beginning of February. According to Dutch health authorities, most patients do not live for more than 12 days after that. 'In view of this, the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in February. The exact date is unknown,' the study says. Ms Prins added: 'It was horrible. It was terrible. And it still is. But when you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. Bergen-Belsen was liberated in April 1945, meaning if Anne died in March, then she was two weeks from rescue. But this new study shows she was months from safety (Anne pictured left, with father Otto, and right)

"Brendan Rodgers has criticised Raheem Sterling’s advisor, suggesting that the player is being manipulated by outside forces and that he would be inclined to stay at Liverpool if left to make a decision alone. With Liverpool losing 4-1 at Arsenal on Saturday and seeing their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season effectively ending, Rodgers made veiled criticisms of the player’s agent, Aidy Ward, after the televised interview Sterling gave last week, in which he admitted he was flattered by Arsenal’s interest in him. Rodgers also revealed that he has sat down with Sterling since that TV interview and to tell him that his best interest would be served by staying at the club for now, even though there may come a time when he does leave.

Sterling has reject a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal at the end of this season, but Rodgers said: ‘I’ve had a good chat with him. I have given him my opinion on it. This is a young kid who has been advised to do something else. A 20-year-old boy does not pick up the phone to ask to speak to the BBC. ‘You don’t do that; him in particular. He just wants to play his football. But of course if he’s asked to do that by other parties then that’s what he’ll do. ‘In the modern game it is obviously something that frustrates us all but it is the market and where football is at. In fairness to Raheem, I brought him in from the youth team and the reserves and I know that a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him.’ Sterling has rejected a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal . ‘In my time in coaching there are a lot of very, very good agents. The only thing I would say on Raheem’s situation is that anyone can see that for his football development and financially, Liverpool Football Club is the best place for him. There is absolutely no question of that. ‘I think he enjoys being at Liverpool and loves playing for Liverpool and knows he is privileged to play in front of Liverpool supporters. As a kid he knows the opportunity is there for him to improve as a footballer. What that will be in five, six, seven years time is different.

"The classic advice was given to me first by no less a figure than Dame Barbara Cartland — then aged 90 — at one of her bizarre lunches to launch yet another romantic novel. She was busy rattling off a roster of men who had proposed to her over the decades, when she broke off and fixed a skinny guest with her gimlet eye. ‘After 40,’ she told me, ‘a woman has to choose between her face and her figure. My advice is, keep a lovely, plump pretty face, and stay sitting down.’ Scroll down for video . Former model and actress Candice Bergen, 68, admits in her recent memoir that food is fun, and that it is ridiculous and sad to vomit or starve to stay stick-thin . Then she took to a chair to demonstrate, in a froth of princess-pink tulle from which her elaborately painted face rose in triumph. As she got up again and started working the room, distributing souvenir gold-leaf acorns from her garden and finishing the list of long-deceased suitors — the object of her remarks, a skinny fellow journalist, scowled and fiddled with her lettuce. I — past 40 by then — smiled my chubbiest, most complacent smile. It’s not often my tribe get our bums and faces validated over those of grumpy glamazons. In Bergen's (pictured in the 1960's) memoir she merrily admits to putting on more than 2st over the past 15 years . Now, that face-and-figure tip has been reiterated by Candice Bergen, former model, actress and Oscar nominee, whose memoir A Fine Romance will be published soon. In it, 68-year-old Bergen merrily admits that over the past 15 years she has put on more than 2st. ‘I am a champion eater. No carb is safe,’ she joshes. Food is fun, she believes, and it is ridiculous and sad that her contemporaries either starve or vomit in secret to stay stick-thin. Bergen sounds a riot, just the girl for a grand night out. She also sounds — and here’s the key — confident and sexy. None of that weird, skeletal, Sarah Jessica Parker or Victoria Beckham vibe for her, nor that gristly, hard-body Madonna look, all abs and biceps. Oscar nominee Candice Bergen (pictured) is confident, sexy and fun, despite putting on more than 2st over the last 15 years . Her brand of femininity, which is shared by domestic goddess Nigella Lawson, is a bounce and a grin, a wink and a cuddle. The buxom woman’s image may not suit the gay-dominated fashion industry or the anxious self-hating celebrity circuit, but children (and, frankly, most men) gravitate towards the comfortable female form. Both have an entirely natural instinct to bond with a female who seems fun, comfy, confident and able to enjoy her food. Bergen and Nigella's healthy, curvy figures differ from the tiny frames of celebs such as Victoria Beckham (pictured) and Sarah Jessica Parker . Indeed, scientists lately delighted us with news that the particular sort of fat on the female backside is rather special. It is vital for

"A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house has been spared jail. He was sentenced by Judge Noel Lucas (above) at Guildford Crown Court . A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house while her live-in carer was out has been spared jail. Timothy Norris-Jones, who had previously attacked his mother on two occasions, left her with bruises on her face and a cut on her right wrist that needed stitches, a court heard. The 59-year-old told police the injuries were caused when she fell and said he had accidentally 'caught her face' when he went to catch her in November last year. He was arrested after the victim's carer returned home and called the police. His mother later told detectives: 'He just blew up. 'He was pushing my face and holding my wrists. I can remember I said: ""Stop this Tim, don't do it"".' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. A forensic psychologist told the court that emotionally damaged Norris-Jones looked to his mother for support and 'lost his rag' when she could not provide it. Judge Noel Lucas, sentencing, branded the attack 'horrific' and added: 'It is pretty unforgivable to strike an elderly lady.' He said: 'You gave your mother a systematic beating. 'If I had taken the view that your actions were anything other than those of an ill and weak man, I would now be sending you to prison for a substantial amount of time.' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. Above, a picture of the street where the assault happened . 'I hope you are thoroughly ashamed of yourself.' Nick Tucker, defending, said: 'It's clear from her statement that [the victim] loves her son and she's concerned for him, despite what she's suffered. 'One of the reasons this is not only sad, but a difficult case, is that we can't confidently say why this happened. 'The defendant is unable to explain what triggered this or the previous assaults.' Norris-Jones was handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, at Guildford Crown Court (above) and will have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet enforcing a strict 12-month curfew . Norris-Jones, from Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, admitted two counts of ABH and was cleared of one count of GBH when he appeared at Guildford Crown Court.

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton is now officially a candidate for president -- and the never ending Clinton story rumbles on. She has been a part of all our lives now for approaching a quarter of a century. She started as the first lady that the right loved to hate, then the deceived wife, next a senator, then a candidate for president in one of the most dynamic primaries in history and finally, a secretary of state. The Republicans have their aristocratic Bushes, the Democrats have their Clintons. And if Hillary or Jeb were to win two presidential terms, then in the 44 years from 1981 to 2025, 28 will have had a Clinton or a Bush in the White House. The great American republic now looks about as democratic as ""Game of Thrones."" But even though Hillary Clinton has been around nearly my entire lifetime, The Economist may speak for many when it asks: ""What does Hillary stand for?"" There is a paradox she presents: She is by far the best-known presidential candidate across both parties and, for the moment, almost unchallenged within her own. Yet even though Diane Feinstein can assert confidently that Hillary ""doesn't 'need' (the White House). But she wants it"" -- the question unanswered is ""What for?"" And for liberals, who believe that government is there to do something, it's this lack of definition that is surely so disconcerting about Clinton. There are good grounds for a liberal primary challenge to Clinton. The economy has revived under Obama but, say critics, largely to the benefit of Wall Street and the super-rich. The riots in Ferguson, Missouri, were a painful reminder that the poor, particularly the nonwhite poor, have been left behind. Clinton's credentials as a fighter against inequality are mixed. It is true, as the Wall Street Times notes, that she has previously called for ""universal prekindergarten, equal pay for women, increases in the minimum wage, paid family leave, higher taxes on the wealthy and an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for working-poor families."" But she counts among her friends precisely those corporate people blamed by the Occupy crowd for the country's inequality. Clinton is now, wisely, trying to distance herself from the Clinton Foundation -- after all, its fundraising efforts among foreign interests are hardly the stuff of populist liberalism. Then there is her foreign policy record. Clinton voted in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War (though in her memoir last year, she backed away from the vote, writing that she ""got it wrong."") As secretary of state, she is easily associated in the mind of the left with such controversies as the war in Syria, the crisis in Libya and the collapse of the Mubarak regime in Egypt. That some of these may have had little to do with her is beside the point. Clinton is going to have to spend a sizeable amount of time during the primaries explaining and defending the things that occurred while she was working for the Obama administration. Her personal ethics are on the agenda, too -- as demonstrated by the flap

"Britain was hailed as a ‘job-creating machine’ last night as the number of people in work soared to its highest level in history. The Conservatives’ economic strategy also won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne. Employment rose above 31million in the three months to February, official figures showed – 557,000 higher than a year before. The Conservatives’ economic strategy won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together. ‘There are now two million more people in work than in 2010,’ the Prime Minister said. The encouraging numbers came as Rolls-Royce announced its biggest-ever order, worth more than £6billion, to power passenger jets for the Middle Eastern airline Emirates. IMF chief Christine Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble praised Mr Osborne’s ‘wonderful job’ of handling the economy. In a blow to Labour, which has opposed most of the Government’s austerity measures, Mrs Lagarde said the Government had provided the ‘right balance’ of spending cuts and tax rises. The plan had reduced the deficit from a record £153billion under Labour in 2009-10 to £90billion last year. She said she had ‘no doubt that can continue to be the case in the future’ under Mr Osborne’s plans to return Britain to the black in 2018-19, a pledge Labour has failed to match. David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together . ‘The fiscal deficit has been significantly reduced over the last few years,’ said Mrs Lagarde. ‘Added to that it is clearly also delivering results. It is obvious that what is happening in the UK has actually worked.’ Mr Schaeuble said he was ‘full of respect’ for what the Chancellor has achieved and delivered what amounted to a highly unusual endorsement of the Tories. ‘The UK and the UK economy has done a wonderful job in the last couple of years,’ he said. ‘The UK and George Osborne has a very good plan for the future. I am very much in favour of what has been achieved and what has been forecast.’ The Chancellor, speaking at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, said the UK ‘is one of the brightest spots in the world economy at the moment’. ‘I am here representing the UK with an economy that is firmly on course – the deficit halved as a share of GDP, strong growth, record high employment, record low inflation,’ he said. Greece poses the biggest threat to the global economy and the deepening crisis could hit Britain, George Osborne warned yesterday. Fears are mounting that the recession-battered country will default on its debts and be forced to leave the eurozone, creating an economic and political earthquake.

"A top grammar school that was fined £10,000 after a 14-year-old pupil was hit in the head during a shot put event had to call another ambulance to the premises after a boy ran into a wall, during a 100m sprint. Governors of the Judd School in Tonbridge, Kent, admitted failing to ensure the safety of a 14 year-old boy who nearly died from head injuries after being hit with a metal shot. But less than a week after the case was heard by magistrates, paramedics returned to the school when a 12 year-old pupil reportedly ran into a wall following a 100 metre sprint. The Judd School was fined £10,000 last week after a 14-year-old pupil was hit in the head during a shot put event when too many sports were going on at the same time. Last week the school had to call an ambulance after another pupil is believed to have been injured after running into a wall during a 100m sprint event . The year eight pupil had to be treated at the scene and then taken to hospital after being injured after he ran into a wall at the prestigious school at about 1pm last Friday, headmaster Robert Masters confirmed. The boy suffered a bang to his forehead and was taken to Pembury Hospital in Tunbridge Wells, a South East Coast Ambulance spokesman said. He is no longer in hospital. Days earlier Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court heard the school failed to follow its own safety guidelines during a PE lesson last June where a pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull during a shot put event. Pupils were taking part in six field sports on June 20 last year. The lesson included discus, triple jump, long jump, javelin, hurdles and the shot put. But health and safety guidelines say the 1,000-pupil school should have had a maximum of four sports, with just one throwing event, going on at the same time. After he was injured the year nine pupil was rushed to King's College Hospital in London for emergency brain surgery because parts of his skull had gone into his brain, causing swelling. He was in hospital for almost a month. A pupil was hit on the head by a shot during an athletics session on the shot put field (pictured) last year . Magistrates heard the boy had returned to the school but will have to live with 'the consequences' of the incident for the rest of his life. He was formerly a keen rugby player but has been told he will never play again. The school was charged with breaching their general duty to the pupil and pleaded guilty. Magistrates said the safety breach was 'substantial' and ordered the the school to pay £10,000 in fines and £1,375 in costs.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)A day after winning Nigeria's presidency, Muhammadu Buhari told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he plans to aggressively fight corruption that has long plagued Nigeria and go after the root of the nation's unrest. Buhari said he'll ""rapidly give attention"" to curbing violence in the northeast part of Nigeria, where the terrorist group Boko Haram operates. By cooperating with neighboring nations Chad, Cameroon and Niger, he said his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals and others contributing to Nigeria's instability. For the first time in Nigeria's history, the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections. Buhari defeated incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by about 2 million votes, according to Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission. The win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in Africa's most populous nation. In an exclusive live interview from Abuja, Buhari told Amanpour he was not concerned about reconciling the nation after a divisive campaign. He said now that he has been elected he will turn his focus to Boko Haram and ""plug holes"" in the ""corruption infrastructure"" in the country. ""A new day and a new Nigeria are upon us,"" Buhari said after his win Tuesday. ""The victory is yours, and the glory is that of our nation."" Earlier, Jonathan phoned Buhari to concede defeat. The outgoing president also offered a written statement to his nation. ""I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country, and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,"" Jonathan said. ""I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word."" Buhari, 72, will be sworn in on May 29. He will take the helm at a critical time, as Nigeria grapples with Boko Haram, serious economic woes and corruption. This isn't Buhari's first time leading Nigeria, but it's his first time in nearly 30 years. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983, closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari. But Buhari himself was ousted by another military coup in August 1985. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? His presidential win is the result of his fourth attempt to lead the country since he was ousted 30 years ago. Buhari is a Sunni Muslim from Nigeria's poorer North, while Jonathan comes from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. Buhari praised voters for exercising their right peacefully. ""Your vote affirms that you believe Nigeria's future can be better than what it is today,"" he said in his statement. ""You voted for change, and now change has come."" Buhari campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime. He stressed that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. His campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of ""new broom,"" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. Despite years of democracy,

"An Egyptian court has sentenced a popular Armenian belly dancer to six months in prison for 'insulting the Egyptian flag' after she wore a tight dress in its red, white and black color scheme. The court in Agouza, west of Cairo, said Sofinar Gourian, popularly known as 'Safinaz', was fined £15,000 after being found guilty in a case raised by a private complainant. She is expected to avoid jail time, however, after paying £10,000 bail and launching an appeal against the six month prison sentence. Offending dress: An Egyptian court has sentenced popular Armenian belly dancer 'Safinaz' to six months in prison for 'insulting the Egyptian flag' after she wore a tight dress in its red, white and black color scheme . Insulting the flag was made illegal by decree under Egyptian President Adly Mansour who ruled for a year after the army overthrew an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013. The change in law made it a crime to raise, display or sell an Egyptian flag if it is damaged in any way, or even if the colour has faded. The law also prohibits adding slogans, designs or pictures to the Egyptian flag. Ms Gourian is understood to have worn a costume made from the material taken from an Egyptian flag during a belly dancing performance in the town of Ain Sokhna in 2013. The belly dancer, who lives in Egypt, had argued that she did not insult the flag intentionally and as a foreigner was less aware of Egyptian laws. Harsh laws: Insulting the Egyptian flag was made illegal by decree under President Adly Mansour who ruled for a year after the army overthrew an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013 . The complaint against her was filed by a businesswoman and hotel owner in Mohandeseen who found the performance insulting, according to Ahram Online. Although she has been convicted of the crime, her £10,000 bail allows her to remain free until her appeal has been heard. Ms Gourian has lived and worked in Egypt for the past two years, where her act has proven to be an immediate success. The Armenian native has already appeared in several Egyptian movies, performed at society weddings and is married to an Egyptian national. Ms Gourian has previously told reporters she hopes to spend the rest of her life in the country.

"The BBC boss who insulted nearly half the country earns an enormous salary without even working full-time, it emerged yesterday. Trying to rebut allegations of BBC elitism, £330,000-a-year Alan Yentob insisted the corporation did make programmes for C2s and DEs – a technical term for the working classes. Viewers said his comments on Newsnight were arrogant and showed he was out of touch. And yesterday the BBC had to admit that – despite commanding a salary more than twice that of the Prime Minister – Mr Yentob’s job is ‘not a contracted full-time role’. Part-time worker: Alan Yentob, pictured, is paid £183,000-a-year as the BBC's creative director, and gets a separate salary as editor and presenter of BBC programmes such as the arts series Imagine . In an embarrassing series of letters, the BBC also struggled to explain what he does as creative director, claiming it is ‘highly specialised and bespoke role unique to him’. Asked for Mr Yentob’s job description, it said that he was ‘a leading figure in the broadcast world’ but was unable to detail his duties. The 68-year old media grandee is paid one salary of £183,300 a year for his work as creative director, and another as editor and presenter of BBC programmes such as the arts series Imagine. He has refused to say exactly how much this is, but BBC insiders says it is ‘easily’ in the region of £150,000 a year, bringing his total package to around £330,000. On Wednesday Mr Yentob was wheeled out to explain the decision to sack Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear but was ridiculed for bungling his lines. Fluffed: Yentob appeared on Newsnight to explain the decision to sack Jeremy Clarkson (pictured) but was ridiculed for bungling his lines . He claimed Mr Clarkson had ‘already suffered’ by being dropped from the show and it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest he shouldn’t be paid until the end of his contract. Mr Yentob then said the BBC did not cater only for the metropolitan elite saying it ‘reached out to…C2s [and] DEs’ – who account for more than 46 per cent of the population. Last night, John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP from Birmingham Yardley, called for an investigation into Mr Yentob’s pay. ‘It sounds to me a lot like somebody who is a popular person within the BBC hierarchy getting a bung for just existing,’ he said. ‘There should be an inquiry into where the value for money is.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘As creative director, Alan oversees the BBC’s creative strategy across all content and services including acting as the focal point for all BBC talent management. ‘Alan has also built the BBC’s partnerships with arts and cultural organisations across the UK.’

"The Black Hawk helicopter that crashed in dense fog during a training mission in Florida was carrying seven Marines from Special Operations Command forces based in North Carolina, and four National Guard soldiers from Louisiana. Bad weather prevented the recovery of bodies and the flight recorder from the wreckage on Thursday, and while the military had not officially released any times, loved one of those on the doomed copter did speak with the press.. Now however, the names and identities of the seven Marines have been revealed. Scroll down for video . Crews lower a piece of a Black Hawk helicopter onto a barge in the Santa Rosa Sound near Pritchard Point in Florida . Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif (left) and Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock (right) Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif was a Silver Star Medal recipient who received the award for facing enemy fire to save a mortally wounded friend in Afghanistan in July 2012. He was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until middle-school when his family moved to Holland, Michigan, the Marines said. Seif, 26, grew up playing soldier in his backyard and joined the Marines just weeks after graduating from high school, according to an article about his award published this week in the Camp Lejeune Globe, the post newspaper. By 2012, he had spent two years as a special forces operator with the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, which operates from the Middle East to Central Asia. Seif and his teammate, Sgt. Justin Hansen, were closing in on one of western Afghanistan's bomb experts, according to the paper. They came under fire, and Hansen was hit. Seif moved Hansen to safer position and treated his teammate's wounds. Seif returned fire, advanced alone across the compound and found the targeted bomb-maker. 'The fact that (Seif) continued to fight through the objective to get Sgt. Hansen taken care of, putting himself in the line of fire, speaks volumes to who he is and demonstrates that he would never leave a Marine behind,' said Maj. Gen. Joseph L. Osterman. Seif's wife was at his side when he received the medal. Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock, 29, was born in Lake Orion, Michigan, and swam on the varsity swim team. He attended Henry Ford Community College for one year before joining the Marine Corps in 2006. Initially, he was a mechanic in an armored reconnaissance battalion at Camp Pendleton in California. He served two tours in Iraq in 2007 and 2008. His decorations include the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Valor.

"(CNN)Are the upcoming elections in Israel crucial? Will the results -- a fourth term for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or a first for opposition leader Isaac Herzog -- change Israel's policy in a significant way? As Israelis prepare to go to the polls, the answer seems to be negative. Many observers in Europe and the United States seem to be under the impression that during Netanyahu's time in power, Israel was hijacked by right wing zealots -- and that Herzog, leader of the Zionist Union opposition party, is the man who will save the country and return it to the path of sanity. But the fact is that when it comes to the most crucial question regarding the future of Israel and the Middle East -- what to do about the Palestinians -- the difference between the two candidates is negligible, a divergence that is short on substance but long on style and rhetoric. While Netanyahu's insistence on Israel's continued ruling over millions of Palestinians is expressed in aggressive, often religious and nationalistic language, Herzog's justifications for doing the same thing would sound much softer and easier to digest in the Western world. But at the end of the day, neither Netanyahu nor Herzog have any real intention to put an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories. Netanyahu says it clearly and openly; Herzog and his coalition partners only hint at it. READ MORE: 5 key issues for next Israeli leader . This whitewash has been so evident throughout the entire election campaign that a foreigner arriving in Israel would have had a hard time understanding anything about what is really going on here. The main issues that have been discussed during the campaign are economic ones -- cost of living, housing prices, government oversight -- but even then, slogans and populist promises have largely replaced the in-depth debates we should be having. But the topics that seem to have consumed most of the headlines range from pure gossip to scandals, some of them concerning the behavior of Netanyahu and his wife Sara. There was the ""bottlegate"" affair -- claims that the wife of the Prime Minister had pocketed cash from bottle recycling at their official residence. The Netanyahus say they reimbursed the government. Israel is a country that is still looking for its way forward; one that lacks internationally recognized borders; one that has not yet decided whether it is a Western society or a Middle Eastern one; one that cannot decide whether it wants to be religious or secular, Jewish or bi-national. All of these critical issues -- none of them decided on -- have been cast aside, ignored, covered up or denied by a country that has busied itself with the important business of recycled bottles at the prime minister's residence. There is a big elephant in the room, but Israel is turning its back to it. There is a big elephant in the room, but Israel believes that if nobody talks about it, the elephant does not exist.

"Debra Winch, 44, receives up to 60 spam text messages every day after she was turned down for a payday loan . Highly sensitive financial details from loan applications are being sold to scammers and cold-calling firms, the Mail can reveal. Details of how much money applicants asked for, why the cash was needed and why the application was rejected are all being stored on lists and traded. Vulnerable people desperate for cash are then bombarded up to 60 times a day by cold callers and targeted by scammers who have apparently obtained access to the data. The loan records of more than 3,000 applicants were passed to undercover Mail reporters by one data firm. When the Mail contacted people on the spreadsheet, they said their lives had been made a misery since they applied for the loans. Some said they have been targeted by scammers because their bank details had been made widely available. Policeman’s wife Debra Winch, 44, receives up to 60 spam text messages every day after she had an application for a £600 payday loan declined. The mother of three has since been conned out of £360 by two companies which knew her bank account details and removed the money without her knowledge. Afterwards, one of the scammers spoke to her on the phone and said ‘Catch me if you can’ before hanging up. Mrs Winch said: ‘Having a policeman husband and a son who works in security, I try to be careful giving my information, so am upset my information has got into the hands of the wrong people. ‘I haven’t signed any forms and wouldn’t because I don’t know who I’m dealing with. I feel completely violated. It is amazing how much they know about you.’ The loan records were passed to the Mail’s undercover reporters by Birmingham-based firm Targeted Response Direct. Scroll down for video . The data – including the applicants’ names, addresses, work details, how much they had tried to borrow, what they wanted the loan for and why it was turned down – was sent to the reporters as a free sample via email in two spreadsheets, neither of which was password protected. David Billington, a director of Targeted Response Direct, said people kept these records because there was ‘money in it’. When asked where the information came from, he named four payday loan broker websites: www.little-loans.com, www.supaloans.co.uk, www.gocheaploans.co.uk and www.supafinance.co.uk. David Billington (left) director of Targeted Response Direct (pictured with colleague Nick Moore) claimed people kept these records because there was 'money in it' Last night, the City watchdog said such exploitation was unacceptable and vowed to crack down on the firms involved. And the owner of three of the loan sites involved said it had stopped trading in customers’ data after being contacted by the Mail.

"Cesc Fabregas perks up when he talks about the killer instinct, the ruthless streak that all teams develop at the start of a success story. On instant recall is the World Cup in 2010, when Spain turned to every available resource to reach the final after titanic struggles against Paraguay in the last eight and Germany in the semi-final.

Chelsea’s dressing room is developing a winning mentality again, lifting their first trophy together at Wembley 10 days ago when Jose Mourinho’s team won the Capital One Cup. It has given them belief. ‘When you unlock the mental fear of the quarter-final, which is what we did with the national team, we felt we could become champions,’ said Fabregas. ‘Once we were champions we were unstoppable, but you have to take this fear out and take it away. We have to believe we are the best. ‘We have to be ready mentally to win every situation because this game will not be a walk in the park.’ He was talking about Wednesday evening’s opponents Paris Saint-Germain, a tough nut to crack in the Champions League as Laurent Blanc’s team arrive in London protecting an unbeaten run that stretches back to January 10. Fabregas likes what he sees in the Chelsea dressing room and yet his experience, after nearly 500 appearances for club and country, tells him there is still room for improvement. ‘If there is one thing missing it is killing teams,’ he admitted. ‘Sometimes we don’t kill them when we have the chance. ‘When we score one we have to score more and more. That’s the only way we can really improve, developing that killer instinct.’ Chelsea can smother teams, a tactic Jose Mourinho has refined quite brilliantly over the years with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid.

"A man who passed out at a friend's party woke up with more than a hangover when he discovered a guest had tattooed his back. While Josh Darnbrough, 24, slept, his mate Rob Gaskell, also 24, inked the words 'If found face down call an ambulance' on his back, using a DIY kit. Josh, from Mossley, near Ashton, only discovered the prank the following day after looking in a mirror - and said his partner went 'absolutely bonkers' when she saw it. Josh Darnbrough awoke after a party to find that his friend had tattooed his back . Josh (centre) was tattooed by his friend Rob Gaskell (right) who was taking revenge on his mate after Josh had attempted to tattoo Rob with an at-home kit and it went horribly wrong . Rob said he carried out the practical joke on Josh, who had passed out at a New Year's Eve party, in revenge for a tattoo Josh did on Rob's leg two years ago - which had gone horribly wrong. Starting off with a design for a lizard, Josh tried to turn it into a cross, then some hands and a gun - leading to one almighty, permanent mess on Rob's leg and causing his partner to go 'bonkers'. So when he saw Josh passed out at the party, Rob - who is a father of three - said he 'couldn't resist' the opportunity to execute revenge - and spent 30 minutes etching his own design into his mate's back. Amazingly, the prank hasn't harmed the pair's friendship - and the childhood friends, who are both having their tattoos removed, still see each other every day. But Rob does admit to regretting the prank once he had sobered up. He said: 'The opportunity presented itself and I couldn't resist. 'I didn't feel guilty when I was doing it because I'd had a few drinks myself but I was quite remorseful afterwards and asked everyone not to tell Josh who had done it.' Josh, who is a support worker, said although it was a shock, he has managed to see the funny side. 'I was pretty astonished when I looked in the mirror - I thought, ""I didn't go to bed with a tattoo""', he said. 'I didn't know when I'd got it and no one would tell me who'd done it. But since I found out it was Rob it hasn't affected our friendship at all - we still see each other every day. It's just practical jokes between mates.' Rob, also a support worker, added that he would advise anyone against at-home tattoos. 'We had bought a DIY tattoo kit online and originally it was a well-intentioned exercise,' he said. 'Then when it didn't turn out right it dawned on me this was forever and I was stuck with it. The pair are both getting their tattoos removed by laser technician Maria Patricia (right) and say the incident hasn't affected their friendship .

"This £150,000 Lamborghini Gallardo has just crashed into a tree, careered into the middle of the road and smashed a concrete bollard to smithereens. It also lost a wheel which came flying off, missing a child and her grandfather by little more than 10ft. And the reaction of the driver? The young man, who has not been identified, is said to have just laughed and told onlookers it did not matter the 202mph supercar was a write-off because he would just ‘buy another one tomorrow’. Scroll down for video . A Lamborghini was left severely damaged after it was crashed into a tree and a bollard, causing one of the rear wheels of the £250,000 supercar to fly off and narrowly miss a man who was walking his granddaughter home . Private security worker Martin Johnson, 46, was walking his nine-year-old granddaughter Charly Pennett home from school when he narrowly missed being caught up in the crash in Beaumont Leys, Leicestershire. ‘As we came to the main road we heard a throaty roar which made us turn our heads and that’s when we saw this exotic orange-coloured sports car come around the corner at speed,’ he said. ‘We were lucky really because the large wheel came bouncing through the air at about chest height barely 10ft away. If we were there just a couple of minutes earlier it could have been a different story. ‘The kids were very, very scared but when the driver got out he was laughing and after a while started to boast that he would “just go out and buy another one tomorrow”.’ Martin Johnson said he was walking his granddaughter Charly Pennett home when the wheel flew past . Onlookers claimed the owner of the supercar crashed close to a school and said he would buy another . A rear wheel span off the back of the car due to the force of the crash in Beaumont Leys, Leicestershire . The 5.2litre car was left badly damaged by the crash, with the back left wheel of the 550 horse power vehicle completely ripped from its axle. A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said: 'Police received a call to a report of single vehicle road traffic collision on Strasbourg Drive.

"Convicted Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan who turned to God after being handed a death sentence in Indonesia has been ordained as a Christian minister. After six long years of study inside Bali's Kerobokan jail, the 31-year-old was ordained inside the prison's chapel last month as he found out his and Myuran Sukumaran's plea for clemency from Indonesian president Joko Widodo had been rejected again. The Sydney man was ordained by Christie Buckingham, a senior pastor with the Bayside Church in Melbourne, who bought with her a letter of accreditation approving Chan as a Christian minister in Australia. Scroll down for video . Convicted Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan (left), seen here with Matius Arif Mirdjaja who he baptised, has now been ordained as a Christian minsiter . Five senior ministers from different denominations endorsed Chan after he spent years studying the religion and helping drug addicts within the prison. Reverend Buckingham told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'I have never experienced a student like Andrew, and probably never will again. He is extraordinary. He has such a determination to learn, in fact almost a desperation.' 'He is the real deal, and Myuran [Sukumaran] is as well. They are living proof that people can change, circumstances can change. Indonesia should be proud of the impact they are having,' she added. Sukumaran and Chan await transfer from Kerobokan prison to the death island of Nusakambangan, where they are set to face the firing squad . Sukumaran (left) and Chan (right) are both said to be changed men since they were arrested in 2015 on heroin smuggling charges . Reverend Buckingham first met the pair in 2011 after her friend founded Indonesian charity group Yayasan Tangan Kasih (Arms of Love) which works in Kerobokan prison. In February, a former inmate of Kerobokan prison told Daily Mail Australia how he was baptised by the Bali Nine member. He said Chan helped him kick his 20-year drug addiction, and called on the Indonesian government to show the Australian mercy. When Matius Arif Mirdjaja first spoke to Andrew Chan in prison in 2011 he mocked him for his religious beliefs. The pair knew of each other from the previous three times Mirdjaja had been ordered to serve time but had never spoken. After Mirdjaja was baptised, he and Chan (second left) started up a Bible study group inside Kerobokan prison . It was not until Mirdjaja (pictured) personally witnessed Chan's devotion to God that he started to believe in Christianity . In 2011, the Indonesian - who is now 40 years old - was imprisoned for robbery. '[The first time we spoke] we had a debate about philosophy and Christianity,' Mirdjaja told Daily Mail Australia. 'At that time, I mocked him because I said that 'The Christian foundation is a really silly thing to believe. How do you as a Christian believe in someone who died on the cross and couldn't save his own ass and you expect him to save your ass?'' Mirdjaja said Chan did not get offended by this exchange and just smiled

"Chris Smalling has signed a three-year contract extension at Manchester United worth in the region of £80,000-a-week after turning his career around at Old Trafford. The 25-year-old England centre-back had been linked with a move to Arsenal after struggling to hold down a first-team place at United and being branded ‘stupid’ by manager Louis van Gaal for his sending-off in the Manchester derby at the Etihad earlier this season. Smalling was also guilty of several off-the-field indiscretions, including being pictured going to a fancy-dress party as a suicide bomber last year. Chris Smalling (left) signs his new Manchester United contract alongside club boss Louis van Gaal . Smalling celebrates scoring United's fourth goal during their 4-2 Premier League win against Manchester City . But the defender has matured under Van Gaal and become a regular starter in the Dutchman’s team this season. He was due to be out of contract next summer but has now committed himself to United until 2019. Van Gaal said: ‘I am delighted he has signed a new contract. Chris has improved and developed immensely during the short time that I have been at the club and has become an integral part of the first-team squad. ‘He always conducts himself in a very professional manner and it is also pleasing that he has scored some important goals this season too.’ Smalling, who cost United £10million from Fulham in 2010, has made 147 appearances and won two Premier League titles. Four of his nine goals for the club have come this season, including one in the Old Trafford derby earlier this month as United beat City 4-2. The 25-year-old has become a regular for Van Gaal after struggling for a first time place earlier this season . He said: ‘I am so proud to play for such a great club. We have developed as a team over the course of the season under Louis van Gaal and we are now playing as a complete unit. ‘This is a very exciting time to be at Manchester United. We are all determined to get back to where we belong and competing at the highest level.’ Smalling has established himself as a permanent member of England's squad during the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign and that boils down to his vast improvement under Van Gaal. Smalling shakes hands with Dutch boss Van Gaal after signing his new long-term deal . Smalling has made 147 appearances for United and won two Premier League titles along the way . With a top four finish and Champions League qualification close to being secured, the 25-year-old can look forward to more European adventures as his development continues. After the disappointment of last season, Van Gaal has instilled a level of confidence into his players and Smalling has thrived under his tenure since the turn of the year. The former Fulham man is keeping big summer signing Marcos Rojo out of the side at and that's testament to his improvements after a difficult start to the season. Smalling is expected to keep his place in United's starting eleven

"Lucas Matthysse won a majority decision against Ruslan Provodnikov in a 12-round super lightweight bout on Saturday night. Matthysse landed the majority of the punches in the first round and opening a cut near Provodnikov's left eye early in the second. Provodnikov (24-3) put Matthysse on the ropes late in the third round and landed two hard right hook-left hook combos in the fourth before Matthysse (37-3) regained control in the fifth. He continued to use his three-inch reach advantage to keep Provodnikov at bay, giving him room to dodge the Russian's powerful left hook.

Provodnikov landed several punches in the later rounds but couldn't knock down his Argentine opponent down, although he did stagger Matthysse in the 11th. 'He did, he hurt me,' Matthysse said through a translator. 'But I was able to withstand the onslaught. He's a very tough fighter. He's very strong. He just keeps coming forward.' Don Ackerman scored the fight as a draw 114-114, but Glenn Feldman and John McKaie both scored it 115-113 in favor of Matthysse. 'To me, he was better today,' Provodnikov said through a translator. 'He was the better man in the ring and, you know, it was a close fight but he won and I hope everybody enjoyed it.' The night's undercard was quickly decided when Patrick Teixeira (25-0, 21 KOs) won with a second-round knockout of Patrick Allotey (30-2) in their middleweight bout. Provodnikov admitted that Matthysse was better than him on the day in the majority decision win . Matthysse said he just wanted to rest but talked up a fight with Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao next . The sell-out crowd then had to wait more than an hour for the main event, watching the TV feed of Terence Crawford beating Thomas Dulorme for the vacant WBO junior welterweight title in Austin, Texas. WBO president Paco Valcarcel tweeted he would like to see Crawford defend his title against Matthysse, but the Argentinian had his sights set higher. 'For right now I just want to rest,' Matthysse said. 'I got my daughter, my family waiting for me back home. I want to rest. I want to go back there and see them so much and let's see what happens with (Manny) Pacquiao and (Floyd) Mayweather.'

"Fresh fears were raised last night that Greece could exit the eurozone after it was claimed negotiations with its European creditors were ‘not working’. An official at the International Monetary Fund reportedly admitted that he cannot envisage a successful conclusion to the country’s bailout. Greece this week repeated threats to stop paying off its loan and default on its debt if Europe refuses to release more funds. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors . This would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone, although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's Europe Director has been quoted by the Greek media as saying he could not see a successful conclusion to the country's current bail out. The fund's Europe chief reportedly told his executive board that negotiations were not going as hoped, the Daily Telegraph reported. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors. One Greek official has been quoted by the Financial Times as saying that if the European Central Bank did not play ball with the Mediterranean Eurozone member there could be no alternative to a default. Mr. Thomsen also issued a warning over Greece's recent, weak economic performance. He met with Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis earlier this month. Greece repaid a roughly €450 million loan instalment to the International Monetary last week but Athens' financial problems, as outlined by Mr. Thomsen, have renewed fears the country might miss the IMF payment of €200m payment on the 1st May and another for €745m 11 days later. This could lead to he EU member being forced, eventually, to leave the eurozone. The IMF debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended €240 billion in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (left) met with Mr. Thomsen who expressed worry over the Greek economy. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' (right) government has been talking with creditors since January . Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason. He said at a conference last week that Greece was 'not going to sign on the dotted line of anything you give us just to get the next loan tranche', 'At the very same time,' he added, 'we need to have a fiscal plan that makes sense. At the moment Greece is committed.' However,Greece's new left wing-led government which has been locked in strained negotiations with creditors since winning elections in January continues to hold its recent election victory over the international community. Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason .

"Mystery surrounds the sensational CCTV footage showing the gem thieves in the middle of their audacious £60million heist after it was suggested that the police had missed this crucial evidence. The Daily Mirror published sensational pictures of the Hatton Garden raiders 21 hours before Scotland Yard released them in a bid to appeal for information about identities of the thieves. The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted', according to a report today in its sister title The Sunday Mirror, with an apparent source saying it 'blows the case wide open'. But yesterday afternoon detectives insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'. Pictured: The Met has released images of three of the gang which broke into Hatton Garden over the Easter weekend - but has only done so after the shots were revealed by the Daily Mirror . Audacious: Exactly why the police did not release the images beforehand is unclear - especially as the tabloid's sister paper The Sunday Mirror claims they are the key to 'cracking the case wide open' This is in stark contrast with the response given to MailOnline hours before, when police refused to say whether they had the footage. The Met finally released the pictures late on Saturday afternoon, while The Mirror could sell the images to a number of other national titles, including this website. Up until that point, no other newspaper was able to help the police trace the culprits of what could be the biggest ever robbery in Britain. It raises questions about why the police chose to keep them to themselves - or whether they even had the footage. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme this morning, former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said: 'I've never heard of anything like this. 'I'm not blaming The Mirror, but I am pointing some quite accusing fingers at the police for not finding it themselves.' Questions: Former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said he had 'never heard of anything like' a newspaper getting such crucial footage before the police got their hands on it - although police now say they had it . It is likely to put further pressure on an investigation which has already been accused of a number of failings. Owners of the security deposit boxes are continuing to demand answers on why police failed to respond to the alarm when it first went off over the long weekend. And now the MailOnline has revealed some have resorted to bribing security guards, as they desperately try to find out information about what has been lost. The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The CCTV will have gone some way to answering questions for those who lost thousands of pounds in the theft. It reveals how the raiders entered the building by a side door on Thursday evening, minutes after staff left the premises. They then entered the basement through the lift shaft, and broke

"One of Australia's most popular pain killers has been left with a splitting headache, as the national consumer watchdog gets ready to take it to court. Reckitt Benckiser, the company behind Nurofen in Australia, will square off against the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in federal court this month over claims that it has mislead customers. The ACCC will dispute claims made by the company that the Nurofen Specific Pain Range is specially designed to target different types of pain. The consumer watchdog claims that all products contain identical ingredients. Scroll down for video . Australia's consumer watchdog is taking Nurofen to court over its advertising claiming its products target specific types of pain . The products in question are: Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache. ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said cracking down on false advertising surrounding medical products was a targetted priority for the watchdog. 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' Mr Sims said. 'In this case, we allege that consumers have been misled into purchasing Nurofen Specific Pain Products under the belief that each product is specifically designed for and effective in treating a particular type of pain, when this is not the case.' 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' chairman Rod Sims said. It also flagged the 'significantly' higher cost of Nurofen compared to other products as a concern, with the range in question costing up to twice as much as a standard pain killer sold by Nurofen or another comparable brand. A Nurofen spokeswoman denied the allegations in a statement, and said pain-specific products made life easier for customers. 'Nurofen is committed to the quality use of medicines and promoting and protecting the health of Australians,' the statement read. 'Nurofen works closely with all regulatory bodies to ensure high standards compliance to guidelines. 'Nurofen will continue to work with regulators to ensure its packaging continues to be fully aligned with all guidelines and requirements and still offer consumers with clear pain relief options for their pain type.' The ACCC is seeking declarations, injunctions, an order for the publication of corrective notices, penalties and costs. The matter is listed for a case management conference in the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney on March 31.

"Police arrested former Premier League footballer Calum Davenport for allegedly assaulting one of his own team-mates after a local league match in Bedfordshire. Davenport, 32, a former England Under 21 defender who played for West Ham, has been bailed by officers after a man in his 30s received head injuries in the away changing room at Cranfield United. Both men were playing for Elstow Abbey FC and Davenport had been sent off. Calum Davenport (pictured here in 2009) was arrested for allegedly assaulting his team-mate . Davenport was arrested after playing for Elstow Abbey at Cranfield United (ground pictured above) Village football club Elstow play in Division 1 of the Bedfordshire County Football League . His Premier League career ended in August 2009 when he was stabbed in the legs by his sister's boyfriend. Ed Frost, chairman of Cranfield United told the Bedfordshire on Sunday: 'The incident occurred in the away changing room between away players, it was isolated there and didn't spill over into the club house. 'This followed a tense game between two teams at the top of the table, in which Mr Davenport was sent off in the latter stages.' An ambulance spokeswoman said: 'The East of England Ambulance Service Trust was called to an incident on Crawley Road at 3.32pm on Saturday, March 14. Davenport had spells at West Ham and Tottenham but struggled to hold down a first-team place at either club . 'An ambulance was called to a man in his 30s with a suspected head injury and who was taken unwell. He was taken to Bedford Hospital for further care.' Bedfordshire Police have bailed Davenport until April 17. The defender started his career at Coventry before joining Tottenham for £1.3million but he only made 20 appearances over three years and spent time on loan at West Ham, Southampton and Norwich. Davenport joined the Hammers permanently in 2007 but was again farmed out on loan, to Watford and Sunderland. He spent two years with United Counties team Wootton Blue Cross in a bid to regain fitness ahead of a return to the senior game which never transpired. In 2009, Davenport was charged with assaulting his sister during an incident in which he was stabbed in both legs. He was later cleared of all charges.

"Mexicans take it literally when they amp themselves up for a night out in their country's capital. A drinking game popular in Mexico City takes shock-factor to the extreme as friends affirm their macho status by competing over who can handle the most electricity, and they connect themselves to a live current. Known as 'toques' - Spanish for 'touches' - the game has seen a recent surge in popularity through the city, and has seen players' nights-out cut short by urgent visits to the emergency room. 'The drunker people get, the more voltage they can generally handle,' says Javier Rodriguez, who has worked the lively Condesa neighbourhood of Mexico City for the past 35 years. Scroll down for video . Electricuting: Javier Rodriguez has been offering drinkers the chance to play 'toques' for 35 years . Painful: It requires a player to withstand as many volts of electricity coursing through their body as possible . Cheap thrills: People pay £1.50 for a round, and Javier can expect to make more than £300 in a weekend . 'I've seen party-goers pass out after passing 100 volts, although it usually has something to do with what they've been drinking.' 'It's fun,' said Leonardo Flores, who eagerly took up the challenge when Javier passed by clicking the metal handles to make the sound known throughout the capital as a toques vendor. 'It gives you a jolt and you feel good afterwards,' he told the MailOnline, who watched as he withstood 85 volts of electricity passing up his left arm and then down his right. 'People also say it makes hangovers less painful, but that hasn't ever been my experience.' Javier walks a circuit of the bars and restaurants in the trendy party district from 3pm until the early hours of the morning, clicking together the metal handles that players hold onto to complete the electric circuit, which can reach up to 120 volts. UK mains supply runs at around 240 volts. 'It's a long-standing tradition here in Mexico,' he said. 'I've been hired to offer the game at private events: weddings, funerals, Sweet 16 birthday parties, town fairs, political dinners, pretty much everything. 'It's become part of our country's drinking culture. Wherever Mexicans are drinking in large numbers, you can be certain someone is going around offering the electrocution game.' 'Fun': Despite pictures suggesting the contrary, some people claim they enjoy the sensation . Device: The two handles send volts of electricity through the player's body, starting off at just 20 volts . Secret cure: It is also claimed a game of toques can make your hangover less severe in the morning . Each round costs £1.50, and Javier can expect to make more than £300 on a lively weekend in Condesa, one of Mexico City's most popular nightlife districts. Good business, given that that Mexican minimum wage stands at under £150 a month, and that his only expenses are eight AA batteries every three or so weeks. He claims Mexicans are always his best clients, and that not only are international visitors less likely

"Middlesbrough bounced back from defeat to Watford with a convincing 2-0 win over struggling Rotherham United. After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table. Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday . Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79), Forshaw, Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85), Bamford, Garcia Martinez.

Booked: Arnason, Frecklington . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 19,537 . After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved

"As the election race hots up, Labour leader Ed Miliband is getting a small taste of what it might be like to be a member of One Direction. A group of female fans, who've dubbed themselves the 'Milifans', are rallying support for the opposition leader on social media using the Twitter hashtag #milifandom. The largely teenage fanbase have spent the days running up to the May 7th election posting tweets of affection for the politician. Led by Twitter user @twcuddleston, an AS Levels student by the name of Abby, the unlikely fan club has prompted hundreds of tweets from fellow users who share their admiration for the Labour leader. My heart belongs to Ed! The Labour leader (pictured in Manchester yesterday) has been the subject of a social media storm in recent days as a group of fans, mainly teenagers, have posted their affection for him under the #milifandom hashtag . Behind the #Milifandom hashtag is @twcuddleston, an AS Level student who appears to be a genuine Labour supporter. Her tweets in support of Ed have led to lots of other women posting tweets of affection for him . Fearing a gaffe, the Labour leader has remained tight-lipped on what he makes of the Milifans but did tweet back the teen behind it, @twcuddleston . In her Twitter profile, she describes herself as 'leader of the Milifandom, a movement against the distorted media portrayal of Ed.' And even she is amazed at just how the hashtag has taken off, saying 'There are those in the milifandom, those who find the milifandom funny, and those who wonder how the hell Ed Miliband has a fandom.' Perhaps fearing a gaffe, the Labour leader has remained tight-lipped on what he makes of the Milifans but did tweet the teen behind it, @twcuddleston, saying 'Hi Abby - Delighted that you've joined Labour - welcome.' While Abby seems to be a genuine Labour supporter and a level-headed teen - she's declined giving interviews in favour of revising for her upcoming exams, others seem to be more preoccupied with Miliband's physical appearance than his abilities to run the country. One user @Helen121 defended criticism of Miliband, saying he's 'not ""mouldy"", he's hot!' Another, @helenamelia_xox, said 'If I ever met ed miliband I actually would cry he's so hot.'

"(CNN)There is always champagne at these things, but this art opening is an actual party. Purple light bounces off the white walls in the massive foyer of London's Royal Academy; punk music falls down the stairs and Kenneth Anger's homo-erotic biker short Scorpio Rising is playing on a TV screen. Jarvis Cocker is here, and so are Bob Geldof and Rupert Everett. There are the requisite grey ladies in fur and chapeaux, as well as twenty-somethings in backpacks huddled in groups, downing their drinks before walking into Pace London's booze-free exhibition space for the opening of A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense: A Portrait of Robert Fraser. While his name may ring few bells outside of the seasoned London art community, eminent gallerist Robert Fraser, who ran a gallery in London during the Sixties and again in the Eighties, was a seminal part of the Swinging Sixties scene. His notoriety hinged on scandal, parties and friendships with the most famous rock stars of the era, as well as an undeniable talent for spotting art's Next Big Thing. This is the eminent dealer who sold art to Paul McCartney, and hosted John Lennon and Yoko Ono's first joint exhibition; the Savile Row-clad Etonian whose Mayfair galleries attracted the likes of Marlon Brando, Marianne Faithfull and William Burroughs in the 60s and 80s; the silver-tongued heroin addict who introduced Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat to Britain, and was arrested -- and, in his case, imprisoned -- for drug possession with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards during the 1967 Redlands Bust. Curated by the artist Brian Clarke, A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense -- a winking reference to the police report describing the bust -- aims to blend the rebel, the art connoisseur and the hedonist to present a rounded image of an unsung star of the 60s. ""There are oceans of anecdotes by Robert, and some of them are true. But the anecdote isn't enough to convey the kind of energy that he had, this kind of magnetic energy that drew you to him -- or repelled you depending on your own energy,"" says Clarke, arguably the world's most well known stained glass artist. I first met Clarke three weeks before the opening at his spacious cottage-cum-mansion in London's tony Notting Hill neighborhood. A literal portrait of Fraser painted by Basquiat hangs prominently in the living room, surrounded by works by Warhol, Francis Bacon and others. Clarke, who was a close friend of Fraser's and was the first artist exhibited at his 80s gallery, is still finalizing the exhibition selection, but his energy is easy, if a little manic. Harriet Vyner, a long-time friend of Clarke and Fraser, and author of the Fraser biography Groovy Bob: The Life and Times of Robert Fraser, has been collaborating with him on the catalog. She's on hand to add her own anecdotes to the ocean. ""I remember going to Seditionaries, (Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's 70s punk shop) on the King's Road, and it felt a bit scary, but that was part of the thrill,"" she says.

"This is the chilling message a mother wrote on Facebook a day after allegedly abandoning her quadriplegic 21-year-old son in the Pennsylvania woods with just a blanket and a bible. 'I'm so happy,' Nyia Parler, 41, commented under a new picture of her cuddling her boyfriend on Tuesday. Just 24 hours earlier, police say she wheeled her care-dependent son into a park near their home in south west Philadelphia and left him there, before going to stay with her partner in Maryland. Relatives, who had been contacted by the boy's school when he didn't turn up to class on Tuesday, commented on Parler's picture, 'nyia call me asap,' and 'How the hell you happy?!? Call me!' On Sunday police said that Parler will be arrested as soon as she is released from hospital herself. Parler was admitted to a Maryland facility on Sunday for an 'undisclosed condition' and faces charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangering, neglect of a care-dependent person, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, according to police in Pennsylvania. 'When her treatment is completed, we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition,' Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police said in a statement. Chilling: This is the message Nyia Parler wrote on Facebook hours after she allegedly left her quadriplegic son alone in woodland with just a blanket and a bible. Relatives contacted by the boy's school frantically replied . Charged: Parler (right) was detained in Maryland on Saturday night, charged with assault and neglect. Police say she left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left) in Montgomery County, Maryland . Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found here on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . Parler left her son — who also has cerebral palsy — lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair while she left town on a romantic getaway with her new boyfriend, John Ferguson, police said. He was found on Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park. Police believe he had been there for five days and the last time he and his mother were seen together was on Easter Sunday. She then boarded a bus to bisit Ferguson in Maryland, said Lt. John Walker of the Southwest Detectives Division. Walker said the victim was found around the corner from their home, and he described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place: 'She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area, takes him out of wheelchair, lays him on the ground, puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him, and then just walks away.' During the period he was exposed to the elements, the young man was 'completely defenseless' in an area with wild animals, with no water and in cold, damp weather, Walker said. 'It's only by the grace of God that he survived this. Amazing,' he

"Ronny Deila will use international week to scout for Celtic signings but he and his spies are more likely to be spotted at Under-21 or national youth team games than a Euro 2016 qualifier over the next 10 days. Deila wants his club to gain a standing in world football on a par with Ajax for their development and production of young talent. That, he says, will enable Celtic to tempt the elite young stars in European football to Scotland. The Celtic manager’s goal is to close out this season with a domestic Treble, then make the additions capable of helping the squad through the Champions League qualifying rounds. However, it is unlikely that Deila will be throwing a few million pounds to secure any eye-catching signing that would raise supporter expectations ahead of that late summer campaign. Ronny Deila (centre) wants to implement the same youth production standards as Ajax in the future . He explained: ‘We will bring in players but I think we will bring in younger players to build the next generation behind the current one. ‘If we are going to fight with the best clubs in Europe for the best 22-year-olds, then you can forget it. No chance. The only chance we have to get a world-class player is to go to 16/17-year-olds and say: “You will train with the first team”. ‘That’s our chance to get a player in. We have to find some very big talents that can be the best ones. The Celtic boss will use the international break as an opportunity to scout potential younger talent . Celtic have a great chance of completing a domestic treble and thrashed Dundee United once again . ‘We have to think younger and give them the chance to get in the squad and train with the best ones. ‘Ajax get it because they have an unbelievable reputation — and we have to build, over the years, a reputation. That if you come to Celtic, you see what is happening, you get sold to the big clubs and you get a good development.’ Deila helped Real Madrid wonder kid Martin Odegaard on to early stardom by handing him his first- team debut at 15 in Norway. While Celtic would not stand a chance of tempting him to Scotland when Spanish, German or English giants are scrapping for his signature, Deila believes less precocious talent than Odegaard can be mined then nurtured into better long-term prospects under him. ‘There are players there, maybe not at Odegaard level, but close,’ said Deila. ‘With a good development, they can be past Odegaard if he makes the wrong decisions and we make the right ones.’ Deila played a vital role in Martin Odegaard's rise to stardom when he was Stromsgodset manager .

"(CNN)A term used by President Barack Obama and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to characterize rioters has given new life to a debate over the word ""thug."" ""Of course it's not the right word, to call our children 'thugs,'"" Baltimore City Councilman Carl Stokes told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""These are children who have been set aside, marginalized, who have not been engaged by us. No, we don't have to call them thugs."" ""Just call them n-----s. Just call them n-----s,"" he said. ""No, we don't have to call them by names such as that."" The Rev. Jamal Bryant drew the same comparison Wednesday morning on CNN. The President and the mayor are wrong, he said. ""These are not thugs, these are upset and frustrated children."" ""It's amazing. You don't call six police officers who kill a man without probable cause 'thugs,' but children who are frustrated and don't have an outlet, you call them 'thugs.' 'Thugs' is the 21st century word for the n-word. And it is repulsive and it is offensive to every person who is a parent trying to raise children interpreting what's taking place in this hour."" The recent unrest in Baltimore was sparked by the arrest and death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in custody. Six officers have been suspended over the incident. Bryant delivered the eulogy at Gray's funeral. What we know, don't know about Freddie Gray's death . Mayor Rawlings-Blake responded Wednesday. ""I wanted to clarify my comments on 'thugs,'"" she wrote Wednesday on Twitter. ""When you speak out of frustration and anger, one can say things in a way that you don't mean."" She added, ""That night we saw misguided young people who need to be held accountable, but who also need support. And my comments then didn't convey that."" Kweisi Mfume, Baltimore native and former president of the NAACP, said, ""It's important we not shift the focus into something that has absolutely nothing to do with poverty, despair, hunger, homelessness and a sense of not belonging."" ""Whether we call them a thug, a law breaker, a juvenile delinquent, it really doesn't matter. What matters is how do we take back our streets. And that's what men have been doing, going around, talking to these young men where they, are in their face, and letting them know, you can't control this community. It is not yours. You can't burn it down. You can't force people out. You can't threaten people,"" he told ""OutFront."" ""So I understand that, that people want to talk about a word. But I'm more worried about a movement, and it's not necessarily a movement for positive change. It's a movement for negative change right now unless we get it under control."" Kevin Shird, another Baltimore native and author of ""Lessons of Redemption,"" said ""thug"" is ""not like the n-word in my mind."" But, he said in a CNN interview, the term has ""been racialized across America, so I can see why people would become offended like that."" Shird, a former drug dealer, also said he

"(CNN)The Arizona police officer who intentionally slammed his car into an armed suspect previously faced an excessive force lawsuit in New York, according to court documents. Officer Michael Rapiejko was with the New York Police Department from 2003 to 2006. Two years after he left, he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that Rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest. The lawsuit said Luis Colon had parked his car and gotten out when Rapiejko, with his gun aimed at Colon, ordered him back into the car. During his arrest on charges of obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Colon alleged he was yanked from the car, handcuffed and choked. The charges against Colon were dropped six months later. Colon also sued two unnamed officers who arrived after the initial confrontation, court documents show. Colon and the city settled the suit for $20,000. The settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing . Rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006, and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the NYPD, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. The NYPD has said that it will not release further details about Rapiejko. Rapiejko's actions in Marana, Arizona, in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer, have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer for the February incident. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's ""New Day"" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. ""That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,"" Rozema said. ""So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,"" the chief added. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a nearby Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Rapiejko's camera shows the officer's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. ""We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,"" Rozema said. ""And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy

This season, he has made just 16 appearances in all competitions, scoring only twice and has been criticised for several underwhelming performances, in particular his showing against League One's Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Yet, the former Arsenal, Real Madrid and Manchester City hitman remains adamant that he will see out the remainder of his contract in north London. Adebayor's last Premier League goal for Spurs came during a 1-2 defeat by Newcastle back in October last year.

"Taken during the twilight hours, a British photographer has gone to extraordinary lengths to get the perfect shot including climbing rooftops, hanging from helicopters and even entering restricted military areas. And Paul Reiffer's dedication to his work has enabled him to put together a portfolio showcasing the beauty of some of the world's most famous cities by night. Each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails. Scroll down for video . City snapper, Paul Reiffer, 34, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes, including this of Tower Bridge in London . The winding bridges of Yanan East Interchange in Shanghai are portrayed beautifully in the collection . Reiffer, 34, from Weymouth, Dorset, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes and has visited some of the world's most iconic landmarks in the process. Whether it is the bright lights of the New York City skyline, the winding bridges of Shanghai, or the wispy reflections of Singapore's harbour, each of Paul's photographs reveal a beautiful side to the urban sprawl. By using a specially adapted camera that shoots at a whopping 80 mega pixels per image, the British photographer is able to capture huge city landscapes in extraordinary detail. Constantly on the move, Paul is continuously travelling in an effort to add new locations to his already impressive portfolio.

Paul said: 'Some of my images require a lot of planning, unfortunately, one of the ways I decided to get a different view was to get onto rooftops. 'Some with full permissions and authorised access, others less so. 'Ironically, while legitimate access takes a lot of bureaucracy, it's the more 'unofficial' shoots which take the most planning. 'Generally if you search online, or see a city in a magazine, the same old shots will appear time and time again, so while I use other images for reference, I tend to then start researching using tools like Google satellite view and 3D maps along with sunrise/sunset apps to plan my own take on the view of a city.

"A teacher who was suspended for allowing her class to write 'get well soon' letters to a convicted police killer claims the children wanted to send notes to him. Marilyn Zuniga sparked outrage for allowing her third grade class in Orange, New Jersey, to pen letters to murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal, after he collapsed in the bathroom of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. Abu-Jamal, 60, is serving a life sentence in prison after he shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in cold blood in 1981. Marilyn Zuniga apologised after she allowed her students to write to convicted police killer Mumia Abu-Jamal after he became ill while serving a life sentence in prison, but said the students wanted to write to him . Ms Zuniga has apologised for publicising the efforts of her pupils online, but said they had wanted to write to Abu-Jamal, according to philly.com. Both her pupils and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union wrote to the killer. Ms Zuniga spoke at the Orange school board after she was suspended from her position while officials investigate. She explained that she had previously asked her class to consider Abu-Jamal's quote 'So long as one just person is silenced, there is no justice.' She said when she told students the former Black Panther was ill, they had asked to write to him in prison. Ms Zuniga told the board she had made a mistake and was prepared to resign rather than be fired, to prevent damage to her career. Mumia's supporters say photos of the killer eleased this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is . Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . The letters caused many to criticize the actions of the teacher. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. He previously told Fox News: 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Abu Jamal was sentenced to life in prison after he shot Mr Faulkner in the back and then, once he was dead, in between the eyes. Abu-Jamal shot dead Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, shooting him at first in the back . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death for the killing, but this was overturned in 2012. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels which may be linked to diabetes. The killer's supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary.

"Two more games; that’s all it will take. Two more games and Jose Mourinho will have confirmed his mastery of the Premier League with a third title in five attempts at the trophy and Chelsea will be crowned champions. The clue that this was the decisive game was in the manic nature of the second half. Not on the pitch, but on the touchline. Mourinho and his assistant Rui Faria were up and down with unusual intensity, even for them, waving players back with the most extravagant gestures when they lost the ball. Hold on to this lead, was the implicit message, and a huge step will have been taken to the ultimate goal. In fact, as One Step Beyond played at the end of the game and the players congregated in the centre circle, there was a sense that the celebrations were already in swing.

"Reggie Bush will head back to his native California to fill the Frank Gore-sized hole in the 49ers backfield. The 30-year-old was cut by Detroit after two mixed years; the first inspired, the second injury-hit. ESPN first reported the deal after Bush opted not to join the New England Patriots. Concerns about fitness will plague the running back but when healthy he adds a threat on the ground and in the air. Reggie Bush trains with the Lions ahead of their game with the Atlanta Falcons in London last year . The 2005 Heisman Trophy winner was drafted second overall in the 2006 draft by the Saints. His five seasons in New Orleans yielded 33 touchdowns in 60 games and a Super Bowl victory. Bush moved to Miami Dolphins in 2011. He rushed for 2,072 yards, scoring 15 touchdowns over two seasons before joining the Lions in 2013. After going 8-8 and dispensing with Jim Harbaugh's services, the 49ers have undergone something of a facelift in the offseason. After a botched interview with Adam Gase, Jim Tomsula was promoted from defensive co-ordinator to head coach. And his short stint has seen the retirement of linebacker Patrick Willis, the loss of guard Mike Iupati to NFC West rivals Arizona and long-term staple Gore leave for Philadelphia. Cornerback Perrish Cox also departed to sign a bumper $15million three-year deal with Tennessee. The 49ers have added wide receiver Torrey Smith and defensive end Darnell Dockett and re-signed cornerback Chris Cook, as well as adding former rugby league sensation Jarryd Hayne to the roster.

"Aviva Premiership club Gloucester will face a Rugby Football Union hearing after selecting lock Mariano Galarza for their league game against Sale Sharks last month. The RFU has said Galarza should have been ineligible for the match. In a statement, the RFU said: 'In the Aviva Premiership rugby match against Sale Sharks on March 29, Gloucester Rugby breached Aviva Premiership Rugby regulation 3.3(a) by selecting a player (Mariano Galarza) who did not hold effective registration for Gloucester Rugby. Mariano Galarza played for Gloucester against Sale Sharks despite the fact that he's ineligible . 'The case will be heard by an independent panel of Jeremy Summers, Bonike Erinle and Robert Horner on Monday, April 27.' Galarza was selected among Gloucester's replacements for a game that they lost 23-6 at the A J Bell Stadium. He went on as a 54th-minute substitute for Tom Savage. Gloucester currently lie ninth in the Aviva Premiership, and it is feasible that they could be hit by a points deduction.

"New Delhi, India (CNN)Do not generalize India as a country of rapists. That was the firm message from the German ambassador in New Delhi after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male Indian student's application for an internship due to the South Asian nation's ""rape problem."" Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger never did such a thing, according to her and the University of Leipzig. The university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from India; while it wasn't clear how many of them were men, the university said 29 of its 44 Indian students total are male. Still, Beck-Sickinger has admitted making a mistake by engaging the rejected intern candidate with talk about rape in Indian society and how the issue spurred ""many (other) female professors in Germany (have) decided to no longer accept male Indian students for these reasons."" ""It was never my intention to make a defamatory comment about Indian society,"" she said, according to a statement posted on the website of the University of Leipzig. ""I do not have anything against Indian students -- on the contrary. I sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings I may have hurt."" Marital rape: Why is it legal in India? The firestorm began with a recent post on the social-networking site Quora. It featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the University of Leipzig's biochemistry department. They fell under this provocative headline: ""What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?"" The post didn't identify Beck-Sickinger, blacking out the name of the emails' author. But it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her: ""Unfortunately I don't accept any Indian male students for internships. We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in the group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support."" The thing is, Beck-Sickinger says she ""never wrote"" such a message, claiming this email was ""put together from individual segments taken from different mails."" ""I do not reject students because of reasons of race or gender, "" she added. ""I am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way."" Here's what the University of Leipzig says did happen: The professor told the candidate ""the laboratories are fully occupied."" The Indian applicant ""didn't accept"" this rejection, the university says, and went back-and-forth with Beck-Sickinger over email. During that exchange, Beck-Sickinger wrote things that she later regretted -- excerpts of which were posted to Quora and the university acknowledged as legitimate. Speaking about how Indian men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country, she said, ""I fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals. However it is also unbelievable that the Indian society is not able to solve this problem for many years now."" India bans rape documentary . Beck-Sickinger

"A firm which declared that the South of England harboured as much oil as the North Sea has been forced to backtrack on its ‘wild claims’. Last week, UK Oil & Gas Investments (UKOG) boasted it had discovered a ‘world class potential resource’ beneath the Home Counties. The oil exploration company claimed analysis of a well near Gatwick Airport suggested 100 billion barrels of oil lay beneath the Weald Basin, covering Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Kent. UK Oil & Gas Investments has backtracked on its claims the UK could be sitting on an oil reserve larger than what has been extracted from the North Sea and Kuwait. Above, the company's test oil well at Horse Hill . Sceptics immediately queried the bold claims – as the Daily Mail reported – but UKOG’s millionaire chairman David Lenigas insisted at the time that the oil would create thousands of jobs, saying: ‘If you own a farm or land in the Weald, there’s a pretty good chance there’s a bucket-load of oil under there.’ Now the firm has been forced into an embarrassing U-turn, admitting that it cannot be sure how much crude lies beneath the region – if, indeed, there is much at all. UKOG and a consortium of other oil firms hold a licence for just 55 square miles in Surrey and Sussex, a tiny fraction of the Weald Basin. But after finding oil in the area, it scaled up its findings across the whole 1,100-square mile Weald area. The company has now admitted that its estimates were based on findings made in a 55-square-mile stretch of the basin, less than two per cent of the total surface area . A map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the Weald Basin, which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground . It claimed the entire region was rich with the fossil fuel, sparking hopes it had uncovered ‘Britain’s Dallas’. Yesterday, after being instructed to give more details by the London Stock Exchange, it issued a ‘clarification’, admitting the oil should not yet be considered as ‘prospective resources or reserves’. It said further drilling and well testing was needed before it could say how much oil existed on its own site – let alone surrounding areas – and what could be recovered from the ground. David Lenigas has been criticised on the past for exaggerating his companies' successes to drive up share prices . Even then, it seems unlikely it could estimate how much lies beneath the whole region, adding: ‘The company has not undertaken work outside its licence areas sufficient to comment on the possible OIP (oil in place) in either the approximate 1,100 square miles or the whole of the Weald Basin.’ Brenda Pollack, of Friends of the Earth, said: ‘UKOG has backtracked on the wild claims it made last week and admitted that it has no idea how much oil is under the Sussex Weald. ‘This is yet another example of the potential for shale oil and gas being overhyped by an industry

"A terminally ill bride has been granted her dying wish of a dream wedding after being given just six weeks to live. Natalie Price, of Redditch, Worcestershire, planned her big day in just 20 days after being told her lung disease, which also claimed the life of her mother, was terminal on March 6. The mother-of-two, whose eight-year-old son Bradley has just been diagnosed with the same condition - fibrosing alveolitis - and her partner of 11 years, Andy, planned the wedding to ensure they had a fairy tale wedding.

Now the 30-year-old has just one more bucket list wish - to raise enough money to send her two sons, Callum, 11, and Bradley to Disneyland Florida after she dies to take their mind off the pain of losing their mum. Andy, 48, said he was determined that Natalie would have the dream wedding she always wanted. 'Natalie and I have been together for 11-years and we are soul mates. We'd always wanted to get married but we just never got round to planning it. Natalie's father, William Bradley, walks her down the aisle while the guests wait inside . The couple said they had always planned to marry after being together for 11 years . 'After ten months of regular scans and X-rays to monitor Natalie’s health we were told the devastating news that she had declined rapidly and had just six weeks to live. We knew from that moment we needed to act fast. 'Our wedding day was the best day of our lives, it was perfect in every way - I just wish I could have my wife for longer than just a few short weeks. 'It was mine and Natalie’s dream to get married and thanks to our family, friends Lisa Dorgan and Laurence Walsh, and local businesses, we were able to fulfil that wish before it was too late.

"A freshman basketball player with rare brain cancer who made it through full season despite being given only a few months to live is now having problems swallowing as her condition worsens. During her senior year of high school, Lauren Hill was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent. But she still made it through a full season at the Cincinnati university while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor she has. Scroll down for video . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19 (pictured), made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . Her mother Lisa updates her followers on her Facebook page about her daughter's progress and said this week that Lauren was having trouble swallowing, although her humor and bravery are shining through. She posted: 'Lauren sleeps about 12 hours a day and still does not like to take naps. 'Her appetite is not as big as it use to be. She has been having increased issues with swallowing. We had to add some thickener to her water to make it easier to swallow. Food we cut down into bite sizes these days to prevent chocking.' Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . She said her daughter's pain medication has been increased to help her deal with headaches and aches across her body. She added: 'She still has a sense of humor even if her legs give out and she falls. My favorite quote of the week.... ""I didn't fall, I gracefully assaulted the floor."" Got to love her.' Despite the diagnosis, Hill decided to attend college and play for the Division III school. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The Team: The Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team (pictured) held its postseason banquet in a hospital room with Hill . The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead

"Producers working on the remake of the Oscar-winning Ben Hur have been barred from shooting the epic chariot scene at the Circus Maximus. Filmmakers already on location in Rome and the southern city of Matera reportedly made a request to use the ancient stadium immortalised by the film in December. But it was feared the decision to bring hundreds of extras and heavy vehicles into a fragile archaeological site would lead to public outcry. The Circus Maximus (pictured) is an ancient site in Rome once used for the empire's deadly chariot races. Here it is pictured when it hosted the Live 8 concert in 2005 . The Circus Maximus was capable of holding hundreds of thousands of spectators during the chariot races . However, archaeologists said filming at the ancient site would cause 'irreparable damage' to the famous site . The rent of the ancient ground as a set for two weeks would have netted one million euros for the city’s cash-strapped coffers, Corriere della Sera reported. The classic chariot race scene - in which Ben Hur played by Charlton Heston competes against his nemesis Massala - will now be filmed in a purpose-built reproduction arena in Rome’s Cinecittà studios. The Circus Maximus was the centre of a row last summer when the Rolling Stones were allowed to use it for a concert. Heritage experts said the decision to allow 65,000 music fans to rampage over the area would cause irreparable damage to a ‘very fragile’ site. The millionaire rock band were charged just €8,000. The original 1959 Ben Hur film saw Charlton Heston filmed at the Circus Maximus in the movie's epic chariot race finale (pictured) The ancient arena has been used for pop concerts in the past with Genesis and Lady Gaga playing there in recent years. Bob Geldof's Live 8 concert was held there in 2005. But the site is currently under restoration. Archeologists have continued to discover Roman artefacts including ancient coins, wheels and saucepans as well as the remains of ancient taverns. A spokesman for the Ministry for Cultural Affairs said it was investigating.

"A Massachusetts police department was forced to pay a $500 Bitcoin ransom to hackers who encrypted vital records on their computer network. Tewksbury Police Department came under attack by criminals who infected their network with a form of Internet malware in December before demanding money to decrypt the files. The program called CryptoLocker infects through an e-mail and then scrambles the data on the computer. It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier. Tewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in Bitcoinransom . The only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the Boston Globe. 'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could. 'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort' The department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files. Police became aware of the malware infection the following day. Computers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan. It is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier. CryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. CryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. Computers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads. According to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. When a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency. After this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom. As Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach. 'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier. Tewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of

"Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women. According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to 'relax their vigilance over food', and to always 'remind' themselves: 'You don’t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.' Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website. Scroll down for video . Pseudo-science? Gwyneth Paltrow's (left) osteopath Vicky Vlachonis (right) has written a 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' guide for Goop, in which she encourages a laundry list of food restrictions . Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.' But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece – such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet – have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop’s advice. 'Although not as ""sexy"" as ""anti-inflammatory diets"" and ""magical cures"", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website’s top tips. And when it came to Ms Vlachonic’s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a ‘magical cure’ for morning sickness – while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation – Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims. 'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.' Glowing: In keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, Ms Vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid 'dairy, rich fatty meats, peanut butter, wheat and sugar'. Pictured, Ms Paltrow pregnant with her daughter Apple in 2004 . Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages. 'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber. 'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'. She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion

"Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called ""Princess."" ""Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot,"" said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. ""Nobody fills that boot now."" Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, ""a jolly soul,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: ""Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love."" ""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye,"" Pellegrini told the jury. ""And that is the very essence of terror."" Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. ""These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return,"" Pellegrini said. ""Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters."" Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. ""She traded that in for a bat,"" Campbell said. ""She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her."" By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately

"(CNN)North Korea accused Mexico of illegally holding one of its cargo ships Wednesday and demanded the release of the vessel and crew. The ship, the Mu Du Bong, was detained after it ran aground off the coast of Mexico in July. Mexico defended the move Wednesday, saying it followed proper protocol because the company that owns the ship, North Korea's Ocean Maritime Management company, has skirted United Nations sanctions. ""Because the company has avoided the sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council, the Mexican government is acting on the basis of its international obligations as a responsible U.N. member state,"" the Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations said. The Security Council blacklisted Ocean Maritime Management in July, saying it ""played a key role in arranging the shipment of concealed arms and related materiel"" on another ship, the Chong Chon Gang, which was detained by Panama in 2013. But An Myong Hun, North Korea's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said there was no reason to hold the Mu Du Bong and accused Mexico of violating the crew members' human rights by keeping them from their families. ""Mu Du Bong is a peaceful, merchant ship and it has not shipped any items prohibited by international laws or regulations,"" An told reporters at the United Nations headquarters Wednesday. ""And we have already paid full compensation to Mexican authorities according to its domestic laws."" According to Mexico's U.N. mission, the 33 North Korean nationals who make up the vessel's crew are free, staying at a hotel in the port city of Tuxpan and regularly visiting the ship to check on it. They will soon be sent back to North Korea with help from the country's embassy, Mexican authorities said. In the case of the Chong Chon Gang, Panamanian authorities found it was carrying undeclared weaponry from Cuba -- including MiG fighter jets, anti-aircraft systems and explosives -- buried under thousands of bags of sugar. Panama seized the cargo and held onto the ship and its crew for months. North Korea eventually agreed to pay a fine of $666,666 for the vessel's release. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

"Elvis Presley had one; so did Clark Gable. It was even the sedan of presidents. Then the name vanished amid an invasion of newer luxury cars from Europe and Asia. Now, the Lincoln Continental is back. Thirteen years after the last Continental rolled off the assembly line, Ford Motor Co. is resurrecting its storied nameplate. The new Continental debuts in concept form at this week's New York auto show. The production version of the full-size sedan goes on sale next year. Scroll down for video . Design: The emblem is illuminated along with the front headlamps on a Lincoln Continental concept car at the New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center on Monday . New look: The concept car being unveiled Monday in New York is painted a deep Prussian blue, a homage to Continentals of the 1950s and 1960s . Features: The driver's seat has a patented split cushion, so if the driver holds one leg out further than another, it will support each leg separately. The moonroof glass turns opaque with the touch of a button . All in the details: The Lincoln logo is seen on a passenger's side front wheel for the concept vehicle (left), and the Continental name also appears on the driver's side door (right) Gleaming: The emblem for a Lincoln Continental shines on the grill of Ford's concept car at the New York International Auto Show . Switch-up: The Continental is expected to replace the seven-year-old MKS, which currently sits atop Lincoln's car lineup . Luxury item: Both Elvis Presley and Clark Gable once owned Lincoln Continentals . Overseas appeal: In China, customers know the Continental name and appreciate brands with a rich history . After more than a decade of toying with alphabetical names like LS and MKS to be more like its foreign rivals, Ford's 98-year-old Lincoln brand is embracing its heritage. It's a measure of the growing confidence at Lincoln, which is finally turning around a decades-long sales decline. And it's a nod to the importance of China, where customers know the Continental name and appreciate brands with a rich history. Ford CEO Mark Fields says the Continental always represented the best of Lincoln. Resurrecting it sets higher expectations, both within the company and outside of it. 'When we get a chance to work on an iconic nameplate like that, it's a mixture of pride and a mixture of fear, because when you put that name out there, it's got to deliver,' Fields told The Associated Press in a recent interview.

"Passengers and crew faced mid-air panic on board an Air Europa charter flight after several travellers fainted while en route to Tel Aviv from Barcelona, according to reports. After landing at Ben Gurion Airport this morning passengers told Israeli media that flight attendants were 'hysterical', there was a strong smell of 'gas' in the cabin during the four-hour journey, and 10 people lost consciousness. One passenger told Israeli news website Ynet: ‘They did not let people get up in the bathroom because they were afraid more people would faint.’ Passengers told Israeli media that 10 people fainted during an Air Europa flight from Barcelona to Tel Aviv . In a statement, an Air Europa spokesperson said passengers were feeling dizzy, but did not faint, after noticing a smell that was believed to be kerosene, which powers the jet's engines. The spokesperson said: 'Around 6 people had temporary indisposition this morning travelling from Barcelona to Tel Aviv on flight Air Europa UX433. 'All of them have recovered quickly by drinking a cola drink. All passengers left the aircraft on their own at destination.' Almost 200 passengers and crew were on board the Boeing 737, leased from a company called Flying Carpet, when the situation unfolded. A passenger named Hilla told Ynet that people on board smelled 'gas' after the pilot started the engines while preparing for take-off in Barcelona. She said she complained to cabin crew but was told that everything was 'OK' and not to worry. An hour later, passengers began to lose consciousness, causing people on board to panic, she claimed. Over the plane’s tannoy a flight attendant reportedly asked if there was a doctor on board to assess the passengers. An Air Europa passenger said people splashed water on her to wake her up after she fainted (file photo) One woman who fainted regained consciousness after water was poured on her, but said she soon lost consciousness a second time after feeling dizzy. She told Ynet that she began to feel weak after the person sitting next to her adjusted the air conditioning control above their seat. The woman said: ‘[They] woke me up with water, and after a few minutes I passed out again. 'Stewards were under pressure … and [would] not even let us go to the bathroom.’ The Air Europa spokesperson said there is 'no gas of any type' on the new generation of Boeing 737 aircraft, so the smell perceived by some passengers came from jet fuel. The spokesperson said: ‘The smell of kerosene that some people perceived during flight is normal when the engines are started with headwind, but after short period of time that smell is always removed by the air conditioning system.’ The spokesperson said no emergency was declared and the flight landed as scheduled. An official from Israel's Ministry of Transport said Spanish authorities are investigating. A spokesman for Israel Airports Authority told MailOnline Travel that he was not made aware of any incident on board the plane. He said the flight crew did not say anything about ill passengers while communicating

"Ukip’s Suzanne Evans today said she will step in as party leader if Nigel Farage quits because of ill health. Mr Farage has revealed that he is suffering from a recurring spinal injury that means he is on medication and making twice weekly hospital visits. The Ukip leader has also pledged to be 'gone within 10 minutes' if he fails to win in Thanet South where he is standing to become an MP. Scroll down for video . Stepping into the breach: The party's deputy chairman Suzanne Evans (pictured right) said she would step in as leader if Mr Farage (left) is forced to pull out due to ill health. But she played down his medical problems . Asked what she would do if Mr Farage asked her to 'carry on the mantle', Miss Evans today told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'Well if he said that to me, of course I would, yes. 'But he’s going to win and I cannot wait to see him in the House of Commons, he will really shake things up, it is a very exciting prospect.' Miss Evans, who is the party's deputy chairman, down-played Mr Farage's medical problems. She added: 'His health is fine, his health is absolutely fine and whilst Nigel is leader he has my 100% support. 'He’s a great leader, look what he’s done for this party over 22 years, battered, bruised, physically, verbally, in all manner of ways. He is the man for the job.' In pain: Ukip leader Nigel Farage is suffering from a recurring spinal injury and is on medication . Miss Evans is seen as the party's rising star and has been increasingly tipped as Mr Farage's successor because of strong media performances. She wrote the party's general election manifesto. After the manifesto launch, she was praised for her assured and confident performance and she received Mr Farage’s personal thanks. In January she stepped in as policy chief after Tim Aker quit amid reports he was failing to deliver it on time. Miss Evans, who is a former BBC local radio journalist, works freelance as a PR and marketing consultant and in 2011 founded a health charity for women. In May 2013 she came to prominence when she defected from the Tories to Ukip with a group of councillors in Merton, south London, but she lost her seat in local election last year. She is regularly used by the party for appearances on programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight, and has been fronting the party’s election campaign morning press conferences. But despite increasing talk about her leadership potential, senior Ukip figures privately admit she is unlikely to be elected in Shrewsbury & Atcham, the Shropshire seat where she is standing to become MP. Mr Farage has said it would be difficult for his successor not to have a place in the Commons without the ‘potential for conflict’.

"Amid the horror of a Nazi concentration camp, liberated by the British Army 70 years ago this week, love blossomed against all the odds between an emaciated inmate and one of the soldiers sent to arrest her SS guards. But the love between British soldier, Sergeant Norman Turgel, 24 at the time, and teenage Polish girl Gena, 20, was only kindled because of the generosity and kindness of the camp's British commander Major Leonard Berney. This week survivors and liberators of the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp in northern Germany gathered to commemorate the day British soldiers entered its gates and began the task of saving as many of the 60,000 starving inmates as was possible. Gena and Norman were married two months short of their golden wedding anniversary of 50 years, pictured before his passing in 1995 . Norman Turgel pictured as a young soldier in the British Intelligence Corps in his early 20s (l) and Gena Turgel as a young girl (r) Gena, weighing only a few pounds was, like many others in the camp, a walking skeleton, for whom certain death was only days away. Among the recently dead was Dutch girl Anne Frank whose diaries while hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam became world renowned. But through the striped and filthy prison uniform, Sergeant Norman Turgel of the 53 Field Security section of British Intelligence Corps, spotted an eternal beauty and began talking to her. Before long Norman had fallen in love with the young Jewish girl who at last was being fed proper food and was being given clothes to wear again. Anne Frank, whose diaries of persecution at the hands of the Nazis became the defining account of the Holocaust, was just one of Bergen-Belsen's many victims. Frank was living in the Netherlands when the Nazis seized it in 1940, leaving them trapped. In 1942 they were forced into hiding in secret rooms hidden inside Otto Frank's office building. They spent two years there, but were anonymously betrayed and sent to the concentration camps. Anne, and her sister Margot, were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they died of typhus in February 1945, just months before the Allies liberated it. Bergen-Belsen's SS commandant, the cruel and tyrannical Joseph Kramer, was among those Norman helped to round up and capture. Other soldiers helped hand out fresh bread and fruit. Norman became so besotted with Gena that he told her he was going to marry her one day. But here the story could have ended had it not been for Major Leonard Berney, the new commanding officer of what became Belsen Camp for Displaced Persons. With Norman posted away and other prisoners being repatriated to all parts of Europe, there was a danger of the young lovers being parted forever. Major Leonard Berney, who is now 95, was the commanding officer of liberated Belsen. He played cupid for soldier Norman and Gena. Pictured in uniform (l) and more recently (r) Bergen Belsen was located in northern Germany, south-west of the town of Bergen itself. From 1941 ro 1945 almost 50,000 people were

"A hotel owner believes he has found the perfect solution for revitalising his flagging business - by converting it into a swingers' paradise. Jon Huxley, 46, hopes to cash in on the Fifty Shades of Grey effect and attract guests from the gay and swinging communities at his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent. He plans to install sex swings, bondage rooms and dungeons and have rooms of differing sizes to cater for couples and multiple groups. Jon Huxley, standing outside his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent, is looking at 'developing' his premises to cater for swingers . He hopes the craze in Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as his object of affection Anastasia Steele, can help transform his business. He said: 'We have plans to attract tourists from the gay and swinging community for short breaks and weekends of adult fun. 'Obviously a lot of equipment will need to be installed like swings, bondage rooms, red room of pain and dungeons of delight. 'We would be having these events each weekend and accepting tourist guests during the week. 'Food and drink will be provided as part of an all-inclusive hotel package and it would be a civilised and friendly environment.' Mr Huxley will be hoping to recreate scenes like this from the hit film Fifty Shades of Grey . Clothing will be optional and privacy for our guests will therefore need to be ensured. 'It is not intended to be a seedy or dirty business. It is a respected clientele who enjoy taking their clothes off.' Mr Huxley said he has decided to appeal to the swinging community after rowing with the council over the use of Grade-II listed building. Jon Huxley hopes the change in hotel ethos can see his business grow . For months he had been in a dispute with Shepway District Council over complaints about its use as a house of multiple occupation for homeless people. Councillors voted for an enforcement notice after neighbours complained of anti-social behaviour. Mr Huxley said the complaints had been about anti-social behaviour and noise from the street rather than from inside the property. He said he would not need a council entertainments licence because there would be no live entertainment, loud music or dancing. Asked what locals might think of his plans he said: 'I do not involve myself in what happens behind their closed doors and they should not involve themselves in what happens behind mine. 'I have bills to pay and the income has to come from somewhere. They have seen fit to take away my current source of guests so I have to look for other sources. 'I can't attract tourists because there isn't a market for it anymore and that is a fact I have to deal with. 'This is a growing market and I can't think of any other market that is growing at the rate of this one. 'Fifty Shades of Grey has been a phenomenal success and this is a sleeping giant in terms of

Aubrey said she was told he would be eligible when he is five years old . Aubrey, 29, a mother-of-two, said she is heartbroken because she believes her son should have the freedom to be independent, according to Fox News. The family submitted a claim for a wheelchair which was rejected in October. They resubmitted the claim which was also rejected a few weeks ago. On March 3, Aubrey wrote on Facebook that the claim had been denied. She wrote: 'I know that our son is only two but his mobility shouldn't be determined by a doctor that works for the insurance company, who has never met him. 'Crue is such an amazing and determined little boy and is capable of a lot more than they think. I don't know where he would be without his little ZipZac chair. That chair has given him his own independence and the ability to explore and learn on his own. 'He's been using that chair for almost two years now (no thanks to the insurance). I just wish that insurance companies would understand that if they gave young disabled children the chance to have mobility at a young age, the difference they'd be making in their lives. 'An able child learns to walk at the age of one so why is it not okay for a young disabled child to learn to use a chair at the age of two?' Crue, who was born with spina bifida, currently gets around in a $1,100 ZipZac, which is a small wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk (Crue pictured above in his ZipZac wheelchair) Anthem Blue Cross has said the child's doctor is at fault for not submitting the required documents ahead of the legal deadline.

"Gorkha, Nepal (CNN)The ride from Kathmandu to near the epicenter of Nepal's devastating earthquake is not for those who get easily carsick. Steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where Nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured, in much less than ideal circumstances. The view along the six-hour journey from the capital is deceptive. Although I see numerous landslides, I am surprised that the villages we are driving through are relatively unaffected. During the entire journey, I notice only about 10 collapsed or seriously damaged houses. One of the biggest challenges rescue workers are facing in Nepal is reaching affected people in remote mountainous areas. One of them is Gorkha, a district northwest of Kathmandu. The town we were visiting looks intact. Some houses have cracks, and I see a few collapsed brick walls. Most of the shops and businesses are open. But our first stop at the district hospital brings us into the full reality of the human catastrophe. The hospital campus is overflowing with patients. The facility is simply not big enough to handle such calamity. The injured are not from the town of Gorkha, which lies near the top of one of the numerous mountain ranges. They are from northern part of the district, where some 200,000 people live. To accommodate all the casualties, the hospital built a tarpaulin shelter over the parking lot. At a time of our arrival, there are about 20 patients lying on mattresses on a dusty concrete floor. The youngest is 10, the oldest in his 70s. Most of them have visible wounds: deep cuts, bruised faces, broken arms and legs or spinal injuries. All of their faces with empty looks are still expressing the terror they went through and the pain they are suffering. Mita Gurung, 10, sustained injuries to her face and leg when her house in the village of Sinjung partially collapsed. Her mother was injured in the tremor. Mita is gently tended by volunteer child counselor Tara May Bishakarma. ""I just found what she likes and keep repeating it. Her injuries are fairly superficial, but she is traumatized. It will take some time, but she will recover,"" Bishakarma says. Children usually get excited when being filmed. Mita seems almost unaware of my camera. Little food, less optimism in Kathmandu tent city . The situation in the hospital's emergency room is similar. Every bed is taken. All the injured are taken care of by attentive doctors and nurses. Some have family members with them. Despite the gravity of the situation, the atmosphere here is calm. Gorkha's hospital is ill-equipped to treat more serious injuries and serves mostly as a transit point. Here, the injured get necessary first aid and as soon as possible are transferred to bigger hospitals in other districts or in Kathmandu. There are not enough ambulances, and most of the injured must travel on old buses. People unable to walk are transported on makeshift wooden stretchers. I cannot even imagine traveling on the

"They had earned a trophy and a promising title shot, but there was an appropriate lack of rejoicing by England on Saturday night. Wastefulness is no cause for euphoria. The Calcutta Cup had been retained, but the limitations of the opposition meant that was never in real doubt, despite considerable Scottish tenacity and occasional artistry. Stuart Lancaster, his assistants and his squad know that the standards they reached at Twickenham will not suffice against the leading rugby nations. England beat Scotland but they haven't shown enough to convince yet during the Six Nations . Defeating Scotland earned Chris Robshaw and his men a trophy, but they didn't do enough . The England squad smile for the cameras having defeated Scotland 25-13 to win the Calcutta Cup . 1st minute: George Ford sends Luther Burrell clear but he ignores Anthony Watson in space on the right and the door slams shut. 13th minute: Ben Youngs frees Mike Brown but the full-back — minus a boot — is chased down by Stuart Hogg close to the posts. 15th minute: The pack drive a scrum towards the Scottish line but Billy Vunipola is unable to pick up and touch down. 17th minute: Jack Nowell storms clear with two team-mates on either side but goes it alone, slips and cannot offload the ball. 31st minute: Burrell bursts through and sends Watson scorching to the line, but the ‘try’ is ruled out ny Romain Poite for a forward pass. 54th minute: Rampant England swarm into the visitors’ 22 but the attempted offload by Geoff Parling is pinched by Blair Cowan. 56th minute: Replacement hooker Tom Youngs makes a dazzling midfield charge but it comes to nothing as his pass flies between two supporting runners. 58th minute: Watson breaks from a ruck to the opposition 22 but runs away from Burrell and cannot release the centre to score. 62nd minute: Brown blasts over the Scottish 22 to score, but the ‘try’ is disallowed due to another forward pass in the build-up — this time by James Haskell. While the Red Rose is now planted at the top of the RBS Six Nations table, even shambolic France may be no push-overs in the tournament finale at Twickenham next Saturday if there is not a sharp up-turn in English precision. ‘If you look at the All Blacks, when they create a line break they usually end up scoring,’ said Lancaster. ‘We created 12 line breaks, which is a huge positive because I haven’t seen any team pull Scotland apart like that, but to only come away with three tries is frustrating. I think the players know that.’ They most certainly do. Ben Youngs was named man of the match for his efforts at scrum half, but he appeared underwhelmed by the manner of the victory. ‘We got what we wanted in terms of the result, but the scoreline should have been better,’ he admitted. There is a recurring concern for England. Composure — or a lack of it. They mustered plenty in Cardiff to turn the tide against Wales, but

"Police say they have no objections to the late afternoon kick-off for Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford. With plenty at stake for both United and City – both sides are challenging for a top-four spot in the Premier League – some may feel that the 4pm start could be unwise as it allows supporters more time in the pub. However, the man in charge of patrolling the sell-out clash has no such fears. Police say they have no objections to Sunday's Manchester derby taking place in the late afternoon . Chief Superintendent John O'Hare says the kick-off was agreed by all parties and revealed that the decision is down to good behaviour from supporters of each side. 'We have not objected to the 4pm kick-off time at all,' he told Sportsmail. 'That 4pm has been agreed is testament to the excellent behaviour of the overwhelming majority of fans who have attended previous derby fixtures. 'It is the positive behaviour of both sets of fans at previous derby fixtures that means we feel confident this Sunday’s fixture will continue that tradition of the fixture being a safe and enjoyable one.' Rio Ferdinand was hit by an object thrown from the crowd during the Manchester derby in December 2012 . In February, Merseyside Police launched a legal challenge after the Everton v Liverpool match, which was also televised, was chosen for a 5.30pm start although they later withdrew their objection. Police in Manchester have met representatives from supporters groups representing each club and agreed a series of measures. Inside the ground fans in and close to the away end will be limited to two drinks every time they visit the bar. No street drinking will be allowed while police will also be searching supporters and keeping an eye out for pyrotechnics. GMP also say they have no intention to hold back City supporters at the final whistle but add that this could be reviewed on the day. Footage on You Tube showed the unrest when United played City in a late kick-off at Wembley in 2011 . City won that FA Cup semi-final, but 34 arrests were made due to crowd trouble outside the stadium . The last time United and City met in a late kick-off for a weekend match was in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in 2011. That clash, won by City 1-0, started at 5.15pm and was marred by a series of skirmishes on Wembley Way and on coach parks close to the stadium with 34 arrests made amid scenes some fans described as 'a free for all'. The last late afternoon kick-off in Manchester was for a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford in 2004. After November's derby at the Etihad Stadium, won 1-0 by City, video footage captured dozens of fans fighting outside a nearby pub around 90 minutes after the final whistle. In April 2012, Vincent Kompany's header settled the derby in a match that was played on a Monday night at the Etihad Stadium.

"Mert Tanay has been banned from driving for three years after he was caught speeding at 124mph on the M20 with his six-year-old son as passenger . A reckless father sped along a crowded motorway at 142mph as his six-year-old son sat terrified in the passenger seat. Mert Tanay weaved in and out of traffic in his powerful BMW 323 and even failed to realise he had sped past a police car that had been chasing another speeding vehicle on the M20 at Harrietsham, Kent. Police chased the 26-year-old for 10 miles to catch him and when he pulled over officers said his son looked terrified and was shaking in the passenger seat. Tanay had told police he was driving at such speed because he was 'distracted' thinking about his forthcoming wedding in six months time. The incident took place on September 28, Canterbury Crown Court heard. Tanay has been banned from driving for three years. He was eventually stopped by police after being seen speeding on the coastbound carriageway near Harrietsham. Alex Rooke, prosecuting, said: 'He was driving so fast as to be considered dangerous, well in excess of 100 miles per hour. 'According to the officer his speed was excessive on what was a crowded motorway. 'He showed little regard for the welfare of his passenger and other road users for a prolonged spell of driving.' At one point Tanay was clocked at 141.6 mph as he tore along the coastbound carriageway last September. Scroll down for video . He admitted dangerous driving and was banned for three years and ordered to carry out 50 hours unpaid work. Tanay, of Enfield, Middlesex, was also ordered to take an extended driving test to retain his licence by Judge Nigel van der Bijl . Defending Paul Hogben said: 'Thankfully there was no accident, injuries or damage but he is a man with a full-time job and is due to be married at the end of this month.' Police speed cameras captured Tanay speeding at 140mph as he tore past them in his powerful BMW . Kent Police have released a video of the chase as a warning to other motorists. Sergeant Chris Wade said: 'The speed and manner of Mert Tanay's driving in this case showed a complete disregard for the safety of other road users, not to mention that of his young passenger who looked very shaken by his experience. 'Tanay's actions on what is a busy motorway fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver. 'Educating drivers in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on Kent's roads is a vitally important part of our role.'

"Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck has pulled out of the England squad because of a knee injury he suffered in Friday's 4-0 win over Lithuania. Welbeck sustained the injury in the second half of the victory at Wembley and was replaced in the 77th minute. The Football Association confirmed on Saturday that Welbeck had been sent back to Arsenal. Danny Welbeck has been sent back to Arsenal after picking up a knee injury in England's win over Lithuania . Welbeck scored England's second in the 4-0 win but will not be present for the friendly against Italy in Turin . The striker will therefore not take part in Tuesday's friendly against Italy in Turin. The FA also confirmed Raheem Sterling, James Milner and Leighton Baines had been sent back to their clubs. Liverpool forward Sterling is carrying a toe injury and Manchester City midfielder Milner did not play against Lithuania as he had a knee problem. Baines has gone back to Everton as Roy Hodgson wants to give Kieran Gibbs his seventh cap in Turin. The England manager has called up Southampton's Ryan Bertrand as cover for the Arsenal defender. Raheem Sterling has also returned to his squad after carrying a toe injury against Lithuania on Friday . Manchester City midfielder James Milner has left and did not play against Lithuania as he has a knee problem . Leighton Baines has gone back to Everton as Roy Hodgson wants to give Kieran Gibbs a cap in Turin . Hodgson told FA TV: 'We knew we were going to be losing Raheem Sterling who had an injection last night on an on-going injury and hopefully that will help him as we go forward. 'We have a problem with James Milner who had to leave, we decided to let Leighton Baines go home and of course we lost Danny Welbeck who unfortunately picked up a slight knee injury (against Lithuania). 'So those four players won't be with us going forward but it means a chance for the other guys in the squad to show what they can do. 'We are going to bring Ryan Bertrand in because with Leighton Baines gone we are now left with only one recognised left-back which is Kieran Gibbs and we wanted two recognised left-backs for both games.' Ryan Bertrand (right) has been called up from Southampton as cover after Baines left Hodgson's squad . Nine players have withdrawn from the squad since it was announced. Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Fraser Forster and Danny Rose all pulled out through injury last week. That means Hodgson has just 17 outfield players to choose from for the game against the country that beat England in their World Cup opener in Manaus last June. Harry Kane scored against Lithuania but is one of just 17 fit outfield players for England to use against Italy .

"A new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases, it has emerged. An official source told The Associated Press that the U.S. Secret Service will conduct drone flights between 1am and 4am over the coming weeks in restricted airspace over Washington D.C. During missions, agents will look at how to interfere with rogue consumer-level drones, which commonly carry video cameras but are powerful enough to carry small amounts of explosives. The challenge for the Secret Service is quickly detecting a rogue drone flying near the White House or the president's location, then within moments either hacking it to seize control over its flight or jamming its signal to send it off course or make it crash. Growing trend: A new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases, it has emerged . The Secret Service has said only that it will openly test drones over Washington, but it declined to provide details such as when it will fly, how many drones, over what parts of the city, for how long and for what purposes. It decided to tell the public in advance about the tests out of concern that people who saw the drones might be alarmed, particularly in the wake of the drones spotted recently over Paris at night. Flying overnight also diminishes the chances that radio jamming would accidentally affect nearby businesses, drivers, pedestrians and tourists. It is illegal under the U.S. Communications Act to sell or use signal jammers except for narrow purposes by government agencies. Depending on a drone's manufacturer and capabilities, its flight-control and video-broadcasting systems commonly use the same common radio frequencies as popular Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies. Jamming by the Secret Service - depending on how powerfully or precisely it works - could disrupt nearby Internet networks or phone conversations until it's turned off. Testing in the real-world environment around the White House would reveal unexpected effects on jamming efforts from nearby buildings, monuments or tall trees. Signals emanating from an inbound drone - such as coming from a video stream back to its pilot - could allow the Secret Service to detect and track it. Federal agencies generally need approval to jam signals from the U.S. telecommunications advisory agency, the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Found: The recreational drone that landed on the White House South Lawn is seen in this U.S. Secret Service handout . That agency declined to tell the AP whether the Secret Service sought permission because it said such requests are not routinely made public. The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed it formally authorized the Secret Service to fly the drones and granted it a special waiver to fly them over Washington. The agency declined to provide specifics about the secret program. In January, a wayward quadcopter drone, piloted by an off-duty U.S. intelligence employee, landed on the White House lawn. At the time, the Secret Service said the errant landing appeared to be accidental and was

"Examining an ultrasound scan of your unborn child is a nerve-racking moment for most parents. But any worries that Ed and Dee Parsons may have harboured quickly faded when they saw their baby in the womb at 20 weeks. The child was making an unmistakable V-sign – the victory gesture associated with Winston Churchill and, latterly, with world peace. The baby formed a V symbol with its tiny fingers while in mother Dee Parson's womb during a scan . ‘The sonographer couldn't believe it – she said she had never seen anything like it before,’ said Mrs Parsons, 35. ‘It’s nice to have such an iconic image of peace when there’s so much unrest all around us. It was very reassuring. She said she and her husband, also 35, were feeling weighed down by negative global events and the death of someone close to them. ‘We were thinking, we’re bringing this child into the world at such a horrible time,’ she added. ‘But then this happened, we couldn’t quite believe what we were seeing. 'All our friends said they thought it was such a positive, happy symbol.’ The couple, who live in Godalming, Surrey, and run an event production business, are thinking of calling the baby Winston if it is a boy. ‘It’s growing on us,’ Mrs Parsons said. ‘But for now we are calling it peace-baby, that’s our nickname.’ Mrs Parsons, who has a daughter, Grace, six, from a previous marriage, said that in the 12-week scan the child had given a clear thumbs-up. Churchill is reported to have once said: ‘All babies look like me. But then, I look like all babies.’ Expectant parents Dee and Ed Parsons said the image was 'very reassuring' because the symbol is so 'happy'

Alexandre and Ronaldo Antunes had a special birthday party at the Tufts Medical Center on Thursday while gathered with the staff who helped their family during their births last March.

Dr Jonathan Davis (center), chief of Newborn Medicine at the hospital, said he had never seen delayed interval delivery this successful . Lindalva Pinheiro da Silva, the boys' mother, went into labor 16 weeks early last February and had a delayed interval delivery, which is rare.

'It looks like it was yesterday. It's unbelievable. Grateful to be here celebrating their first year.' Nurse JoAnn Loiselle said: 'To see them [Alexandre and Ronaldo] going from tiny and fighting for their lives to thriving with what looks like no deficits is almost a miracle. Dr Jonathan Davis, chief of Newborn Medicine at the hospital, said he had seen 'exceptionally rare' delivery attempted several times, but that it was never quite successful.

"The NFL has its first full-time female game official. Sarah Thomas, who has worked exhibition games, will be a line judge for the 2015 season, the league announced on Wednesday. The 41-year-old was in the league's officiating development program in 2013-14 and worked some team minicamps last year. She's already broken ground in the officiating field as the first woman to work college games in 2007. She was the first female official on the FBS level and the first to officiate a bowl game, the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl in Detroit. Sarah Thomas is the NFL's first full-time female referee and will be a line judge during the upcoming season . Thomas poses during the pre-season game between the Seahawks and the Chargers last year . 'I am a female, but I don't look at myself as just a female,' Thomas said last June while working a Cleveland Browns minicamp. 'I look at myself as an official.' Shannon Eastin worked regular-season NFL games in 2012 as a replacement official, making her the first female to do so in any capacity. She also was a line judge. Thomas, a former college basketball player, was inspired to become an official in the 1990s when she attended a meeting with her brother, Lea. In 1996, Thomas became the first female to officiate in a Division 1-A high school football game in Mississippi. Just under a decade later, she began officiating college games when she was hired by Conference USA, working as a line judge and head linesman. She also has worked the Senior Bowl, the Fight Hunger Bowl, the Medal of Honor Bowl, and the Conference USA Championship game in 2010 and 2014. Thomas officiated two seasons in the United Football League, which is now out of business. Off the field, she's a pharmaceutical representative. She said last June her two sons and one daughter see nothing extraordinary about her football job. 'They just know mom officiates and it's nothing foreign to them or pioneering or anything,' she said. 'I do this.'

"Celtic were on Friday standing by skipper Scott Brown after images of him slumped on the pavement and apparently drunk on a night out in Edinburgh emerged just days before Sunday's League Cup final. The pictures, published in a tabloid newspaper, were taken after the Scotland captain had allegedly spent Wednesday night drinking with friends in lap-dancing bars in the capital. Brown was also shown eating fast food in the photographs, flying in the face of manager Ronny Deila’s instructions to his players to be ‘24-hour athletes’. Celtic captain Scott Brown eats fast food while sat on the floor and apparently drunk . Brown is seen leaving Baby Dolls after being reportedly told by a bouncer to 'get some food and sober up' Brown tucks into a pizza after popping in to Kingfisher kebab and pizza shop . Celtic manager Ronny Deila has banned chips and fizzy drinks from the players’ menu since his arrival . The midfielder was described as being unsteady on his feet by witnesses in Edinburgh on Wednesday . Brown looks to be enjoying his food as he polishes off the pizza while still sitting on the floor . Celtic refused to comment on the reports but Sportsmail understands the Parkhead club are playing down the seriousness of the incident after Deila gave his squad Thursday off. Brown, who has made 42 appearances for his country and is just eight caps away from entering the SFA’s hall of Fame, returned to training on Friday ahead of Sunday’s clash with Dundee United at Hampden. The Scottish Sun reported that Brown was in the Burke and Hare nightclub where he enjoyed the attention of scantily-clad girls and offered to buy dances for fellow drinkers. But he was reported to have had an argument with some of the dancers and a barman had to intervene to calm the situation. Brown then left for the Western Bar where he was refused entry but was successful in getting into the nearby Baby Dolls lap-dancing bar. The Sun reports that Brown was told by a bouncer to 'get some food and sober up' and he went on to fall asleep during a dance.

'Jesse’s been in and out of hospital his whole life with his cystic fibrosis, and I remembered once taking a picture to post on Facebook and it lifting his spirits,' Heidi revealed. 'For the past two months Jesse has been getting increasingly frustrated with the amount of medication he has to take, and last Wednesday morning I had the brainwave to try the same trick. 'Jesse’s always loved attention, so he agreed, I posted it up on Facebook and YouTube, then his dad took him to school.'

It was only after putting their five-month-old son Rocco down for a morning nap just over an hour later that Heidi realised this time would be different. 'I was expecting ten or maybe 20 views and likes, but saw there were over 4,000,' she said. 'I remember staring at the my phone thinking there must be some mistake, so I called my husband Chris, and he was as shocked as me. 'I sat there crying at how amazing it was to have so much support from complete strangers. I spent most of that day personally thanking everyone who’d posted words of encouragement.' By the time Heidi picked up Jesse from Heath Primary School, they had more than 12,000 views. 'I told Jesse the news when we got home and screamed and dived on the sofa – he was hysterically happy, which brought tears to my eyes,' she says.

"As if he didn’t already know, Joe Schmidt found out the hard way last Saturday that 80 minutes can be a long time in rugby. Ireland were riding the crest of a wave arriving into Cardiff. Ten successive wins and the Grand Slam there for the taking. Eighty minutes later, their unbeaten run was over and now they face the very real prospect of being left with nothing to show for their efforts in 2015. A year ago they had momentum going into the closing round of the championship. They led the table with a huge points difference and, after England fell short of eclipsing that target in Rome, there were no outside complications weighing on Ireland’s mind in that evening’s tournament closer: beat France and the title was theirs. Jared Payne (left), Iain Henderson (centre) and Jordi Murphy warm-up during Ireland training on Thursday . Ireland flanker Sean O'Brien fires out a backhand pass during Ireland's session at their base in Carton House . Jonathan Sexton (centre) and his fellow Irish players are gearing up for their crunch clash against Scotland . Twelve months later they are in an awkward bind — second on points difference with no exact clarity on what type of win is needed to retain their title given that England will be last into action tomorrow. Adding to Ireland’s anxiety is their inability to get over the try line. Whereas 16 were scored in the title run in 2014 run, there have been just four in 320 minutes this term. Schmidt, though, claims not to be worried about the drought, adding that a level of tolerance must be shown towards the development of his new midfield combination now that Brian O’Driscoll has retired and Gordon D’Arcy has been omitted for the Six Nations. ‘The game is very fickle,’ he claimed after announcing a team to play Scotland showing two changes from Wales with Luke Fitzgerald and Cian Healy getting in ahead of Simon Zebo and Jack McGrath. ‘One week you might score three tries and the next week you might not get any and you might have played better in the second week but you just didn’t convert the opportunities. Ireland coach Joe Schmit will put his friendship with Scotland boss Vern Cotter to one side on Saturday . ‘One of the frustrations from last week is that we did create three really clear try-scoring opportunities that we didn’t convert. Last year, we converted a lot of our try-scoring opportunities. They are the very fine margins. ‘Trying to make sure we get on the right side of those margins all the time is difficult and it is something we’re working really hard on,’ claimed the attack coach whose specialist role in preparing the team is now under scrutiny as Ireland’s meagre try tally is the joint worst in the tournament, level with France and seven tries fewer than top scorers England. The lack of finishing power has cast a spotlight on the rookie centre pairing of Jared Payne and Robbie Henshaw. ‘Jared doesn’t have a lot of

"As the days countdown to Saturday’s NSW State Election, politicians are using every way they can to gain votes, and one of these is to advertise on gay hook-up app, Grindr. Labor’s Penny Sharpe, who is looking to become a member of the Legislative Assembly, and Sydney state independent MP Alex Greenwich are both using the app in a bid to get as many votes as possible. The two gay politicians are following up on the example set by Greens candidate Sam Hibbins who won a seat in Prahran in November’s Victorian state election. Labor’s Penny Sharpe (left) and Sydney state independent MP Alex Greenwich (right) are using the Grindr app to reach out to the electorate . Hibbins was one of Australia’s first politicians to use hook-up apps as a method to reach voters successfully. He used the Grindr app to send political messages to members of Melbourne’s Prahran electorate, living in the suburbs of Prahran, Windsor, South Yarra and St Kilda East, as the candidate campaigns ahead of the election. The Star Observer reports that Sharpe was using the app on a trial basis for this election. 'It’s not a space I play in regularly,' said Ms Sharpe, who is standing as Labor’s candidate in the inner west seat of Newtown. Ms Sharpe and Mr Greenwich both placed ads on Grindr to encourage people to vote for them . 'But I’m sure that some of my volunteers have profiles. 'For us, it’s a totally new way of talking to people and we know there are lots of people who aren’t as engaged.' Mr Greenwich also said that it was the first time that he had used the app to reach out to the electorate. But if it proved successful he wouldn’t rule out using other apps in the future. Ms Sharpe’s ads were paid for out of her campaign funds while Mr Greenwich’s is courtesy of campaign group Out For. Grindr is a smartphone app to facilitate casual sex for gay men . However, it was Mr Hibbins who was the original trailblazer. ‘This election we're using Grindr to reach voters in Prahran,' Mr Hibbins wrote on his Facebook page before the Victorian state election last November. 'We'll be using it to promote events, our support for equality and broader policies.' Mr Hibbins believed that although he was the first to use the strategy in Australia, the idea would take off as a popular campaign approach. Sam Hibbins used Grindr to send targeted messages to the homosexual community in his electorate in Prahan ahead of last November's state election in Victoria . Dutch and Irish politicians were the first to use Grindr to connect with voters. Dutch politician Jan-Bert Vroege used the app to campaign in March last year. He did not use pop up messages like Mr Hibbins however, rather transforming his own pre-existing Grindr account, changing his profile description to: ‘let’s have a date on March 19’ to promote a political event about gay issues. Last May, Irish politician Phil Prendergast used Grindr as part of her European

"Aitor Karanka hailed his two-goal star striker Patrick Bamford after Middlesbrough romped to a 4-1 victory at home to Ipswich. Bamford scored two outstanding second-half goals to ease the Teessiders to victory at the Riverside Stadium after a nervy opening half-hour. Boro gained an early lead through Daniel Ayala before Sky Bet Championship top scorer Daryl Murphy drew the Tractor Boys level. Patrick Bamford rounds Bartosz Bialkowski before scoring his side's third goal at the Riverside . Bamford reels away in celebration as he celebrates his goal against Ipswich Town in the lunchtime kick off . But Albert Adomah nudged Boro back into the lead before Bamford's brilliant brace. 'Patrick deserves those goals for his work rate and he showed great confidence in the way he took both of them,' said Karanka. 'It was massive to win, we needed a performance today and I thought we were brilliant against a good, strong team. Ipswich Town left-back Tyrone Mears runs with the ball as a tackle comes in from Adam Clayton . 'We've played against a very strong team who finished the game with four strikers and the main thing is that we're eight points ahead of them in seventh. 'To be eight points ahead of them is a good situation for us.' Boro's first two goals came from set plays, and the Spaniard added: 'We've been working on our set-pieces this week and it was brilliant how the first two goals came from them. 'We've put the points on the board in the early kick-off and that was important. 'Some of our performances of late have not been the best but today we did very well. Maybe some people expected us to be bad but we gave the perfect answer.' The scoreline arguably flattered Boro, who have won and lost three out of their last six games but went back to the top of the table before other fixtures on Saturday afternoon. Albert Adomah strikes for goal in the . Ipswich looked bright in the first half and hit the post with the score at 1-1. Town boss Mick McCarthy said: 'We worked on defending corners and conceded two goals from them. 'We were great in the first half and second half we were undone by a really good goal by Patrick Bamford, it's great play by him. 'I'll take responsibility after 3-1. I threw strikers on, we were all over the place and a bit of a shambles at the end. We're organised at corners normally and shouldn't concede. 'It looked a bit shambolic at the end as we pushed forward and I'll take responsibility for that. 'Automatic promotion is looking hard now, we're not going to win three more games than two or three teams between now and the end of the season.'

"(CNN)Early Thursday -- during the ongoing protests that continue to shake Ferguson, Missouri -- two police officers were shot. Such violence and lawlessness should never be tolerated. But the unrest during which it occurred demonstrates that the people of Ferguson have lost all confidence in their police department. And the resignation of the police chief this week won't be enough to restore faith in law and order. Everyone in the department needs to step down so the department can be rebuilt from the ground up. It is easy to see why. After a police officer shot Michael Brown, the U.S. Department of Justice conducted an investigation into the Ferguson Police Department. What investigators found was a ""pattern and practice"" of discrimination against African-Americans. In a town with a black population of 67%, black people represented 85% of vehicle searches, 90% of the traffic violations and 93% of the arrests. There is no way to justify this. Now, the Department of Justice has an opportunity to gut the Ferguson Police Department and rebuild it from scratch. In fact, it's more than an opportunity: It's a necessity. In the court of law, there is an old closing argument that goes like this: You sit down, pour yourself a bowl of stew and find that the first piece of meat that you taste is rancid. You don't put just that piece aside; you throw out the whole bowl. Lawyers use this story to say that if you catch a witness lying about one thing, then you can't believe anything they say. Unfortunately, it is an analogy that can be applied to the Ferguson Police Department. The Department of Justice report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department cannot be ignored, and the problems it reveals cannot be fixed from the inside. If there are a few good cops in the Ferguson Police Department, they need to leave, and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization. In fact, everyone in the Ferguson Police Department needs to leave, from the top to the bottom. The police department should be completely reconstituted under Department of Justice control in a manner that ensures that citizens of Ferguson receive the type of public service they pay for and deserve -- and more importantly, in a manner that protects their rights, not only as citizens of Ferguson, Missouri, but as constitutionally protected citizens of our country. A completely rebuilt Ferguson Police Department, established with a charter to enforce the law with equality, could serve as an example for every law enforcement agency in the country. A new Ferguson Police Department could show what a concerted, roots-up effort toward nonracist behavior in a police department can be. Under Justice Department leadership, the Ferguson Police Department could become a model for practices such as equipping all police with body cameras, community policing and better use of force training. If we can create from the ashes of the Ferguson Police Department a model that works, it may

"Rare: Riad Al Qassas told customs the £2m statue from Libya was from Turkey and worth £100,000 . A judge took a day out of court yesterday to visit the British Museum. But it wasn’t for an Easter holiday jolly around the exhibits. It was to help him rule in the case of an ancient statue which is said to have be smuggled out of war-torn Libya. The trial centres on a businessman who claimed in paper work that the treasure was a statue for home decoration. Experts, however say the Greek marble figure – which is thought to depict Persephone, goddess of the underworld – was looted from a world heritage site. While the man who had it delivered to a warehouse in West London claimed it was about 100 years old and worth around £75,000, they say it is worth £2million and dates from the third to first centuries BC. They claim it was intended for the lucrative private market in classical antiquities. Yesterday District Judge John Zani – accompanied by a gaggle of barristers and solicitors – went to inspect the statue at the British Museum, where it is being safeguarded in a basement till the conclusion of the case. Although the press were barred from the viewing, a video of it was later played in court which showed the judge circling the statue as marks were pointed out to him. He was told stains and other evidence meant it was ‘definitely’ excavated illegally from the ancient Greek colony of Cyrene – once known as the Athens of Africa. It is said to have been smuggled out of Libya via Dubai in 2011 before being discovered by UK customs officials two years later. Libya has been plagued by looting and cultural vandalism since the fall of Colonel Gaddaffi in 2011, with the resulting power vacuum effectively ending the state-sponsored preservation of the country’s multiple Greek and Roman sites. The sculpture is said to have originally served as a grave marker and displays unusual iconography including snake-like bracelets and a doll-type figurine. Jordanian national Riad Al Qassas – who is not in court – is accused of falsifying paperwork after he told customs that the sculpture came from Turkey. Dr Peter Higgs, curator of Greek sculpture at the museum, told the judge the statue was in ‘the top ten’ of its class. Caught in a lie: Experts at the British Museum, pictured, say the statue is worth £2million and dates from the third to first centuries BC . He said: ‘I believe the statue was definitely made in Libya, in Cyrenaica’, adding it was extremely rare. He added that his valuation of £2million had been made on 2011 prices, but said there were no directly comparable examples from auction house records. Andrew Bird, for HMRC, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court that academics had decided ‘on the balance of probabilities, this statue had been unlawfully excavated from a UNESCO world heritage site’. He said documents suggested Al Qassas had only a marginal role in the export, placing the blame with Hassan Fazeli,

"English cricket’s new bosses flexed their muscles when Paul Downton paid the price for a humiliating World Cup by being sacked as managing director. Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body’s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England’s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just ‘too accident prone’. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England’s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. ‘The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,’ said Harrison in an ECB statement. ‘The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.’ Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today’s board meeting at Lord’s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. ‘This doesn’t impact on Peter Moores’ position at all,’ Harrison said later on Sky. ‘This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.’ Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing .

"Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn was able to leave Melbourne with a smile, happy to see the end of what she described as one of the worst weeks of her career. The first five and a half days from last Monday were overshadowed by a legal battle in the Supreme Court of Victoria with former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde and his claim on a full-time race-seat for this season. That was eventually resolved on Saturday morning ahead of qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix, although further talks are planned this week - in a private arena away from the courtroom - between both sides in a bid to finally close the matter. Monisha Kaltenborn was happy to end a tough week with a smile on her face at the Australian Grand Prix . Sauber have been embroiled in a legal battle with their former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde (centre) Once Sauber and Kaltenborn were again able to concentrate on the racing, drivers Marcus Ericsson and rookie Felipe Nasr acquitted themselves well. Nasr was a superb fifth - the highest position by a Brazilian driver on debut - while Ericsson's eighth-place finish was the best result by a Swede since Stefan Johansson in the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix. When you consider Sauber endured the worst season in their history last year when they failed to score a point , their feats around Melbourne's Albert Park were all the more remarkable. 'It was a very nice ending to the weekend,' Kaltenborn said. 'The events of last week were not easy for the entire team. You can try to keep things away from them, but they are exposed to it. You just don't know how to shield it from them. On the track, Felipe Nasr finished fifth - the highest a Brazilian driver has ever finished on his debut . Kaltenborn (left) looks dejected as she attends a press conference of team principals in Melbourne last week . 'But it was impressive how the team continued to do their work, to remain focused and to bring home the kind of result we saw. 'For me personally, last week was probably one of my toughest in my time at Sauber, and I don't want to experience it again. 'I'm very glad it's over - all the more glad with the outcome (of the race) - and we focus now on the future.' Kaltenborn conceded on Friday the events of last week had resulted in 'a negative impact' on the team, but she felt confident that, given the tremendous result, it had now been restored. 'With what happened, the morale was affected, but you could feel they got themselves together,' Kaltenborn added. 'With these kind of results, you can have an extra push of motivation and you can feel good about it. 'This result tells people we're back, to forget about what happened last year, that it was a one-off and won't happen again.'

"Scientists say they have found a new dinosaur species which could have grown to 65ft tall – three times the height of a T-Rex. Nicknamed the Sibirosaurus, the creature would have been among the largest to roam the Earth 100 million years ago. It is thought to be related to the Titanosaurus which grew to 131ft long and weighed 90 tons - the equivalent of nine African elephants. Scientists say they have found a new dinosaur species, nicknamed the Sibirosaurus, which could have grown to 65ft tall. Pictured: a Brachiosaurus .

The news comes after experts in Russia discovered fossils in rocks on the banks of the Kiya River in Western Siberia in 2008. The rocks could not be removed so scientists from Tomsk State University extracted fragments from the sandstone for examination, The Siberian Times reported. Dr Stepan Ivantsov, a scientific researcher in the Laboratory of Mesozoic and Cenozoic Continental Ecosystems, said they originally believed the remains were of a very large herbivore. It took many years of research to discover it was an entirely new dinosaur. It is thought a dinosaur foot found at the same location in 1995 may also belong to the newly identified species. He told the newspaper: 'When we discovered this finding, it was only clear that the remains belonged to a very large herbivorous dinosaur from the sauropods group. It was the first scientifically described dinosaur from this group in Russia. 'Now after work on the extraction of all the remnants and the restoration (of the bones) are almost completed, we can confidently say that we have found a new species, and maybe even genus. Dr Stepan Ivantsov (pictured left) said they originally believed the remains were of a very large herbivore .

'If we talk about our discovery, this dinosaur lived in the Late Cretaceous period, that is about 100 million years ago.' Experts believe a dinosaur foot found at the same location in 1995 may also belong to the newly discovered species. Dr Ivantsov said: 'We constantly find the remains of dinosaurs on this site, near Shestakovo village. They fall down from the steep river bank regularly and we collect them.' Bones including part of a shoulder blade will be exhibited permanently in Paleontological Museum of Tomsk State University. They were named after the mythical Titans of Ancient Greece - giant deities of incredible strength. Titanosaurs have very long necks and whip-like tails, tiny heads and thick stumpy legs. They ate plants and were armoured with small bony plates along its back which helped protect them from predators. Titanosaurs were some of the biggest dinosaurs to ever walk the earth and weighed up to 90 tons. Pictured: fossil fragments .

"After carrying the Dallas Cowboys into the playoffs, DeMarco Murray will stay in the NFC East. But he will be suiting up in Philadelphia as a vital cog in Chip Kelly's offense. The NFL's Offensive Player of the Year is set to sign a five-year deal worth more than $40million, with more than $20m guaranteed, according to NFL.com's Albert Breer. Murray became the NFL's leading rusher thanks to a career-high number of carries (392) and working behind one of the best offensive lines in football. DeMarco Murray is set to join the Philadelphia Eagles after four seasons with the Cowboys . In a career-high year, Murray carried the Cowboys into the playoffs for the first time in five years . With rumours that veteran Evan Mathis is to be traded, the Eagles do have the youth or consistency in that position group. The 27-year-old had a career-high season with 1,845 yards and 13 touchdowns, but Dallas let him enter the free agent market. And it was Murray who initiated the meeting with the Eagles head coach Chip Kelly, ESPN report. Kiko Alonso (LB, from Buffalo) Byron Maxwell (CB, from Seattle) Walter Thurmond (CB, from New York Giants) Sam Bradford (QB, from St Louis) DeMarco Murray (RB, from Dallas) Ryan Mathews (RB, from San Diego) Expressing a desire to play in Kelly's fast-paced, spread offense, he spoke of his friendship with Sam Bradford, with whom he played at college in Oklahoma for two years. After joining from St Louis in the remarkable trade with Nick Foles, Bradford confirmed he played a part too. 'Absolutely. I've been trying my hardest,' Bradford said. 'I've called him. I've texted him. I've done everything. We've been in communication. If we can somehow land him, it would be a great pickup. Not only is he a great player, he's a great person. He's a really close friend of mine, too. I think he can really help this ball club.' The Eagles, who have had an eventful free agency, also announced the signing of fellow running back Ryan Mathews. The former San Diego Charger joins on a three-year, $11.5m contract, with a guaranteed $5m. With Darren Sproles already in situ, it gives Kelly a loaded backfield and the ability to use multiple backs.

"Britain's only surviving mobile cinema has gone on sale for £120,000 as the owners who spent years of their life restoring it and touring the country now want to enjoy parenthood. Emma Giffard, 36, and Ollie Halls, 37, from Somerset, bought the cinema for just £1,200 in 2005 and spent £35,000 on restoring the vintage classic with friends in Devon over five years. They toured the country with the classic bus which became a celebrity, starring alongside Melvyn Bragg in a 20-part BBC2 series 'The Reel History of Britain and in 'George Clarke's Amazing Spaces'. Restored: Britain's last-ever mobile cinema has been brought back to its former glory after film buffs found it rotting in a field in 2005 . But now the pair have decided the time has come to sell the bus, which has taken over their lives for more than a decade. 'We've got two children under three,' Emma said. 'Sometimes my mother-in-law comes along and looks after the kids on whatever event site we're on but it's getting to be too hard with the two of them getting bigger.' After years on the road, the couple had their first baby Iona May Giffard Halls in 2012 and five months ago, they're second arrived, Ivy. Since then, Ollie has had to spend five months a year on tour while Emma stays at home with the children and he's now looking forward to having more time with Iona and Ivy. Love affair: Emma and Ollie outside the Bedford cinema which has taken over their lives since they restored it ten years ago .

Happy families: Mum Emma with Iona May, left, and Ivy, right. The family have just bough they're first home in Somerset . 'I'll miss being on the road and that diversity but if I didn't give it up, I'd miss my children growing up and spending social time with them which is more important than the bus.' It's now listed on eBay for £120,000 which is 100 times what they originally bought it for, but it's not just a bus, it's a piece of British history, listed as 'the soul survivor' of the original fleet. It's one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967, to promote British industry as a global leader by visiting factories to show films about modernisation. With a plastic perspex bubble at the front and a Tardis-like interior with a 26-seater cinema inside, the Bedford SB3 looked like something from the future as they toured the country promoting the 'white heat of technology'.

"Trekking through the dunes of the Sahara in 40 degree heat can be thirsty work even for camels. And one for one of the animals taking a long swig from a beer bottle was just what they needed to refresh themselves. The herd of camels were on a trek across the Erg Chebbi dunes in Morocco, where one of the group was snapped having a refreshing drink. A camel takes a swig from a beer bottle on a short refreshment stop while trekking across the Sahara desert . Tour guides filled the beer bottles with water for the camels to drink as temperatures reached as high as 40 degrees . But rather than swigging down beer the bottles had actually been filled with water by the guides for the camels to drink. Photographer Joao Victor Bolan, who captured the image, said: 'The picture where a camel drinks from a bottle, it was obviously just for fun. It was just water. 'They don't usually drink too often and while we were there, I hadn't seen any camel drinking. 'We only made a short stop - I would say not more than 15 minutes - but judging by how fast they drank it, I guess they were thirsty.' Mr Bolan travelled over 370 miles across the High Atlas mountain range from the Moroccan city of Marrakech to reach the sand dunes. The pictures were snapped by photographer Joao Bolan, who spent time trekking across the Erg Chebbi dunes in Morocco . The 26-year-old travelled with a guide and a friend and when they reached the dunes, they hired a total of six camels to help them explore the area. And while there, they experienced extreme temperatures ranging from soaring heat during the day to freezing temperatures around minus five late at night. Mr Bolan, from Sao Paulo, Brazil added: 'I was photographing the route from Marrakech to Erg Chebbi through the High Atlas region. The group experienced extreme temperatures on their trek ranging from soaring hear during the day to freezing temperatures at night . 'We stopped at a base camp for the dunes where we spent the night. 'Like any other desert, it was incredibly hot during the day and cold at night. 'Riding the camels was a little uncomfortable to be honest. 'After two hours, your back really starts to hurt but I would say that was a nice experience because it's a huge animal that goes on a paced rhythm in a majestic environment.'

He said: 'We never in he world would have thought she was accessing what she was accessing on the school's equipment.' The third grade student was said to find the explicit images after circumnavigating the school's computer network which filters adult content . The email sent to parents by district officials said that all student computer use at the school is being suspended until a full investigation takes place. It read: 'Once staff members became aware of the situation, Information Technology technicians were immediately notified and all student computer use at Sunnycrest is suspended until our investigation is complete.

"A probe into how police handled child sexual exploitation in Rotherham is looking into allegations against 42 officers after complaints were sent to the force watchdog. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was already examining allegations against ten officers involved in the investigation into one of the country's most prolific child abuse rings. But today the commission said it had received 30 new complaints containing 100 allegations about 42 officers involved in the Rotherham investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is examining 100 allegations made against 42 officers from South Yorkshire Police who investigated child sex abuse in Rotherham (file image) The complaints came in the wake of the Jay Report, which described how 1,400 children, mainly girls, were routinely raped, trafficked and groomed in South Yorkshire between 1997 and 2013 . It said in a statement: 'The complaints contain more than 100 allegations against 42 named police officers, both retired and serving, as well as a number of allegations against officers whose identities are currently unknown.' The complaints followed on from the Jay Report, which described how at least 1,400 children were raped, trafficked and groomed in the South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013. The IPCC statement said: 'Work to establish the identity of the unknown officers and to identify any links between the different complaints and incidents is ongoing. 'The allegations range from neglect of duty by failing to adequately investigate on the basis of intelligence or to deal with incidents appropriately, inappropriate comments and suggestions of corrupt relationships between police officers and offenders.' The commission said it was also investigating an allegation that South Yorkshire Police failed to act on information passed to them in 2004 and 2006 about alleged child abuse in nearby Sheffield. This complaint relates to two named police officers who are now retired from the police service, the IPCC said. The Jay Report, published in August last year, sparked furious debate about the tragic crimes which took place in Rotherham, and how the perpetrators went unchallenged for so long. The Jay report found that the abuse went unchallenged as police and council chiefs were afraid of being labelled racist, as the perpetrators were largely gangs of Asian men . Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote the report, described how hundreds of vulnerable teenagers, mainly girls, were routinely exploited by gangs of mainly Asian men with impunity. Police and senior council officers were accused of failing to tackle the problem for fear of being seen as racist, and of ignoring or doubting the victim's accounts. A wave of high profile resignations followed and the National Crime Agency was brought in to investigate the crimes and how they were handled. The Jay Report was followed by another report by Louise Casey, which was scathing in its criticism of Rotherham Council and led to the replacement of the local authority's ruling cabinet with commissioners appointed by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. After more revelations about the scale of exploitation in neighbouring Sheffield, the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Alan Billings, last month called for a wide-ranging inspection of

"If you struggle to get your child to go to school in the morning, don’t blame them - it could be your fault. Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University. More than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research (stock image shown) Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia and the US. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non-shared-environment factors had the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact. Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact (stock image shown) A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures,’ said Professor Stephen Petrill, of Ohio State University. ‘It was surprising. The knee-jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student, or the child himself is responsible. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. ‘That doesn’t mean we don’t try to encourage and inspire students, but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different.’ The results don’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning, he added, but they suggest a complex process, involving many genes and gene-environment interactions that help influence a child’s motivation to learn. The study will be published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.

"Jailed: Dennis Scott, pictured outside Hull Crown Court on Friday, falsely claimed more than £23,000 . A 65-year-old man who claimed almost £24,000 in benefits despite having £88,000 in the bank has been jailed. Dennis Scott received thousands in pension credits between 2009 and 2014 by falsely claiming that he had less than £4,000 in capital. But a recent house sale meant the grandfather had significantly more money - making him ineligible for the credits, which are intended to guarantee pensioners a minimum income. He claimed the money had been destined for his grandchildren, saying he had wanted to give them a 'better start in life'. Scott, from Barnsholme, East Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to dishonestly making a false statement to the Department of Work and Pensions. He was jailed for eight months at Hull Crown Court on Friday. The court heard the £23,776.16 he falsely claimed had been repaid in full by July last year. Defending, Antony Farrell told the court that Scott was a family man who had wanted to give his grandchildren a better start in life than the one he had been given. Jailing him, Judge Richardson QC said Scott had behaved in a 'shameful fashion'. He said: 'It must be made very clear to you and to anyone like you who is tempted to defraud the state in respect of social security benefits that a prison sentence is likely to follow such conduct. 'Your flagrantly breached that system by your shameful conduct. For a man of your years you ought to know better.' He also noted that Scott had not pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.

"(CNN)As cheap oil and Western sanctions continue to batter Russia's economy, President Vladimir Putin slashed Kremlin salaries -- including his own -- by 10% Friday, according to state news service Tass. Government documents released in 2014 put Putin's annual salary at nearly 3.7 million rubles -- worth about $61,000 today thanks to soaring inflation. Putin's ruble reduction for his top ministers comes some two months after he canceled their holiday vacations, citing the same economic woes. ""The Government and its various structures cannot afford such extensive holidays, at least not this year,"" Putin told government ministers at the time. ""You know what I am talking about."" But it wasn't just top Cabinet members that would feel the pinch. ""President Putin also reduced the wages of Kremlin administration, government staff and the Chamber of Accounts by 10% as well,"" according to Tass.

"If you had £140,000 to splurge, would you splash out on an Aston Martin DB9 Volante or maybe even a three-bedroom detached house in Nottingham? Or, would you rather shell your hard-earned savings on a pink handbag? That is exactly what retailer Vestiaire Collective is hoping for, as they put a Hermes bag on sale for a cool £140,000 on their site. Is this Britain's most expensive handbag? A sade-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag embellished with rubies has gone on sale for £140,000 . So what do you get for your money? The made-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag comes embellished with rubies. The rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store and experts say it's an extremely good investment. Fanny Moizant, Vestiaire Collective's Brand Communications Director and Head of UK, said: 'Hermes Birkin bags have come to symbolise the epitome of quality, the materials and the impeccable French craftsmanship are second to none. 'The brand has a strong heritage with a controlled supply, which makes it highly desirable for stylish women. This aspirational identity has developed into a strong social status symbol. The limited supply and production of rare colours and skin have made these bags must-have collectors items resulting in an increased value over time, unlike cars, which are known to depreciate in value after leaving the showroom.' With the same amount of money that the handbag costs, you could splash out on an Aston Martin DB9 Volante . Whilst they don't own the exact same bag, Kim Kardashian, left, and Heidi Klum, right, are both the proud owners of pink Hermes Birkin bags . Hermes is one of the most coveted handbags of all time, but with a price tag of around £8,000 the Hermés Birkin bag isn't quite within every fashionista's price range (unless you're Victoria Beckham whose collection is worth a reported £1.5m). Prestigious luggage and accessories firm Hermés, who count many of the world's wealthiest women as fans, is known for luxury leather accessories. Renowned for its immaculate finish and top quality materials, Hermès claims never to use any assembly lines with one craftsperson making a single handbag at a time, hand-stitching individual pieces to create the finished product. The brand is rich in history, and some of its bestselling bags have intriguing stories behind them. The iconic Kelly bag, one of Hermes most popular styles, was originally known as the Sac à dépêches when it was developed by Hermes in 1935. In 1956, a photo of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, was pictured carrying the Sac à dépêches to hide her pregnancy. Photographs were sent all over the world and put on the cover of Life magazine. As a result, the bag became known as the Kelly and has been hugely popular ever since. Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian are big fans of Hermes ... handbag Victoria reportedly owns a collection worth £1.5m . The Birkin has similarly romantic roots, conceived as it was in honour of French star Jane Birkin. The Birkin was

"Theresa May initially rejected an application for the 32-year-old Taliban henchman to stay in the UK, but her decision was overturned by immigration judges . A Taliban henchman suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds. The 32-year-old, known only by the initials SAKA, admitted that his father was in charge of 65 Taliban troops, but claimed he only agreed to join the terrorist group because he was worried about his safety. He also claimed he had been tortured during four years in jail in Kandahar after being accused of killing a provincial governor’s son. The bodyguard escaped from prison and went into hiding, but claimed that he fled to Britain after Taliban fighters tried to track him down. The Afghan, whose identity has been kept secret by the courts, had an initial claim for sanctuary rejected by Home Secretary Theresa May. But in a controversial move, immigration judges have now thrown out her decision and given SAKA permission to stay because he was entitled to asylum and protection under human rights laws. It was ruled that deporting him to Afghanistan would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Experts said he would be ‘at risk of mistreatment and physical harm if he were arrested on account of being a suspected Taliban’. Court papers said: ‘During his time with the Taliban he saw a leader behead a man because he believed him to be a spy. After this incident his father decided to leave the Taliban. ‘Whilst crossing the desert the appellant and his father were arrested and placed in detention. The appellant was accused of killing MK, the son of the governor of Herat. ‘The appellant claims he then spent four years in Sarpoza prison in Kandahar and was never formally convicted or tried. ‘He claimed he was tortured and his head was covered and he was beaten.’ SAKA claimed he escaped from the prison and travelled with a Taliban member to his home in Kunduz. He said his father had been shot dead trying to flee the jail. At some point he arrived in the UK. The Home Office considered whether he had actually been convicted of murder and whether his presence in Britain ‘constituted a danger to the community’. Hearing the case in the Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, Judge Helen Rimington ruled that if SAKA were sent home the Taliban 'might also be informed of his return’ Lawyers for the department accepted he was a ‘low level member of the Taliban’. Hearing the case in the Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, Judge Helen Rimington ruled that if SAKA were sent home the Taliban 'might also be informed of his return’. He would also be at risk from the current Afghan government on the basis of his former membership of the Taliban, she said. Last night, a former British commander criticised the judgement and demanded a shake-up of human rights legislation so it

"Jerusalem (CNN)Within 48 hours of his election night victory, Benjamin Netanyahu rolled back his pre-election comments that there would be no Palestinian state if he were Prime Minister, but the damage may already have been done to relations with the two other major players in the negotiations: the United States and the Palestinians. In an interview with NBC, Netanyahu said, ""I haven't changed my policy, I never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. What has changed is the reality, Abu Mazen (nickhame of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas) the Palestinian leader refuses to recognize the Jewish state, and he's made a pact with Hamas that calls for the destruction of Israel. And every territory vacated these days in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces and we want that to change so we can realize the vision of real sustained peace. I don't want a one-state solution, I want a sustainable two-state solution."" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat says he believes the pre-election statement that Netanyahu will not allow a two-state solution. He says the Palestinians will keep pursuing statehood through the international arena instead of through negotiations. ""I've negotiated with them for 20 years, and I complained to the international community that there is a big difference between someone being a tough negotiator which is legitimate and someone being a non-negotiator,"" Erekat said. ""All Netanyahu needs to do to gain the credibility and the trust, not only of me but of the international community, he needs to stand tall and tell the Israeli people that in order to live in peace with our neighbors we're going to have to recognize the state of Palestine."" Erekat says the Palestinians may try again for recognition once more at the United Nations, a forum where they fell one vote short of recognition as a full UN member state in December. A new United Nations Security Council consisting of different member states may be more favorable to a second Palestinian bid. So where does that leave the United States? The White House said it would ""reassess"" the relationship between the United States and Israel. The broad relationship includes security cooperation, financial assistance, and strong diplomatic ties. Both leaders reaffirmed the strength of those ties in the weeks before the Israeli elections. But the United States has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to block resolutions unfavorable to Israel. Some of that protection could be at stake here as the White House urges both sides back to negotiations. The last peace talks, moderated by Secretary of State John Kerry, broke down in April 2014 after nine months of negotiations. As the talks deteriorated before the scheduled deadline, Israel withdrew from the negotiations when Fatah announced a reconciliation with Hamas, a militant Islamic group, and an intention to form a unity government. In a phone call with Netanyahu, President Barack Obama congratulated Netanyahu and stressed the importance of a two-state solution. But with so much skepticism

"(CNN)The American Pharmacists Association is discouraging its members from participating in executions. On Monday, the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy, stating that ""such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers."" This bolsters the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term ""drug"" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases. The group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection, said Michelle Spinnler, spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. That spotlight includes a January Supreme Court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in Oklahoma. This was prompted by Clayton Lockett's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack. In Georgia last month, the execution of female death row inmate Kelly Renee Gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy. Thirty-two sates allow capital punishment, and lethal injection is still the most common method. Last month, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available. Of the eight inmates currently on death row in Utah, three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad. Pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection. In Texas, the department of criminal justice told CNN in March they are running out of their supply. In July 2011, Lundbeck Inc., the manufacturer of pentobarbital, decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment. The companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose, so states then turned to compounded preparations, Spinnler said. ""Pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way."" she says. The new declaration by the American Pharmacists Association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology.

"Britons heading to Europe on holiday are facing the nightmare of arriving at their destination and not being able to hire a car, thanks to a controversial driving licence shake-up. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences. Information about penalty points for traffic violations such as speeding will be held only on the DVLA’s database, and will have to be checked online, by phone or by post. But motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist’s details. Scroll down for video . Changes: Britons heading to Europe on holiday are facing the nightmare of arriving at their destination and not being able to hire a car, thanks to a controversial driving licence (file picture) shake-up . Concerns: Motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist’s details . From June 8, holidaymakers heading abroad will have to log on to the DVLA website the day before and put in their driving licence number to obtain a special code to give to their car hire company when they arrive at the desk. But fears are growing that the ‘muddled’ introduction of the new rules will mean people could be turned away because many car hire firms abroad will still insist on examining the paper document to check for endorsements or bans. Furthermore, the passcode is valid for only 72 hours, meaning anyone hiring a car in the second week of their trip faces having to find an internet cafe or pay expensive roaming charges. Mark Bower, of the car hire insurance website MoneyMaxim, said holidaymakers could endure major problems at car hire desks across Europe. He added: ‘Most people are simply unaware that these changes are on the way – and it is not just renters. ‘I spoke to one big car hire firm in Portugal this week and they knew nothing of the changes. Six weeks away from implementation, the whole thing is very muddled. ‘It is another thing you have to remember to do just before departure. Or you can do it at the desk with your smartphone if you can remember the website address, don’t mind the data roaming charges, can remember your national insurance number and are impervious to the long queue developing behind you.’ The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences (file picture) Mr Bower also said unscrupulous firms might use the issue as ‘another excuse’ to persuade people to pay for extra insurance. Motorists will also be able to download their driving history as a printable PDF file, although it is unclear whether all car hire firms will accept that, or how drivers without access to a computer will cope. The DVLA insists the changes have been widely publicised. But consumers booking car hire for holidays after June have not

"Aaron Ramsey has scored 25 goals for Arsenal since the start of last season, none more vital than a dramatic extra-time winner in the FA Cup final. But his last one — the only goal of the game at Burnley — meant the world, because it was for someone special. ‘I’ve had a tough few weeks,’ said Ramsey, who pointed skywards after scoring at Turf Moor. ‘I’ve been on an emotional rollercoaster of late. My gran passed away a few weeks ago and she meant an awful lot to me. We had a great relationship and I’ve dedicated my last couple of goals to her. Aaron Ramsey celebrates his goal against Burnley by dedicating it to his late Gran who passed away . ‘Her name is Eileen. She’s on my Mum’s side and we used to call her Nanny Leany. She was 84. She was an incredible woman. ‘She lost her husband early in her life and raised seven kids on her own and in those days it was an incredibly difficult thing to do. She was always happy, making jokes and I had that sort of outlook on life. She always believed in me and gave me reassurances. It has been a difficult time.’ His grandmother would have been proud of young Aaron as he took time out from preparations for today’s FA Cup semi-final against Reading to pay his tribute to her.

She didn’t go to my games but I got her Sky to watch a few. She would always complain it was not on normal TV.’ Ramsey will be on ‘normal TV’ when the BBC screen today’s semi-final from Wembley, as he was last May when his 16th goal of a prolific season won the FA Cup and ended Arsenal’s nine-year wait for a trophy. ‘It was a great day and a great moment in my career,’ he said. ‘It was a relief as well.’ Ramsey points to the sky has the goalscorer is greeted by Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin at Turf Moor .

"(CNN)A court in Ivory Coast has sentenced former first lady Simone Gbagbo to 20 years in prison, the official AIP news agency said. Gbagbo was convicted Monday for her role in carrying out crimes against humanity following post-election violence in 2010 which left more than 3,000 people dead. Her husband, former president Laurent Gbagbo, is in the custody of the Hague-based International Criminal Court awaiting trial over similar charges. The charges stem from the aftermath of Gbagbo's husband's election defeat in 2010. Laurent Gbagbo, then the incumbent president, refused to step down after Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the election. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of the two sides, leaving thousands dead. In 2012, the ICC issued a warrant against her, alleging that as a member of the president's inner circle, his wife was an ""indirect co-perpetrator."" She attended meetings where plans were discussed and carried out to persecute Ouattara supporters, according to the warrant. Her husband surrendered to the ICC in December of that year, and is currently awaiting trial at The Hague on crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths. Both have denied the charges. But Ivory Coast refused to transfer Simone Gbago, saying it would try her in a domestic court instead. On Monday, it did. CNN's Faith Karimi contributed to this report.

She left the UK after it emerged her brother, who she has accused of abusing her when she was still a schoolgirl, has been re-arrested over further sex abuse claims by two other women. Karen Danczuk walks into Manchester Airport this morning as she heads off on a break with a friend . Mrs Danczuk flew away for a break three weeks after she first made the allegations public, before making a complaint to the police. A source said: 'Everything had become a bit much for her and she's decided to go away for a few days and just get out of the country.' Last month, Mrs Danczuk – who became well-known for posting revealing 'selfie' pictures of herself on Twitter – claimed she was raped by a family member ‘hundreds of times’ between the ages of six and 12. She did not name her attacker initially, but her brother, Michael Burke, was later arrested. Last week, the 36-year-old vehemently denied the claims, saying: ‘The allegations are false. I’m just so shocked and disgusted by it all.’ Mrs Danczuk, 31, has said she starting posting ‘selfies’ after feeling she can now ‘have fun without being ashamed of myself’. Mrs Danczuk has claimed a member of her family abused her when she was young. Her brother Michael Burke was later arrested but has denied any wrongdoing, saying he is 'shocked and disgusted' by the claims .

"At nine months old, babies, if they are really advanced, might be crawling around on the floor, or shuffling from A to B. However, this tiny tot has been filmed surfing - as his father takes him out on his bodyboard. Jorge Tirado, 43, captured footage of his son riding the waves for the first time on a GoPro camera, and uploaded online. Like a pro: The footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board . The footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves, and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave. Although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water, it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves. Tirado does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in Puerto Rico. Not impressed... Jorge's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave . The baby is visible at the height of a huge wave, bracing himself for impact, with his father propped up over him . The baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave, but handles the impact well . Although there was some criticism over the stunt from online viewers, the dad defended the decision to take his son who he did not name into the water saying: 'My son first try. Thanks to everyone. 'I encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean, after all the ocean is the place where it all began. 'By far, this is the best sport for your spiritual, mental and physical health.' In the video, Jorge can be seen holding his son, who is unnamed, and getting him ready for a day's surfing. As the two ride ride through the middle of the tube of a wave, the baby is all smiles at the motion . Just chilling: Jorge Tirado, 43, floats with his son in preparation before entering the waves . Beginner's nerves: At first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water, but he soon learns to love the movement through the water . The baby is then seen in the water, with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board. At times, the tot doesn't look impressed, as the water cascades over him. But he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer. While taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous, it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age. Pro-surfer John John Florence, 22, for example, has said that he was only six-months-old when his mother put him in a life vest and sat him on the nose of her surfboard as she paddled into waves.

"A senior writer for the Australian Financial Review has labelled Anzacs 'racist yobs', while standing up for an SBS football reporter who was sacked after condemning Anzac day on Twitter. SBS journalist Scott McIntyre was fired on Sunday over his tweets which called Anzac day 'the cultification of an imperialist invasion' and accused Australian Diggers of committing war crimes which included 'widespread rape and theft.' Speaking up in support of him, the AFR's Geoff Winestock wrote on the social media site: 'Ridiculous. Frightening. I also think Anzacs were racist yobs and Anzac Day is a death cult. Sack me Fairfax.' On Friday, the day before Anzac day, Mr Winestock said of the memorial: 'Anzac Day wish: in next 30 years there will be no wars and in 50 years no soldiers around to honour.' Scroll down for video . Australian Financial Review journalist Geoff Winestock (left) has spoken out in support of sacked SBS journalist Scott McIntyre (right), who was fired on Sunday over his controversial Anzac day tweets . The senior writer for the Australian Financial Review labelled Anzacs 'racist yobs' The day before Anzac day, Mr Winestock said he hoped 'in 50 years no soldiers around to honour' Both Fairfax and Mr Winestock declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. After a public backlash against McIntyre's comments, SBS Managing Director Michael Ebeid and Director of Sport, Ken Shipp said in a joint statement that his 'highly inappropriate and disrespectful' comments have 'caused his on-air position at SBS to become untenable.' 'Mr McIntyre’s actions have breached the SBS Code of Conduct and social media policy and as a result, SBS has taken decisive action to terminate Mr McIntyre’s position at SBS, with immediate effect.' McIntyre's comments sparked outrage late on Anzac day, with Communications Minister Malcolm Turnball calling them 'despicable remarks' and social media users taking to twitter to spread the #sackScottMcIntre hashtag. In his tweets, the SBS football journalist condemned Anzac day as an 'imperialist invasion.' McIntyre referred to the Anzac's landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey . 'We remember and commemorate our ANZACs': SBS Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the broadcaster from McIntyre's comments on Saturday evening, saying they are 'not at all the views of @SBS' 'The cultification of an imperialist invasion of a foreign nation that Australia had no quarrel with is against all ideals of modern society,' McIntyre tweeted, referring to the Anzac's landing on Turkey's Gallipoli peninsula. In other tweets, the reporter mocked the 'these brave Anzacs' and accused Diggers of committing war crimes. 'Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these 'brave' Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,' he tweeted. 'Wonder if the poorly-read, largely white, nationalist drinkers and gamblers pause today to consider the horror that all mankind suffered. Mr McIntyre has more than 30,000 Twitter followers.

"Prosecutor Nafir Afzal said hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber . Hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber, putting children in danger of being radicalised, the country's most senior Muslim prosecutor has said. Nafir Afzal said teenagers are at risk of 'jihadimania' and warned that 'another 7/7' could happen unless Britain makes sweeping changes to the way it tackles terrorism. Mr Afzal, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the north-west, said children are 'manipulated' by Islamists and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation. He told the Guardian's Nigel Bunyan: 'The boys want to be like them and the girls want to be with them. That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image. 'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers – they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.' Mr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services. The prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack. He believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures. 'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension – a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said. Mr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation . The prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right) 'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.' Hundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain. His comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group. Waheed Ahmed, 21 – the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed – is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS. Ahmed, a politics student at Manchester University, was arrested by

"San Francisco 49ers player Chris Borland, a leading rookie last season, is retiring from the NFL at age 24 over health concerns related to repeated head trauma, ESPN and the team said on Monday. ESPN reported he was retiring over health concerns related to head trauma, an issue that has rattled the league and prompted a massive lawsuit against the NFL. 'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' Borland told ESPN's Outside the Lines. 'From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.' He continued: 'I just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.' Scroll down for video . San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland is retiring from the NFL over health concerns related to repeated head trauma . Borland, who played college football at University of Wisconsin, played just one year in the NFL with the 49ers . The 49ers did not specify in its statement why Borland chose to leave after just one season. 'From speaking with Chris, it was evident that he had put a great deal of thought into this decision. He was a consummate professional from day one,' 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. 'While unexpected, we certainly respect Chris' decision.' Borland, a linebacker, was a star in his only season with the team, registering 108 tackles, a quarterback sack and two interceptions, and earned several rookie of the week and rookie of the month honors. An ankle injury in December ended his season. He has had two prior concussions and said he notified the 49ers of his decision on Friday, which the team confirmed. Borland, who had two concussions prior to retirement, made his announcement on Friday. 'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' he told ESPN's Outside the Lines program . The third-round NFL Draft choice said he was being 'proactive' despite feeling 'as sharp as I've ever been.' 'I'm concerned that if you wait till you have symptoms, it's too late,' Borland said. 'There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that X will happen.' He becomes the most prominent NFL player to turn his back on a rich contract, a four-year deal worth just under $3million in Borland's case, over concerns about brain injuries. The announcement comes as an unexpected blow to the 49ers, who have already had a difficult off-season and also saw standout linebacker Patrick Willis retire last week. Many sports reporters and commentators went to Twitter to express their thoughts about Borland's retirement. Tim Kawakami from the San Jose Mercury News Tweeted that he found the culture of football - and the lifestyle that comes with it - to be changing . His Tweet suggests that Borland's decision could mean putting him at the forefront of changing the perspectives of football . NFL.com's Michael Silver suggested that people should take a step back from what Borland's retirement means for the 49ers and look at what it

"The 19-year-old, named locally as Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld (above) from Stamford hill, London, was pulled from the water in Hampstead Heath, north London, after getting into difficulty while swimming . Police officers 'watched' as a group of teenagers desperately tried to save their friend who drowned in Hampstead Heath pond, it has been claimed. Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld, 19, from Stamford Hill, London, had been swimming with four friends as temperatures reached 25C when he got into difficulty. An eyewitness has said at least seven police officers stood on a bank and watched as the boys dived in and out looking for their friend. The teenagers were reportedly heard shouting to ambulance crews on the side, asking how long someone could survive under water as they scrambled around trying to save their friend. It is thought Mr Greenfield may have had a cardiac arrest because of the shock of jumping into the cold water. His body was eventually discovered five foot below the surface and 20ft from the water's edge just before 11pm on Wednesday - nearly six hours after he was reported in trouble at 5.30pm. James Eisen, a 43-year-old freelance journalist, said: 'I was walking past and I could see a lot of commotion going on over the far side of the pond. 'The guy's friends were going in and out of the water and holding their breath and diving under frantically. 'There were police officers and paramedics and firefighters on the bank just standing there watching while the boys dived under. There was at least seven police officers on the side. 'It was a chaotic and surreal scene. 'I heard one of the boys shouting to one of the ambulance crews and asking how long someone could survive under water without breathing as they continued swimming around in a panic. 'I'm guessing the emergency services are told not to go into the water but if that's the case they probably shouldn't have let the boys carry on swimming about. 'Before I left the police helicopter was flying over and they had launched some boats onto the pond.' Mr Grunfeld's family have paid tribute to the teenager, who they described as a 'wonderful' and 'friendly' man, but said there was no blame because they believed that was the way God was meant to 'take him.' Mr Greenfeld, who is from the Orthodox Jewish community and is thought to have lost his Rabbi father to cancer five years ago, had recently flown home to London from New York, where he was studying religion at a Jewish college. Tragically, he only returned the UK to be with his family during the Passover holiday. His sister, who asked not be named, said: 'He was a wonderful young man and lovely brother who was very well liked, friendly, and he will be dearly missed by his family and friends. 'He was very into studies but he was very fun to be with and he would always try to lend a hand.” Police, specialist divers and 30 firefighters scoured the water for the missing teenager and

"Los Angeles (CNN)Even as major airports across the country clamp down on employee screening, a lone wolf could still potentially slip through security, a top airport official said. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. Patrick Gannon, police chief of Los Angeles International Airport, said the 54,000 employees with security badges undergo recurring criminal background checks and random screening. But even that may not be enough. ""I agree that in any airport throughout the United States and here also, there is never a 100% guarantee that somebody who wanted to do something illegal or wrong couldn't make that happen,"" Gannon said. Only two major airports in the United States -- Miami and Orlando -- conduct full employee screening by requiring all employees with access to secure areas to pass through a metal detector, a CNN investigation found. Other airports like Los Angeles conduct random screenings. Many airports don't do any screenings at all other than a criminal background check before employees are hired. The crackdown on employee screening comes after the arrest of a Delta baggage handler and passenger accused of gun smuggling at Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in December. Both Atlanta and Los Angeles have since begun restricting access by closing access doors that lead to the airfield. Nevertheless, Gannon acknowledged that the potential of a lone wolf committing a crime at the airport worries him. ""It concerns me all the time,"" he said. With so many employees, ""[T]here is no way that you are going to have the ability to screen every single person that comes to work in the airport."" At LAX, employees punch in a code and swipe their badge to access the airfield. Gannon said about 18 out of approximately 300 access doors have been closed as the airport evaluates employee screening procedures. He said, ""the more you limit the access doors, the more you can focus things like spot checks and screenings and cameras."" Even at Miami International Airport, Gannon said, ""they still can't 100% say that they can keep contraband or any type of item out of their restricted area."" Lauren Stover, Miami airport security director, agreed that ID badges alone ""are not enough [to] stop malicious intent."" ""You can vet employees for basic information on their backgrounds, but it's not going to prevent them from carrying out some kind of malicious activity against an airport. And airports need to know their threats. For us, we have threats from criminal activity to being targets of a terrorism attack,"" Stover said. In the wake of congressional scrutiny of airport employee screening procedures, private security guards at Atlanta's airport last month began checking employee bags as the first step toward moving toward full employee screening. The airport also plans to reduce the number of secure access doors from 70 to 10. ""In the last six months ... people are being recruited to engage in terrorist acts,"" said Miguel Southwell, the airport's general manager. ""People are being recruited from the United States. So now we have a greater insider threat."" The TSA is conducting a review

"The cost of a daily lunchtime takeaway can be crippling and yet instead of making lunches at home the majority of British workers still pop to the high street to grab their midday meal. The 'meal deal' (which is not always a meal, or a deal) has seen us stave off the hunger pangs with soggy sandwiches, slimy salads and salty soups, spending an average of £1,840 a year. But we could save up to £1,300 a year if we just prepared our lunch at home. Cheese, crackers and charcuterie is a simple and delicious lunch which can be easily assembled in the office . Food website Food52's 'Not Sad Desk Lunch' series demonstrates just how simple it can be to bring healthy, cost-effective, and delicious lunches to work. These incredibly detailed ideas and recipes show how to make everything from easy-to-assemble options such cheese and crackers, to more complicated steamed Chinese buns, and Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches . Each recipe on Food52 is contributed by a member of the team who promises to keep your midday meals 'both interesting and pretty.' If you're after something simple, cheese, crackers and charcuterie will do the job. Simply choose your favourites, assemble and eat; and If you're vegetarian, swap meat for pickled vegetables and you're good to go. Make something complicated like stuffed dumplings (left) or keep it simple with a toast tartine (right) Hannah Petertil has some inspired combinations which include Cheddar, apple, and bacon jam; mozzarella and prosciuotto or manchego and dried apricots. Keeping with the theme, you could also use the handy cracker to spread a variety of toppings. Make a Greek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta; a hummus cracker with roasted red pepper on top; pesto crackers with thinly sliced prosciutto; or smashed avocado crackers. Don't feel like spreading? Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go. Workers could save up to £1,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed. More than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of £1,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals. In comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just £552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping £1,288. The startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home. Pita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables. Experiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes. Remember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita. Still sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine. Spread with butter or mayonnaise and top with
