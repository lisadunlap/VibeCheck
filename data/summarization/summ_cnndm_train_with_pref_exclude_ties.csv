"Five former patients of Desmond D'Mello have tested positive for hepatitis C after claims he ignored infection control rules . Five former patients of a dentist accused of putting lives at risk amid claims he flouted infection control rules, have tested positive for hepatitis C. Desmond D'Mello's alleged refusal to follow NHS safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days. NHS England alerted 22,000 patients after fears they could have been exposed to blood-borne diseases including HIV and hepatitis while being treated at the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham. A total of 4,526 patients were tested and five were diagnosed with hepatitis C as a result, health bosses confirmed. No cases of hepatitis B or HIV were found. The recall was issued in November, and an investigation into apparent breaches of infection control procedures by Mr D'Mello was launched. The dentist, who ran his practice for 32 years, was suspended. Dr Doug Black, Medical Director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said: 'We have always been clear that the risk to patients was low, but we still had a duty to inform patients of this and offer the option for them to be tested. 'Treatments are available for all of the blood-borne viruses tested for, so we are pleased that these individuals have been identified and offered clinical support to aid their well-being. 'Now that this patient screening exercise is complete, we will be focusing our efforts on what we can learn from this incident and ensuring all our findings are shared with the General Dental Council to inform their ongoing investigation into Mr D'Mello.' Mr D'Mello is being investigated by the Care Quality Commission and the General Dental Council after he was secretly filmed by a whistleblower failing to change his medical gloves between patients or properly sterilise equipment. The dentist went to ground after his work was called into question and has never spoken publicly about the allegations. Dr Vanessa MacGregor, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England, East Midlands said: 'With such a high number of people being tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, the small number of positives that have been picked up as a result of screening is in line with what we would expect to see due to the very low prevalence of these blood-borne viruses within the community. 'Effective treatments are available for all blood-borne viruses, which is why it is important to identify anyone who may have been at risk of infection, so treatment can be started if necessary.' Mr D'Mello, who ran the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham, which has now changed name and is under new ownership, sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days amid allegations he failed to follow NHS safety procedures . Patients who tested positive were informed by their GPs and referred for further clinical advice and testing. Since August 2014 the former Daybrook Dental Practice has been under new ownership by Southern Dental, which is not

"Whiskey lovers all over the world claim the key to the perfect bourbon is time. But a catastrophic shortage of whiskey could soon be on the way with anecdotal reports suggesting the demand for bourbon is about to outstrip supply. Now, some distillers have taken heed of the warnings and are coming up with radical new ways to mature whiskey to its full potential faster than ever before. Whiskey lovers all over the world will tell you the key to the perfect bourbon is time. But a catastrophic shortage of whiskey could soon be the way with anecdotal reports suggesting the demand for bourbon is about to outstrip supply . According to a report by Tasha Eichensehert in Nautilus, the popularity of bourbon last year saw 19 million cases sold, generating $2.7 billion in revenue. She claims that through a series of inventive ageing methods, manufacturers have been able to cut the two-to-20-year process into just days and months. The ageing of whiskey usually takes place in 200-litres (53 American gallons) barrels made from seasoned American white oak, Quercus alba. These barrels are charred, breaking down the lignin in the wood into compounds called aldehydes. Adding alcohol to the barrel causes oxidation which transforms the aldehydes into acids. Changes in heat within the barrel then give whiskey its complex flavour. Through a series of inventive ageing methods, manufacturers have been able to cut the two-to-20-year process whiskey ageing process into just days and months . Nautilus reports that Tuthilltown Spirits in Gardiner, New York - the makers of Hudson Baby Bourbon – are now letting the alcohol settle in 2- to 5-gallon oak barrels. This, they say, increases the alcohol-to-barrel-surface ratio, causing the whiskey to mature faster, cutting the time down to around four months. Meanwhile Copper Fox Distillery in Virginia is adding toasted oak chips their barrel, in another attempt to increase the alcohol-to-surface ratio. One distillery in South Carolina claims it has cut the process down to just eight hours. Terressentia, near Charleston, first filters the whiskey in plastic tanks. There are concerns that pubs could become a thing of the past as thousands close each year due to spiralling production costs. But a new machine could help landlords feeling the pinch, because it can produce pints that cost just 35 pence (53 cents) each. The Truebrew Technobrewery can make 280 pints of beer in just two hours at the touch of a button. A similar size to an industrial oven, the machine is intended for business use and will cost around £25,000 ($38,000). The machine allows landlords to brew their own beer for a quarter of the price of buying it in from a brewery. The machine is filled it with water, and then ingredients including hops are placed inside. It's then switched on for two hours. The machine is self-cleaning and the beer is ready to drink seven days later. This speeds up the aldehyde and acid reaction creating chemical compounds that can be consumed in a matter of hours. Entrepreneurs have also created home tools for people

"A newborn baby girl who was found dead inside a garbage can outside an Ohio sorority house last week was born alive and then suffocated, according to the coroner. A preliminary ruling from the Muskingum County coroner on Monday said the baby found at Muskingum University campus was nearly full term when she was born, NBC4 reported. The child's mother is a student at the small school in New Concord, authorities said last week, but they have refused to release her name. Scroll down for video . Found: A newborn girl was found inside the trash outside the Delta Gamma Theta sorority house, pictured, at Muskingum University last Wednesday. It has now emerged the baby was alive when she was born . They interviewed her after the child's body was found on Wednesday night outside the Delta Gamma Theta sorority house on Lakeside Drive. No charges have been filed. A University police officer called the sheriff’s office at around 9pm on Wednesday after he reported seeing a dead newborn outside the building. The body was inside a plastic bag in the garbage can, according to reports. It's the second time a baby has died of asphyxiation at the school, The Times Reporter noted. Jennifer Bryant, then 22, was arrested on involuntary manslaughter and other charges in 2002 after she gave birth to a baby boy in her campus apartment and then put him in the trash. He later died. Bryant, who was a student at the school, pleaded guilty and was sentenced in to three years in prison in 2003, but she was released after seven months. Tragic: It is the second time an abandoned baby has died at the university campus in eastern Ohio. In 2002, the body of a baby boy was found in a dumpster and his mother served seven months in prison . Ohio has a Safe Haven Law that's been in place since 2001 allowing mothers of newborns to anonymously leave their child at a hospital or fire station. The newborn is then placed with child services and hopefully then put in a loving home. As long as the newborn shows no sign of abuse or neglect then the mother does not face any legal charges. Muskingum University, which is about 70 miles east of Columbus, has 3,000 students. See below for video .

"From underground bunkers and tactical bicycles to heavily armored vehicles, they were taught new ways to deal with a zombie apocalypse or a natural disaster - and also met some TV stars. Hundreds of survivalists and so-called 'Preppers', of all ages and levels of 'experience', descended on the Salt Lake City, Utah, suburb of Sandy on Friday for the nation's first ever PrepperCon. During the two-day expo, they were shown specially-equipped underground bunkers, learned new methods of storing food, tried out solar powered flashlights - and even dressed up as zombies. They were also greeted by actors from the AMC hit show 'The Walking Dead', including Addy Miller, who took pictures with fans and acted as a judge in an emergency preparedness food cook-off.

Scott Stallings, one of PrepperCon's founders, said the event was inspired by ComicCon's success, adding that he had amped up the entertainment with the hope of attracting younger attendees. He said that Utah made sense for America's first expo because of the Mormon culture's emphasis on food storage and self-reliance. Among the expo's main events was a zombie costume contest. 'In the prepping industry, we look at zombies as a metaphor,' said Mr Stallings, who lives in Murray. 'Anyone that's coming to take away your stuff, your safety, inflict harm on your family.' Vendors who filled the South Towne Expo Center on Friday and Saturday showed off an array of gear to help people survive a zombie apocalypse, a natural disaster or life in the wilderness. This gear included knives of all shapes and sizes, hi-tech gadgets, food storage units, first aid supplies and armored trucks. There were also live demonstrations and the survival cooking contest.

"Saturday Night Live pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining ISIS, and not the US Army, at the end. The segment was laid out the same as the recent My Bold Dad spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his Toyota Camry. The spot that first aired during the 2015 Super Bowl and was seen as a touching look at what it is like to say goodbye for those that have family members in the service. In this version however, the father, played by Taran Killam, dropped off his daughter, played by Dakota Johnson, and as he tearfully said goodbye she says to him; 'Dad, it's just ISIS.' Scroll down for video . Dakota Johnson (above) played a young girl joining ISIS in a skit on Saturday Night Live . The skit ended with the tagline; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad' There was even a vehicle with the ISIS flag in the skit . This is the first time that Johnson, the star of Fifty Shades of Grey, has hosted Saturday Night Live . From there, Johnson jumped on a truck with actors playing members of the Islamic State and with a mock flag, which actually appears to read; 'I would like a cat.' When the father then says to take care of his girl, one of the men yells; 'Death to America.' Then, as the commercial ended, a message appeared on screen; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad.' Johnson winked at her father to assure him everything was all right in the parody . Some on twitter found the parody 'depraved' Others on twitter found the bit 'hysterical' Johnson teels her father not to worry saying, 'Dad, it's just ISIS' This all comes on the same week three men were arrested in the United States with ties to the terrorist organization and three female British teenagers left to join the group. The skit was met with outrage by many on Twitter, who took the program to task for being insensitive. 'Can't be serious. Isis skit? Like going to college? When so many people are being kidnapped and killed?Depraved,' wrote Raine LaChance. 'Apparently NBC and SNL thought it was funny to have a skit showing ISIS driving to an airport to pick up an American girl. Tasteless Scum!,' said Jim Ematrudo. Others however found the skit 'hilarious.' This also comes the same week that the identity of ISIS member Jihadi John was revealed and the group destroyed a collection of priceless statues and sculptures in Iraq dating back thousands of years in Mosul. John is British citizen Mohammed Emwazi, the man who is responsible for the high-profile beheadings of Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Steven Sotliff as well as British citizens David Haines and Alan Henning in the name of the terrorist organization.

"Ever fancied driving the Batmobile straight from the big screen and into your street? Or perhaps you've always yearned to take the Ghostbusters' Cadillac for a spin? Well now it's possible to do both thanks to brothers Marc and Shanon Parker - who have designed and built a fantastic fleet of movie-inspired vehicles. Among their wonders on wheels are lifelike versions of Batman's Tumbler from the Dark Knight film trilogy and the much-loved Ghostbusters car - or Ecto-1 as the spook-hunting team call it. The brothers have even made an Optimus Prime truck, based on the most recent Transformers movie, as well as a Tron-inspired motorbike. Scroll down for video . Park your eyes on these beauties: The Parker brothers' Batman Tumbler and Ghostbusters Cadillac . Fuelling envy: Designer Shanon Parker fills up his Ecto-1 at a petrol station in Port Canaveral, Florida . Marc said: 'We get a lot of reactions in the street - a lot of times people will come up next to us and box us in, wanting to take pictures. 'We test-drove one of our motorcycles on the road and the police were called because we were causing a traffic jam. If you're doing something that's causing that kind of reaction, you know you're doing something right.' Take Bat! The brothers' impressive version of the Tumbler, Batman's car in the Dark Knight trilogy . Attention to detail: The number plate and interior are very similar to the original Batmobile . Real deal: The Tumbler in the 2005 movie Batman Begins, which was directed by Christopher Nolan . The car-crazy brothers from Port Canaveral, Florida, started building versions of the vehicles they most loved for their own enjoyment four years ago. Marc, 45, said: 'We didn't have the money to pay people to customise vehicles for us, and what we needed didn't exist so we had to learn to build our parts. 'Every part of the Tumbler was made from scratch in our shop - the frame, chassis, wheels, glass, everything. 'I don't know what it cost to build - I'd probably cry if I looked into it - but as far as value, it's one of the most expensive vehicles we own.'

He and Shanon, 44, have now turned their hobby into a business - called Parker Brothers Concepts - and they hire out their movie-inspired cars and motorbikes to fans. They also customise standard cars and bikes for clients, several of whom are famous. Shanon is in charge of design, while mechanic Marc brings the drawings to life in the brothers' workshop.

Education secretary Nicky Morgan has ordered an urgent investigation into the school after it emerged two dead Islamist fighters were also taught at Quintin Kynaston Academy in north London. Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, was killed fighting with terrorists in Syria in 2013 after joining up with an al-Qaeda group, while Mohammed Sakr, 27, died fighting for Al-Shabbab in Somalia. Their deaths and the fact Jihadi John was revealed as former pupil Mohammed Emwazi last week has raised questions over what measures are in place to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers. Ministers have ordered an urgent investigation into the school attended by Mohammed Emwazi (pictured left) after it emerged two dead extremist fighters - including Choukri Ellekhlifi (right) - were also taught there . Yesterday the Government announced an urgent internal review into whether enough had been done at the school. Mrs Morgan has ordered officials to examine all evidence, including school records and inspection findings, to establish whether enough was done to prevent teenagers becoming radicalised. The Department for Education review aims to help officials understand how to prevent pupils or former pupils becoming extremists and travelling 'to Syria or other areas of concern', a spokesman said. The spokesman added: 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review all schools that fit this category. 'Our understanding of the challenge, and the way we monitor the ability of schools to respond to it, has advanced hugely in the past few years. Quintin Kynaston Academy's (pictured) head insisted the school is 'not a breeding ground for terrorists' 'As part of this, this government set-up a dedicated Due Diligence and Counter Extremism division within the DfE and they are working tirelessly to develop our understanding of the problem and to see if and where we can offer help to schools with pupils or former pupils who have since travelled to Syria or other areas of concern. 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review those schools where we have evidence of links with pupils who have travelled to Syria. 'The allegations about Quintin Kynaston may be historic and it is clearly a completely different school today, but I'm sure we will look back at the evidence from the time as part of this review to see if there are any lessons we can learn for the future.' The Telegraph reports both Ellekhlifli and Sakr were 'close associates' of Emwazi.

Alicia Carroll, of Garland, faces a charge of abandoning and endangering a child. The 28-year-old remained in Dallas County Jail Monday on $25,000 bond. Police say Carroll called police Sunday morning saying the person she left her daughter with on Saturday night would not return the child. Bad parenting: Alicia Carroll, 28, has been charged with child endangerment after Dallas police say she made her daughter sleep alone in a dumpster . But according to police documents, the 7-year-old girl said her mother told her to 'hide' in the trash bin after the two exited the popular King Spa and Sauna on Royal Lane. Officers found the little girl 10 hours later after being flagged down by citizens who saw her looking filthy and barefoot. When she was interviewed by police, Miss Carroll said she had been drinking at the spa and at around 10pm stepped out to 'clear her head,' leaving her daughter inside with an acquaintance, reported Dallas Morning News. However, a King Spa worker told NBC 5 that the mother and daughter left the establishment together after attending a party with friends. When police finally caught up with the 7-year-old girl at around 11.15am Sunday, she told them that when she and her mother left the spa, Carroll suddenly took off running. The child claimed that Carroll told her they were being pursued by police and had to go into hiding. According to investigators, Carroll then placed her daughter in a garbage container in a 'high-crime' area and fled. The little girl eventually fell asleep amid refuse and woke up only 10 hours later. She was able to scramble out of the dumpster and began walking down Royal Lane towards the spa. Passersby spotted her on the street walking without shoes and called police. Officers who responded to the scene described the child as thirsty, hungry, and covered in filth and cuts to her arms and legs.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely detached scene for the close of America's longest war: military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar, high security bases, on Black Hawks, miles from the front line. But it is how Washington wants this to be. And even though the departure of American troops will be fractionally slower, they will all be inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year, making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire. We are near Jalalabad, at a regional logistics hub for the Afghan police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms, ammunition, even fuel for vehicles. The intentions, first hatched in 2011 when the U.S. had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here, were large in scale. But the project has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception. We are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks. Dozens of Afghan police gather there, and mill around, waiting for their commanders to arrive. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: Afghan forced to marry her rapist . Yet a few problems are immediately visible. There are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we're told they've been removed while a new master key is being sought. There seem to be few supplies in the actual hub. We ask the Afghan policemen how many of them get resupplied there, at this stage, four months since it opened, and they say: none. About 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base, but supplies often still come from where they did before -- Kabul. U.S. officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the Afghan army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need. But here, now, that seems far away. As does the base, incidentally. It's quite a rough drive from the main road, surrounded by hills, and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: ISIS recruits in Taliban territory . And it is far away in terms of its cost. Like so much in the most costly of wars, its price tag may have made sense in briefings on Capitol Hill, where effectiveness is gauged in millions, but here in dusty eastern Afghanistan, it seems exorbitant. This as-yet, partially functional resupply hub cost $21 million, a price that presumably includes new doorhandles. There are about fifty Afghan police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $400,000 to the US taxpayer. But this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the U.S. trainers here face: working, as they are, against a clock, with diminishing resources and public interest, in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where, when the Taliban aren't thriving,

"A wartime scientist has revisited the secret underground factory where she helped build aircraft engines 70 years since the end of the Second World War. Mary Cartwright was 20 when she was called up to work in the laboratory at Drakelow Shadow Factory in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, in 1943. She spent two years testing metal for Bristol aircraft engines in the site's underground laboratory, working as the only woman in her department. Now, 70 years after leaving her position, the 91-year-old great-grandmother has revisited the now defunct factory. Mary Cartwright revisited Drakelow Underground Factory in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, where more than 700 people worked during the war (right) to produce aircraft engines. Now 91, the great grandmother tested metal for aircraft engines . Revisiting the site with her son, David, Mrs Cartwright said it was 'strange' to see it so quiet. She worked as the only woman in its laboratory between 1943 and 1945 . Built in 1943, the factory became known as Drakelow Tunnels for its vast network of underground paths spread over three-and-a-half miles. It was one of 26 'shadow' sites set-up to mass produce engines and parts for military aircraft and tanks that were built underground or into hillside so that production could continue if bombed. Designed by Rover at the behest of the Air Ministry, Drakelow employed 700 people when Mrs Cartwright began working there.

"Just like humans learning to talk, puppies can sometimes take a while to learn to bark. At least, that seemed to be the case for one young Shibu Inu, who caused hilarity with a somewhat chatty display at an American Kennel Club centre. The pup was filmed squeaking and squawking after meeting a young husky dog and attempting to bark at its new companion. Captured on video, the puppies are held in the air by their respective handlers and one of the dogs makes a high-pitched whining sound. Opening its mouth, the Shibu Inu then begins vocalising with a yappy bark before the husky – leaning back in its handler’s arm – whines. People standing by laugh and put their hands to their mouths as a staff member turns to address and pacify the dog. The puppy Shibu Inu and husky feature opposite one another while conversing at an American Kennel Club centre . Falling quiet for a second, the Shibu Inu pipes up once more – louder than before – causing the husky to respond. As the dogs continue to converse, the video maker asks with a giggle: ‘What is that noise?’ But it is barely audible over the sounds of the intense barking, whining and yapping. Later in the video the excited Shibu Inu begins running in its owner's arms in its attempts to get closer to the husky. Passers-by laugh and film the two dogs as they begin yapping, whining and barking at one another . And people in the video can be seen laughing while mimicking the dog’s erratic and entirely humorous actions. The video concludes with the husky losing interest slightly and chewing on its handler’s sleeve. Before the same handler speaks to the Shibu Inu and gives it a rub, causing it to momentarily settle down. A staff member from the American Kennel Club centre attempts to pacify the puppy by giving it a rub . Canine vocalisation usually begins when a puppy is around two-to-three-weeks-old and generally consists of grunts and whines. At seven-to-eight-weeks-old, the vocalisation will develop into stronger sounding barks, although some dogs wait as long as 16 weeks before even making an attempt.

"Gaffe: Broadcaster John Inverdale, pictured, excused his foul language as a 'slip of the tongue' BBC presenter John Inverdale was forced to apologise after swearing during radio coverage of the Cheltenham Festival. Speaking on BBC 5 Live, the veteran broadcaster accidentally said 'rose-c***ed' glasses when reflecting on the career of former jockey John Francome. He quickly corrected himself and apologised before explaining it had been a 'slip of the tongue'. Inverdale made the embarrassing gaffe while interviewing Francome and rising racing star Lizzie Kelly earlier today. Francome, who became a racing pundit after retiring from the sport, said: 'You get wet, you're mucking out, and it's hard work. 'But through all of that it's a way of life that most of them wouldn't swap, a lot of people go off and do other things and then come back to it.' To which Inverdale replied: 'This is looking at it through rose-c***ed, rose-tinted glasses from the past... I apologise there for a slip of the tongue, but Lizzie your love of the sport just shines through.' Kelly, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in the last 12 months, struggled not to laugh as she said: Oh yeah, because, as I've said it's very important to love it or you wouldn't do it otherwise.' It is not the first time that Inverdale's language has landed him in trouble. He made headlines last year when he said 't**t' during an interview with former tennis World No. 1 tennis star Jim Courier during French Open coverage.

"A short circuit has temporarily rendered Nasa's Curiosity rover inactive as engineers investigate the problem. The Mars rover stopped work when an electrical problem was discovered while it was using its arm to move powder into its sample container. The severity of the problem is not yet known, but Nasa said they expected to resume operations in several days if it can be resolved. A short circuit occurred in the rover's arm as it was moving. Nasa engineers in California are now investigating the problem. The rover (shown here in a recent mosaic image taken by its arm) had been transferring rock powder into a sample analysis container . 'We are running tests on the vehicle in its present configuration before we move the arm or drive,' said Curiosity Project Manager Jim Erickson, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'This gives us the best opportunity to determine where the short is.' The short circuit occurred while the rover was moving its arm on 27 February. When the rover detected the anomaly, it stopped the movement of its arm. Nasa said that such a brief short could have little effect on rover operations, or it 'could prompt the rover team to restrict use of a mechanism'. Quite how much lasting damage the short will have caused, if any, is not yet known. On Twitter the official account for the rover, @MarsCuriosity, said: 'Call me Johnny Five. Some ops on hold while my team investigates a short circuit.' The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. The fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover. This powder was taken from a rocket target called Telegraph Peak. Curiosity has successfully analysed five samples from drilling targets before in 2013 and 2014, but this is the first time this problem has arisen. On this particular occasion, Curiosity revealed the true colour of Mars was not red - but blue and grey. By drilling a few centimetres into the ground, the drill dug up material that had a different colouration to the surface. The fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover. This powder was taken from a rocket target called Telegraph Peak. The material appears blueish-grey, seen here, because it had not yet oxidised in the Martian air . The reason is that Mars is mostly made of silicon and oxygen, and also contains significant quantities of iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium and potassium. When the soil is exposed to the air it oxidises and 'rusts', giving it its red appearance. 'We're sort of seeing a new colouration for Mars here, and

"The oldest active pilot is a 95-year-old man living in Cameron Park, California. Guinness World Records has confirmed Peter Weber Jr.'s feat, the Sacramento Bee reported. 'I'm overwhelmed,' Weber told the newspaper. 'I'm getting all kinds of phone calls, emails and all that stuff.' Pilot: The oldest active pilot is a 95-year-old Peter Weber Jr., it's been revealed (March 2015 photo) Active: Weber has said he flies 'at least twice a month.' He also still has his driver's license (March 2015 file photo) The record was confirmed after Weber proved he piloted a plane March 30 in Placerville by mailing in multiple pieces of evidence, according to the Sacramento Bee. The newspaper reported that Weber's flight experience goes back decades: he flew in both World War II and the Vietnam War, and also served as a Korean War flight instructor. All told, Guinness World Records says on its website that 'Peter has been a pilot for 72 years.' According to Guinness, Weber was a flight cadet in 1943. 'Peter went on to become a Lieutenant Colonel in the US Air Force,' the website says. 'He retired from the Air Force in 1970, and since then has flown for recreational purposes.' Weber pulled off his March 30 flight at the age of 95 years and 143 days, Guinness says. Weber told the Sacramento Bee in March 'The reason I did it is because I though maybe I might have the record be - being the fact my age is 95 years, 4 months and 23 days.' Years of experience: Weber reportedly was a flight cadet in 1943 and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1970 (March 2015 file photo) At the time, he said that Guinness recently made a new category for the oldest qualified pilot who still has a license and flies alone while speaking to the newspaper. Weber has been married to his wife since 1943 and is a father to a 70-year-old son, according to reports. The Sacramento Bee reported Weber still has his driver's license -- and also pointed out that a since-deceased 105-year-old Colorado man holds the record for being the oldest pilot ever, according to Guinness. Cole Kugel's final flight took place in 2007 before he died that June, Guinness says.

"This is the spectacular moment a goose narrowly avoids a snapping fox’s jaw after the sly animal had given an almighty leap in a bid to take down the large bird. However despite the fox’s best efforts to capture the Canadian goose - it only came away with a single feather. The action-packed photographs were captured by Roger Byng, 67, on the Wetlands surrounding the Severn estuary in Slimbridge, Gloucester. Lunch! The hungry fox races across the grass towards the large Canada goose... Launch! He is poised to take off as his startled prey takes flight ... Mr Byng, from Bristol, was in a hide ‘with the intention of photographing small British birds, such as Bullfinches, Long-tailed Tits and Wrens as part of a relaxing day’s photography.’ However Mr Byng’s relaxing day’s photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye. ‘I suddenly saw it break into a run towards the geese so I quickly moved my camera and lens to focus on the fox,’ explained the married Grandfather-of-nine. ‘I had no time to change any settings on my camera but managed to capture the action as he tried to take down the goose.’ Gotcha! The fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird . Escape: The goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake . The retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey. ‘The fox was on a search for food, evidently being hungry enough to tackle a large goose. ‘It broke into a run in an effort to take one of the geese, who at the last moment caught sight of his approach. ‘Whilst one of the geese clears the grass and rises into the air quite quickly, the other one was slower to rise enabling the fox to get close. Spitting feathers! The unsuccessful fox drops back down to earth . ‘It jumped into the air to make a grab, with jaws open and teeth displayed. It is the good fortune of the goose that he gained just sufficient height that the fox was only able to get a bite on his tail feathers. ‘The fox came away with a single feather, whilst the goose escaped with a squawk!’ The wetlands that the pictures were taken on are managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and can be accessed by paying a small fee or by taking out an annual membership granting you entry to all of the sites in the UK. Mr Byng adds: ‘Slimbridge is a wonderful location for witnessing the activity of a large number of birds and wildlife, including migratory species such as Bewick Swans.’

The 40lb shells, which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador named after Sir Barnes Wallis - the inventor of the bouncing bomb.

Sir Barnes Wallis: Inventor of the 'bouncing bomb' Barnes Wallis was a British aviation engineer who is famous for designing the 'bouncing bomb' that was used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. Born in Derbyshire, Wallis worked first as for a marine engineering firm before transferring to working on aircraft. When the Second World War began, Wallis was assistant chief designer of aviation at Vickers' engineering. He came up with the concept behind the bouncing bomb while skipping his daughter's marbles across a tub of water by catapault. But it took more than a year to convince RAF chiefs that such a bomb might work and should be attempted. Once he was given the go-ahead, he had only eight weeks to complete and test the design. The final solution, called Upkeep, was a cylindrical bomb, weighing four tons, spinning backwards at 500 rpm. It had to be dropped from precisely 60ft above the water at not more than 240mph.

"When Tony Ansell was given an Airfix kit at was six-years-old, it was something of an inspiration. Twenty years on the keen model maker has created a fleet of radio controlled warships at his workshop in Ferndown in Dorset. Each warship is made to scale, using original Royal Navy blueprints and photographs to ensure they capture a snapshot in time when the vessels were in action. Model maker Tony Ansell spent the last 20 years making scale models of radio controlled navy warships. His Dorset workshop features models of HMS Campbeltown (top), HMS Hood (middle) and HMS Fencer (bottom) Mr Ansell, a former plumber, uses original Royal Navy blueprints to make the scale models of the warships . And so dedicated is the former plumber to his craft that he is in the process of writing to the Queen to ask for permission to name one of his ships - a G3 battlecruiser - Beatty because the original was cancelled and therefore never named. 'You need to put in the research and I tend to pick a particular time in the ship's life to make it at because warships went in for refits lots and could be different from year to year,' said Mr Ansell, 63. 'I like to make ships you don't see at model shows very often and bigger ones are more of a challenge because you have to be more detailed.' Mr Ansell uses fibreglass to make the hull of the ships and flexible sheets of 1mm thick plastic for the rest of the structure. He researches each of the vessels before he makes them, using photographs to ensure accuracy. Most of the other items such as guns and aircraft are made from resin and mini Airfix kits. Constructing the models is a painstaking process, sometimes taking longer than it took to make the actual warships themselves. It took nine years for Mr Ansell to complete HMS Dreadnought laying each of the planks individually . Replica fighter planes sit on the deck of one of Mr Ansell's boats that make up his fleet of model warships . HMS Campbeltown was an American ship that was eventually transferred to the Royal Navy in 1940 . Mr Ansell's most recent build, the battleship HMS Dreadnought, is a 6ft long, 1:196 scale model and has as taken him nine years to finish - nine times longer than it took to build the actual warship in 1906. But the project was delayed by a lack of photographs of the vessel and he built two other models during that time. He has also made models of aircraft carrier HMS Fencer, HMS Campbeltown and HMS Hood, the ship sunk by the Germans in World War Two. As well as his scale warships, Mr Ansell has also created replicas of tanks, keeping them all to precise scale . The 63-year-old makes the models in his Dorset workshop and is seen consulting an original blueprint .

"(CNN)NASA astronaut Scott Kelly has started a trip to the record books. He plans to spend 342 days on the International Space Station -- the longest stretch of time any U.S. astronaut has spent in space. Kelly lifted off Friday aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket that launched from Kazakhstan. The rocket docked at the ISS at 9:33 p.m. ET, according to a tweet from NASA, with hatches between the Soyuz and the space station scheduled to open about 11:15 p.m. ET. Kelly will stay twice as long as any U.S. astronaut has ever stayed on the space station, giving scientists a chance to study how the human body responds to long-duration space flights. On Earth, scientists will perform parallel studies on Scott Kelly's identical twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. ""It's a lot of fun,"" Kelly said at a media briefing in January. ""Space station is a magical place."" Two cosmonauts are riding up with Kelly: Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka. Kornienko also will stay up for a year. Padalka will only stay up for six months. The trio will join three crew members already on the space station: U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. Other crew members also will rotate in and out during their year in orbit so it will never be just Kelly and Kornienko on the station. Kelly, 51, hopes to break the record for the longest mission on the space station set by NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin. They spent over seven months on the ISS -- from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. He is expected to spend 342 days off the planet on this mission. When added to his previous space missions, that would give him a total of 522 days in space, breaking the record of U.S. astronaut Mike Fincke. Fincke spent a combined 381 days, 15 hours and 11 minutes in space, according to his official NASA bio. While Kelly shoots to set space station and other U.S. records, Padalka is on schedule to set a record for the most total time in space for a human. He's already spent more than 710 days in space, including stays on Russia's Mir space station and three previous stints on the International Space Station. Why do it? Why stay up on the station so long? NASA wants to know more about the impact of long-duration spaceflights on the human body to help plan missions to Mars and deeper into space. And the space station, in orbit 250 miles above Earth, is the best place available to study that. Spending that much time in a weightless environment will take a toll. NASA says space station astronauts have vision changes, bone loss, muscle atrophy and other problems. NASA says the experiments should have benefits on Earth, such as helping patients recover from long periods of bed rest to improved monitoring of people whose bodies are unable to fight infections. The space station has about the same living space as a six-bedroom, two bathroom house. And

"Harry Kane deservedly tops this week's EA Sports' Performance Index after another pulsating weekend of Premier League football. Following his first call-up to the senior England squad, the 21-year-old striker capped a memorable week by netting his first Premier League hat-trick to help Spurs to a 4-3 victory against Leicester City. Kane is now the Premier League's joint-top scorer alongside Diego Costa and continues to lead the line brilliantly for Mauricio Pochettino's side while earning a Game Index score of 71, which is 11 points higher than Olivier Giroud in second place. Harry Kane went home with the match ball after scoring his first ever Premier League hat-trick . Kane slots past Kasper Schmeichel during Tottenham's 4-3 victory against Leicester City on Saturday . The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the Premier League. It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning performance . 2. Player's performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . Arsenal's French frontman earns the runner-up spot following another impressive brace which helped the Gunners put John Carver's Newcastle to the sword on Saturday. Giroud gave Newcastle defender Mike Williamson a torrid first 45 minutes in which he scored twice and completed 81.6 per cent of his passes for Arsene Wenger's side. Manchester United's midfielder Juan Mata completes the top three with a Game Index total of 56.3 after a stunning double against Liverpool as the Old Trafford club earned a hard-fought 2-1 victory at Anfield. Other names to make the top 10 list this week include Aaron Lennon thanks to his first goal in an Everton shirt and Manchester City's Fernando, who scored the crucial second goal while clocking up a 98 per cent pass completion rate against West Brom. Jose Mourinho's Chelsea got off to a flying start in the 3-2 victory against Hull and it was their star man Eden Hazard that put his side ahead inside two minutes. Hazard's brilliant display added with an 11th domestic strike of the season means the Belgian grabs sixth spot.

"(CNN)Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen on Thursday, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war, potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the Middle East. The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets, 30 from the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain, 10 from Qatar, and a handful from Jordan, Morocco and Sudan, plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt, according to a Saudi adviser. The Egyptian state news agency on Thursday quoted Egypt's Foreign Ministry as saying Egypt's support also could involve ground forces. What do those countries have in common? They're all predominantly Sunni Muslim -- in contrast to the Houthi rebels, Shiite Muslims who have taken over Yemen's capital of Sanaa and on Wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city, Aden. The Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. ""What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,"" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The airstrikes did not include warplanes from the United States, which has worked with Yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- to go after al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said ""there will be no military intervention by the U.S."" But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday did tell foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, according to a senior State Department official. How did Yemen get to this place? Houthi supreme leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, ""If any army try to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us."" He added, ""We call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner."" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's monthslong internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. ""This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,"" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iraq -- 60% of whose citizens are Shiite, with about 20% being Sunnis -- offered similar, albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its Foreign Ministry called ""the military interference of the Gulf Cooperation Council,"" which is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. ""We call on the Arab states to live up to their role to

"Crime and punishment: Erica Ginnetti, 35, has been sentenced to 30 days, house arrest and probation for having sex with a 17-year-old student . A disgraced Pennsylvania math teacher has been sentenced to 30 days in jail, house arrest and probation for having sex with a 17-year-old student and sending him X-rated photos. Erica Ann Ginneti, 35, a married mother of three from Philadelphia, pleaded guilty in December to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor. The former math and calculus teacher at Lower Moreland Township School District had been facing seven to 14 years in prison, but on Friday Judge Garrett Page sentenced her to 3-23 months, including the first 30 days in jail and the next 60 on house arrest. She also faces three years’ probation, 100 hours of community service and will have to register as a sex offender for the next 25 years, according to The Intelligencer. Ginneti’s jail terms begins April 10. In court Friday, Mrs Ginneti wept as she read a letter of apology in hopes of offering the victim 'closure for this nightmare.' Prosecutors said the boy had seen his grades drop in his senior year and has been struggling with social interactions. The former educator described for the court how she has reconciled with her family and embarked on a new career as a fitness instructor. In her time off, she volunteers at a church, reported Philadelphia Inquirer. Judge Garrett Page told Ginneti he was certain she would continue to turn her life around, but he reminded her that her ill-thought actions had had devastating consequences. 'One bad day because of sexual hunger has resulted in all this avalanche of harm,' Page stated. He also chastised her for sending her male student explicit photos and videos of herself, which he likened to ‘dangling candy’ in front of the boy. The judge later clarified that he does not think the defendant is a 'bad human being,' but stated she must be punished for her ‘bad act.’ Ginnetti, pictured above with her husband, first approached her victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym . Ginneti's attorney asked the judge to spare her jail time so she could care for her small children. She was fired by Lower Moreland Township School District after her arrest in January. According to investigators, the math and calculus teacher first approached the victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym. A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis. The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, she sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times. According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July

"A millionaire accused of making child pornography with two teenage girls has said that he thought the alleged victims were of-age women who worked at a strip club. Burton Gersh, 69, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, is accused of producing hundreds of sexually explicit photos of two girls, aged 16 and 17, in his lavish mansion beginning in 2010. He asked a federal judge to allow a 'mistake-of-age defense' in his pending trial in which he faces pornography charges. Burton Gersh (pictured above) is accused of producing hundreds of sexually explicit photos of two girls, aged 16 and 17, in his lavish mansion beginning in the fall of 2010 with accomplice Les Sidweber . The former seafood wholesaler also requested in a motion filed in federal court that jurors know the girls engaged in prostitution, according to USA Today. A federal prosecutor is reportedly fighting both requests. 'The alleged victims appeared to be over the age of 18 and both were strippers in a club in Philadelphia, presumably fooling a legitimate business about their age,' the motion from Gersh's attorney, Michael Engle, said. The motion adds that Gersh 'may not have reasonably been able to ascertain the alleged victims' ages because of their misrepresentations, physical appearance and stated occupation'. 'At least one' of the girls was given a release form to sign before the photo school, the motion said. Signing the motion would indicate 'that she was 18 years of age or older'. Gersh and his accomplice, photographer Les Sidweber, 73, were arrested and have been in federal custody since November 3. Their trial is set for May 19. One of the girls was allegedly approached while walking out of her school in her school uniform and encouraged to go to one of the defendant's houses for a modeling shoot. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Louis Lappen told CBS Philadelphia in November. One of the victims said that she was approached while walking out of school in her school uniform and encouraged to go to one of the defendant's houses for a modeling shoot. Illicit pictures show characteristics of Gersh's home, pictured above, investigators said . The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court claims that Gersh and Sidweber paid for the two Pennsylvania girls to come to their homes, strip naked and perform sex acts on one another and on Gersh. 'Once these men earned the trust of these victims, they exploited them on multiple occasions,' Lappen said. The illicit pictures show identifiable characteristics of Gersh's home, including one with a backyard gazebo that featured a sign 'Welcome to the Gershs', investigators told CBS Philadelphia. The defense claims that knowledge of the ages of the girls is crucial if Gersh is found guilty of 'purposefully' producing the child porgography. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan, however, said the mistake-of-age defense should not be taken into account. 'Knowledge that the victim was under the age of 18 is not an element of the crime,' Morgan said in a motion. She also said that allowing testimony on the victims' sexual experiences would be irrelevant and

"A woman who lost half her leg to bone cancer had her foot reattached backwards - and it wasn't a mistake. Shanna Decker, 24, was seven when she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma after complaining about a pain in her leg. Doctors said they would have to remove her left knee to save her life. But instead of an amputation, Decker opted for a 'rotationplasty': when the foot is attached to the thigh and rotated backwards. It means Decker, from Minnesota, has more control over her prosthetic calf. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Choice: Shanna Decker, 24, opted to have her left foot reattached to her thigh backwards after doctors removed her left knee. The operation, which removed a cancerous tumor, saved her life . The forward-facing heel acts as a new knee and the foot can move like a shin. If she needs to, Decker can even apply weight to the foot - which has retained its feeling - and walk on it. The then-novel procedure was one of three options available to Decker, while she endured a grueling chemotherapy program. Doctors could have amputated her leg below the thigh or created a 'stiff leg'. More control: The decision Decker and her parents made when she was seven (left) means that she now has more control over her prosthetic leg and can manoeuvre it better than if she had undergone an amputation . Delighted: Seven-year-old Decker was amazed at how quickly she learned to walk again after surgery . Due to her age, Decker was not eligible for 'limb salvage', where the missing tissue is replaced with transplanted or artificial tissue, as her legs were not fully developed. Instead, she opted for rotationplasty, which removes the tumor and the knee and rotates the foot 180 degrees. Writing on Rotationplasty.com, her mother said: 'I remember this being the hardest decision our family has ever faced. When we initially learned of rotationplasty, I have to admit, it took time to absorb. We had many questions and desperately wanted to connect with others who had already chosen this procedure, but found that to be difficult.' No regrets: Decker has now set up a foundation to help children who are considering rotationplasty too . Aside from the difficulty overcoming the appearance of her new leg, Decker said she never thought twice about it. And learning to walk was simple - unlike the months-long process most amputees endure. 'As soon as my leg healed, I was walking with a prosthetic and it took me about three seconds to learn how to rewalk,' Decker told Everyday Health. Hoping to inspire children who are facing the same predicament she tackled 17 years ago, Decker has founded a charity called Brighter Tomorrows that supports young cancer sufferers.

The mother-of-three, from Leeds, suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm. Now the 28-year-old has had to stop kissing her husband of four years, because the saliva on his lips can trigger a painful flare-up. Kerrie Armitage, from Leeds, suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She claims a kiss from her husband Peter (right) can trigger a painful flare-up, due to contact with his saliva . She said: 'Because Peter's lips are wet, the saliva can make me react. He's got to make sure his lips are dry before he gave me a kiss. 'It's not every time - I can do the same thing time and time again and not react, but then I'll do it once more and get a flare-up.' Her condition means that external exposure to water is the main problem, rather than drinking liquid. The situation has become so bad that hugging her children can trigger an episode, as their body heat makes her sweat - and she has trained herself not to cry. However, she added an allergic reaction tended to depend on the circumstances. 'For example, if Peter was to give me a kiss on a hot day when I'm flushed, I'd probably flare up, but maybe not if I was in a cool environment,' she said. 'It can be frustrating but he's really supportive. 'After years together, it's become normal. You learn how to get used it. But it can be bothersome.' Mrs Armitage now faces a daiily battle to protect her skin from agonising flare-ups - and has also been forced to give up her job as a cleaner because she cannot not touch water. Even hugging her children Katie, nine, Emily, two and four-year-old step-daughter Savannah, can become a nightmare as their body heat can trigger a reaction. 'It affects every aspect of my day to day life,' she said. 'I have to choose between doing the washing up and bathing my kids. My hands can't take them both – it's too painful.' She added: 'When I've got my children sat on me giving me a cuddle their body heat can cause me to sweat and have a reaction.

"Dustin Wayne South died in Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday after police were called to a field where South was seen wielding a gun . A 32-year-old man shot himself in the head during a firefight with police officers in Kentucky as horrified witnesses watched the chaotic scene unfold. Dustin Wayne South died Wednesday night at the Louisville scene, in a field behind Lassiter Middle School, a normally peaceful neighborhood in the southern part of the city. The shootout occurred after a neighbor saw South walking around the field while waving a gun in the air. Two bullets fired by police struck South, but neither was lethal, said Jo-Ann Farmer, chief deputy coroner. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Cherylyan Rayhel said she watched from a window as South waved a gun and fired into the air just behind her house about 8pm, which is when she reported the situation to the police. Officers yelled three times for him to drop the gun, but instead he raised it and pointed it at them, she said. Gunfire erupted. She did not see the man turn the gun on himself. 'I saw him fall; I screamed,' Rayhel said Thursday morning. 'I haven't slept all night.' The Louisville Metro Police Department identified the officers involved as Rondall Carpenter and Zachary Cooke. The officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. This is the second fatal shoot involving Carpenter in less than a year. Last October, he and another officer, Skylar Graudick, were involved in a shooting that killed 38-year-old William Chad Mattingly, who had allegedly fired on the officers. Louisville Metro Police officers Rondall Carpenter (left) and Zachary Cooke (right) were involved in a shootout with South, but South eventually shot himself in the head . The shooting remains under review with the commonwealth's attorney. On Wednesday night, Rayhel said she saw South fighting with a woman in the street in front of her house, just around the corner from South's home. South, weeping, hugged a young boy who was with the couple and turned to leave, Rayhel said. The boy tried to chase him, but the woman held him back. Neighbors described South as friendly and sweet. Sherri Reynolds said she often saw him in the neighborhood, playing with a little boy. But she said he'd recently seemed troubled. Last week, he went out for a drive 'to clear his emotions,' he would later tell police. Before police arrived on scene, a neighbor said that she saw South fighting with a woman in the street in front of her house . He 'was unaware of his surroundings' and careened his truck off Northwestern Parkway in Shawnee, according to court records. He slid down a hill into the Shawnee Golf Course. He tried to drive through the golf course to find an exit, but got stuck in the mud, damaging a green as he tried to drive free. South was cited for criminal mischief and scheduled to appear in court for arraignment later this month. In

"NFL murderer Aaron Hernandez is no longer No 81 - he is Prisoner W106228, Daily Mail Online can reveal. The official number was issued to Hernandez as he started the rest of his life in jail, at Cedar Junction state prison in Massachusetts. He was being moved to the maximum security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center near Shirley today. Hernandez is being held separately from other prisoners and is on suicide watch. He is now equipped with green prison scrubs and his tattoos are being examined for gang affiliations. It can also be disclosed that he was hooked on 'angel dust', a drug known to cause users to experience violent outbursts and paranoia. The former New England Patriots star smoked the hallucination-inducing drug in marijuana cigarettes that are known as 'killer joints' in the world of drugs. Sources said the brute, found guilty of murdering Odin Lloyd, was using the dangerous drug for at least a year before the victim was shot dead. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS .

"An Arizona father of quadruplets whose wife died the same day his children were born says he's doing his best thanks to the help from supporters across the globe. Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona had two of the babies home with him on January 16, and the other two were cleared to leave the hospital on March 11. This after the babies were born premature and, in a tragic twist, his wife Erica, 36, passed away just one day after giving birth of hypovolemic shock which is caused by blood loss. Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Recent widower and father of quadruplets, Carlos Morales, along with his late wife Erica's mother, Sondra Bridges, say they are doing well thanks to help from generous supporters across the globe . Miracle: Even though Erica passed away, Carlos Morales considers the successful birth of his quadruplets a miracle and he is happy to have all four of them at his home . 'We’re just doing our best. I’m feeling really, really grateful for everybody that just came together and helped us,' Carlos told Today,referring to the nearly $350,000 raised on a GoFundMe page set up for the family. Erica's mother, Sondra Bridges, now lives with Morales to help take care of the babies: Tracy, Paisley, Erica and Carlos, Jr. Bridges also gave thanks for the tremendous outpouring of support that the family received. 'It’s funny how things turn out. Bittersweet, but at the same time, thanks to God, and the outpouring support of the public, it’s been phenomenal,' she said. 'And I’d like to say thank you to each and every one of you. All the support we’ve gotten from you, we appreciate it.' Morales is sill mourning the loss of Erica, however, with whom he dreamed of having a big family. The pair had gone through IVF fertility treatment in a desperate attempt to conceive to complete their family. But the last time Mr Morales saw his wife was when she kissed her on the head and said he loved her before going into labor at Banner Good Samaritan Hospital. Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, finally has his newborn quadruplets home with him . Tragic: Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, held the babies - three girls and one boy - after his wife Erica, 36, passed away on January 16. Their mother would never get to meet them . 'Look at these beautiful blessings,' Morales told People. 'Even when they scream their heads off I want to give them the biggest kiss.' He then added; 'I already know their quirky little habits or the next time they're going to cry. They're starting to form their own personalities.' And while he says dealing with four is a lot more difficult than dealing with two, he does have help thanks to his wife's mother-in-law, who moved down to help with the children. The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock, an emergency condition where one experiences a severe

"Sometimes walking in a straight line without tripping over with just two feet is enough of a challenge. So imagine the kind of coordination it would require if you had eight legs. Now scientists have unraveled how octopuses manage to keep track of all of their flailing limbs as they crawl over objects. The video above, recorded by researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, shows how that despite its body orientation (green arrow) the octopus can crawl in any direction (blue arrow) thanks to its flexible arms . Using high speed videos of octopuses as they negotiated obstacles, biologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel studied the cephlopods movement. They found that the orientation of the creature's body and the crawling direction are controlled independently in the brain. Male octopuses have a long, detachable penis in order to mate with females that are five times bigger than itself. When a female swims by, the male Argonaut sends his penis off to swim to the female and mate with her. In fact, the penis is a ball of sperm in a tentacle called a hectocotylus and females can be fertilised by more than one, by storing them in the mantle cavity. The male dies soon after his unique ordeal, whereas the female can mate several times and even store multiple hectocotyli in a special cavity until they’re needed. In the past, scientists that caught female specimens confused the attached penises for parasitic worms. The male mollusc won almost a third of votes in a survey set up by the Society of Biology to identify the strangest animal sex. The thrust comes from arms that push by elongation rather than arms that pull. This combined with they symmetrical arrangement of the arms around the body helps to give the marine creatures their extraordinary maneuverability. It is the first time scientists have been able to fully understand how octopuses are able to control their movements without a rigid skeleton. The findings may help scientists develop new ways for soft robots to move around and can also shed some light on how octopuses evolved in the first place. Professor Binyamin Hochner, who led the research, said: 'Octopuses use unique locomotion strategies that are different from those found in other animals. 'This is most likely due to their soft molluscan body that led to the evolution of 'strange' morphology, enabling efficient locomotion control without a rigid skeleton.' Octopuses are thought to have evolved from clam-like creatures in the mollusc family. But as they lost their hard protective shell, they seem to have evolved to move far faster than other members of the mollusc family like slugs or snails. The octopus was found to move by pushing with its legs rather than pulling while it could move in any direction regardless of the position of its body - something that humans find extremely difficult to do without falling over . Dr Guy Levy, a neurobiologist who also took part in the research at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said: 'During evolution, octopuses lost their heavy

"A Mexican cartel boss known as 'The Liquidator' has been detained by the country's authorities, who claim he is 'linked to the bloodiest events ever recorded in Juarez City'. Mexican federal authorities arrested Juarez Cartel boss Jesus Salas Aguayo on Friday, bringing an end to the career of a criminal who was famed for dispatching his enemies with the use of dynamite. Earning the nickname 'The Liquidator' for the brutal and ruthless methods that earned him a place on the DEA's Most Wanted list, Aguayo is charged with multiple felonies including the distribution of narcotics, homicide and arms trafficking. Scroll down for video . Fearsome: Jesus Salas Aguayo, a former gun for hire and Jarez Cartel boss known for his brutal murders of rivals, was arrested on Friday by Mexican police . Mexican authorities link over twenty deaths directly to The Liquidator, including the 2009 murder of a state witness in El Paso, a 2010 car-bombing which claimed the lives of two federal police officers and a 2012 massacre of fifteen people in a Juarez City bar. In 2008 the Sinaloa Cartel declared war on the Juarez Cartel as it sought to take control of Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million people that sits on the border with El Paso, Texas. That year alone saw 1,600 homicides in the city, and Ciudad Juarez City achieved the title of the most dangerous city in the world for three consecutive years. Jesus Aguayo, also known as 'El Chuyín', led the assault on the invading Sinaloa forces, causing the bloodshed of narcos, Mexican authorities and civilians alike. A respected 'sicario' or hired gun, The Liquidator was known to have spoken of his ambitions to one day run his own drug cartel. In 2008 he was hired by the Juarez Cartel bosses, who sent him to Ciudad Juarez to take over command of La Línea (The Line), the cartel's street-level army of assassins, who were notorious for mutilating the bodies of their enemies and civilians alike. The Jaurez Cartel was formerly one of the most feared in Mexico, but is now all but extinct following a war with the Sinoala cartel, and high profile arrests (pictured, boss Ricardo Gracia Urquiza is arrested in 2005) The Juarez Cartel eventually lost the conflict after three murderous years, and today its agents are spread widely across Chihuahua state. Today Juarez City, once a lively and popular border town, shows the scars of a drug war that cost nearly ten thousand lives over the space of four years. Entire districts of the city are deserted, rare are the buildings not marked with bullet holes and there are sections where even the police dare not enter given the narcos' stranglehold on the territory. The arrest of The Liquidator occurred on Friday in his hometown of Villa Ahumada, some 80 miles south of Ciudad Juarez. A gunfight occurred as the task-force moved in to detain Aguayo and his two bodyguards, one of whom was killed in an exchange of fire.

"A Mexican Mafia hit man convicted of beating and strangling a San Antonio woman because she didn't pay the gang's 10 per cent tax on her illegal drug sales was executed Wednesday evening. The injection of Manuel Vasquez with a lethal dose of pentobarbital leaves Texas with enough of the powerful sedative to carry out only one more execution. Vasquez was the fourth Texas inmate put to death this year, and at least six are scheduled for execution in the coming weeks. Texas prison officials, like those in other death penalty states, have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use. Scroll down for video . Put to death: Gang enforcer Manuel Vasquez, 46, was executed Wednesday for the ordered murder of a San Antonio woman who ignored a 10 per cent street tax on drugs known as a 'dime' Vasquez, 46, was pronounced dead at 6.32pm CDT, 17 minutes after the drug began being administered. Vasquez, in a final statement, told his family and friends he loved them and thanked 'the Lord for his kind mercy, faithfulness and unconditional love.' 'In Jesus' name I pray,' he said, then told the warden: 'I'm ready.' He took three deep breaths, then began snoring loudly. The snores became progressively quiet, and all movement stopped within less than a minute. The sister of his victim was among witnesses watching through a window. He never looked at her. His own sister and a female friend cried as they watched in an adjacent room. Vasquez's lawyers filed no late appeals to delay his execution for the 1998 slaying of 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra. Evidence at Vasquez's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra for ignoring the Mexican Mafia's 10 per cent street tax on drugs — known as a 'dime.' 'I'm sure she was told if you're selling, you've got to pay the tax,' said Mary Green, an assistant Bexar County district attorney who prosecuted Vasquez. 'I guess she didn't take it seriously.' After a night of drinking and drugs at a run-down San Antonio motel, Vasquez and two companions put on bandannas on their facesbarged into the nearby room of Ybarra and her boyfriend, Moses Bazan, early on March 19, 1998, according to evidence presented at his trial. Bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw Ybarra being beaten, heard Vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw Vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle Ybarra. The attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry, stuffed them into a pillowcase and fled. When Bazan regained consciousness, he stumbled to the motel office to summon police. He was able to identify at least one of the attackers, leading to the arrest of all three. One of them, Johnny Joe Cruz, took a plea deal that carried a seven-year sentence and testified against Vasquez. The third man charged, Oligario Lujan, is serving a 35-year prison term.

"A high school journalism teacher has shot dead her former police officer ex-husband after an argument during a messy split, police have said. Cara Ryan, 45, killed John Joseph Rush, also 45, at her home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida around 11pm on Saturday. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office initially said the shooting occurred during a domestic dispute and they did not bring any charges, but on Friday, they said that Ryan had been arrested. The sheriff said he would share more details about the incident at a press conference on Friday afternoon. Gunned down: Cara Ryan, left, shot dead her ex-husband John Joseph Rush, right, on Saturday after an argument at their home. She has now been charged with his murder following an investigation . Authorities previously said they had been arguing before the shooting, Fox 13 reported. The couple, who have a grown daughter together, had divorced in 2003 but then they later moved back in with each other, Fox reported. But Rush's family told the channel that the relationship had soured again in recent months and he had moved out of the home in February. It was not clear why he returned at the weekend. Rush, known to friends as 'JJ', had retired from the St Petersburg Police, where he had worked in the forensic unit, with an injury following an on-duty car crash in 2005. Afterwards he went to work for the county medical examiner's officer, family members said. Sergeant Joe Pratt, who had worked with Rush, said he was stunned that his friend, who had survived working a dangerous job, was ultimately killed at home, WTSP reported. 'Something like this, you just never anticipate, so it's really a shock when something like this happens to someone you know and care about and has been a part of your life the past 25 years,' he said. Split: Ryan, a high school teacher, and Rush, a former cop, had divorced in 2003 but had rekindled and had moved back in together. But their relationship soured again and he moved out last month . Scene: The shooting unfolded following an argument at Ryan's home, pictured, on Saturday night . Shock: Police can be seen responding to the scene in Indian Rocks Beach on Saturday night . Ryan, who owns the home where he was shot, is a media production teacher at Clearwater High School. According to her LinkedIn page, she has been with the school district for two decades. Her Facebook profile features a picture of her and her ex-husband sitting close together and looking into each other's eyes. Another image shows them walking on a beach with their daughter.

What Andrew Chan, then aged 21, and Myuran Sukumaran, 24, came to have in common was the belief that smuggling drugs would provide them with a short cut to the life of ease and glamour and - their biggest mistake - that they could get away with it.

But a glance at their working-class backgrounds would never have led anyone to predict their dismal fate. Chan, the youngest of four children and the son of Chinese immigrants, once described himself as the black sheep of his family.

"Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates . Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season . 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations. 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres . Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time . But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again . 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.

I just wanted to get home, but they didn’t care. I was desperate, I was pleading.' 'My phone wasn’t working and I was all alone. It was only thanks to a lovely couple that I could ring my dad.' Deva Joseph, 14, was left in floods of tears at London Stansted airport (pictured) after being told she would not be allowed to take her flight home to Spain .

Deva's father Stefan Joseph, of Santander, northern Spain, described easyJet as 'a disgrace'. The Daily Mirror reports that the airline has since apologised adding: 'Whilst our policy is not to take cash at the gate, we should have made an exception.'

"Chelsea Manning, the US soldier serving a 35-year prison sentence for a massive document leak, should be addressed in gender-neutral or feminine terms in court documents. Judges made the ruling as Manning continues her transition into a woman. Chelsea, 27, formerly known as Bradley Manning, is incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. She had already secured permission last year to be known under the name 'Chelsea' instead of 'Bradley'. Chelsea Manning, pictured here (center) in 2013 before she began her transition, was known as Bradley when she went on trial for the massive document leak to the WikiLeaks website . Chelsea, 27, pictured here in a wig and lipstick in an undated photograph, is allowed to wear women's underwear, undergo psychotherapy, and has had hormone therapy for gender reassignment approved . The former intelligence analyst had also been allowed to wear women's underwear following a decision last year, and to undergo psychotherapy. The latest move comes a month after the U.S. Army approved hormone therapy for Manning's gender reassignment - a first for the American military. 'All future formal papers filed before this court and all future orders and decisions issued by this court shall either be neutral, e.g. Private First Class Manning or appellant, or employ a feminine pronoun' said a court order on Wednesday. Manning, pictured on stickers worn by a demonstrator, has now won the right to be addressed in gender-neutral or feminine terms in court . However 'in respect to historic fact,' the court will retain masculine wordage used in previous decisions, including Manning's conviction. The news has been welcomed by Manning's defense team. 'The court rightly recognized that dignifying Chelsea's womanhood is not the trivial matter that the government attempted to frame it as,' said Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which was involved in Manning's defense. Manning was convicted in August 2013 of espionage and other offenses after admitting to handing over more than 700,000 classified documents to the WikiLeaks website while stationed in Iraq.

"While Hillary Clinton was using a private email address hosted on her own home-based computer server to conduct State Department business, her agency forced out an ambassador who was doing the same thing overseas. Retired Air Force General Scott Gration was US ambassador to Kenya for 13 months between 2011 and 2012, departing after a scathing performance report blasted his leadership style and determined that he created security risks by running his own one-person IT department. The report determined that Gration 'assumed charge of the mission’s information management operations,' in Nairobi, and 'ordered a commercial Internet connection installed in his embassy office bathroom so he could work there on a laptop not connected to the Department email system.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND GRATION'S PERFORMANCE REPORT . OUSTED: Scott Gration (left) was special envoy to Sudan before he spent 13 months as ambassador to Kenya; he was forced out after an inspector general report found problems with his performance – including the use of unauthorized commercial email services to conduct government business outside of secure channels . EMAIL-GATE: Hillary Clinton never used an official government email address as secretary of state, relying on a private server at the same time her agency was forcing Gration out for, among other things, doing the same . He also tried to legitimize his actions by writing new policy and distributing it to the embassy staff, saying the use of 'commercial email' for government business was acceptable. Gration, the State Department's Office of Inspector General wrote, 'continued to use commercial email for official government business' even when investigators were digging into his conduct. The report noted that he seldom logged on to his official State Department email account; The New York Times later reported that he 'preferred to use Gmail for official business.' Clinton, the odds-on favorite to be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 2016, came under fire this week for using a private email account – not a State Department 'state.gov' address – to conduct government business. Her aides, and Obama administration colleagues – including White House personnel – reached her at 'hdr22@clintonemail.com' for the four years she was America's top diplomat. The revelation has led to accusations that the former secretary failed to turn over all her communications for archiving, as the Federal Records Act requires. Additional questions have swirled around potential national security risks posed by having sensitive material flowing through unsecure channels. Scott Gration lasted just 13 months as an ambassador before his management style and data security breaches ended his State Dept. career . Clinton helmed the State Department through the entirety of Gration's tenure as ambassador. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment about parallels between her case and Gration's. But the 2012 IG report spelled out a policy that it appears Clinton herself failed to follow. 'It is the department's general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,' the report read. 'The use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for

The user wrote: 'So when I saw this picture for the new Pixar movie Inside Out, at first I thought the characters were three women and two aliens, but after seeing the trailer I realized the purple and red things were supposed to be dudes. 'After tracing their faces, I figured out why I was so weirded out: The two male characters have extremely distinctive face shapes, while the three female characters basically have the exact same shape; round with a small nose.

'So, having a film with two hero female characters was really tough, and having them both in the scene and look very different if they’re echoing the same expression; that Elsa looking angry looks different from Anna being angry.' A Disney spokeswoman reacted to the controversy by saying: 'Animation is an intricate and complex art form. 'These comments were recklessly taken out of context.

Nightclub promoters in Magaluf have begun tweeting messages to bring in youngsters this summer . The Carnage Magalluf firm is even trading off the back of events last summer, tweeting: 'Who's ready for the world famous bar crawl starting in April?' The firm's website is now advertising VIP pool parties, jungle sessions and bar crawls alongside images of a barman pouring spirits into a young woman's mouth in a so-called 'dentist's chair' position. It comes as police on the Spanish island are given new powers to seize drinks from tourists on the street between 10pm and 8am. There will also be tougher restrictions bar crawls and fines for 'balconing' - a craze for jumping off hotel balconies which has led to several deaths.

In the first three months of the year, 434,775 people waited longer than four hours in hospital emergency wards - some 4,830 patients every day.

Over the past year, more than 1.4 million people were forced to wait longer than the target time – compared to just 353,000 in 2009/10 . The figures also show that 113,648 waited longer than four-hours on trolleys in A&E, and 983 over 12 hours. It is now 89 weeks since hospital A&Es met their waiting targets. NHS England figures show that 92 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in the week ending March 29. This was down on the previous week when 93.2 per cent were seen within the time limit.

Mr Hunt today vowed to find the cash – but went further by claiming that the Government would find even more cash if they health service needed it. He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'We will back the NHS's own plan in full, so we agree with the £30 billion gap, and we agree with the NHS when they say that if they can make £22 billion of efficiency savings the NHS would need £8 billion. 'But they also said in that plan very clearly that they might need less than £8 billion if they can make more efficiency savings, or they might need more than £8 billion if they can't make those efficiency savings.' He added: 'We will give whatever they need, it might be more than £8 billion, it might be less, but the point is you can only have this discussion if you have a strong and growing economy.'

Head of the US Army General Raymond Odierno, who has warned that cuts to Britain's defence spending could diminish their ability to fight future campaigns . General Odierno, the US army chief of staff, suggested defence cuts had already damaged America’s confidence in their military ally. I would be lying to you if I did not say that I am very concerned about the GDP investment in the UK,’ he told The Daily Telegraph. ‘We have a bilateral agreement between our two countries to work together. It is about having a partner that has very close values and the same goals as we do. ‘What has changed, though, is the level of capability. In the past we would have a British Army division working alongside an American army division. Now it might be a British brigade inside an American division.’ His warning came after the former head of the Army said yesterday that fresh cuts to Britain’s Armed Forces would be ‘unwise’ with the West facing twin dangers of a new Cold War with Russia and the rise of Islamist extremism. Sir Peter Wall (left) and former Defence Secretary (right) are among those to have spoken out against the Chancellor's plan to reduce military spending to below the NATO benchmark of 2 per cent of GDP . In his first interview since retiring last September, General Sir Peter Wall admitted that he doubted UK politicians had the will to ‘tackle the really wicked issues’ facing the world. And the ex-Chief of the General Staff urged all the major political parties to promise to protect defence spending at 2 per cent of national income after the general election. He said a fall in funding would lead to cuts in budgets for training, equipment and even military missions – further undermining the UK’s global standing. The Prime Minister has faced criticism over the cuts which, say experts, would 'comfort enemies' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Sir Peter urged: 'We military folk would like to see manifesto commitments to levels of defence expenditure and it's of concern to us that all parties would probably be content to have this conversation not happening at the moment. 'Implicit in what the current government was saying around the time of the Nato summit in Wales last year where we were suggesting that it was everybody's responsibility around Europe to meet the 2% of GDP for defence expenditure, implicit in that is the fact that that's what we ought to be doing ourselves.' His views were echoed by former Defence Secretary Liam Fox who suggested foreign aid be redirected in order to increase funds. 'To say that we were willing to guarantee a proportion of

"(CNN)One hundred and forty-seven victims. Many more families affected. Even more broken hopes and dreams. As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, killing nearly 70 people.

"Scottish voters would rather have a referendum on the EU than another independence vote, a new survey has revealed. The idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters. It comes after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections. Scroll down for video . Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was campaigning in Aberdeen today ahead of a second TV debate tonight . When questioned on the issue in last night's Scottish leaders TV debate, Ms Sturgeon insisted an SNP victory in the General Election would not trigger another referendum. But she added it was 'another matter' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 Holyrood elections would bring about a second vote on independence. Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately. In last night's TV showdown with the Scottish leaders of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence vote before 2020 . Ms Sturgeon has vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe . The most popular policy was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, which was given a score of 8.2. Giving the Scottish Parliament power over all welfare benefits was eighth most popular, with a score of 7.1, while transferring full responsibility for income tax to Holyrood came 10th on the list at 6.8. Holding another independence referendum by 2020 was given a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies. He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.' Scotland's political leaders, from left to right, Tory Ruth Davidson, Labour's Jim Murphy, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie faced off in a live TV election debate last night . Overall, Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit – but also favour the Government's

He was was told by the judge to get his anger under control and to change his behavior during a hearing on Thursday at Clay Count family court. The teen will be assessed by Missouri youth workers to determine what kind of treatment he will receive while in the custody of the state-run agency, which is for youths placed by juvenile courts, according to the Kansas City Star. Scroll down for video . The 14-year-old student who severely beat a Missouri sixth-grader with Asperger's syndrome will be taken into custody by the state's youth services division for treatment. The teen, whose name has not been released, admitted to striking Blake Kitchen (above), 12, in their school's lunchroom last month . In the February 19 attack, Blake (above) was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School . 'They can pretty much tailor a program to each individual kid based on their needs,' said Janet Rogers, interim juvenile officer for Clay County. 'Their goal is to get these kids turned around so they can make better choices before they hit adulthood.' In the February 19 attack, Blake was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School. Blake has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. His parents said that turned troublesome when last month, a boy moved Blake's belongings from his seat. When Blake asked the boy to move, another boy began hitting him. 'Then I blacked out,' Blake told WDAF. 'My ear hurts, my jaw hurts, my back hurts and that's all.' Blake (pictured left and right) has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. The altercation occurred after some other schoolchildren moved his stuff in the cafeteria one morning . Blake's mother, Destiny, said the boy continued to beat her son even after he had blacked out, but she said luckily he does not remember the attack, according to Fox2Now. 'He doesn't remember any of that. I guess that was a blessing. He was unconscious and doesn't remember being violently attacked. It's sad he didn't stop,' she said. 'Anytime they moved him he would vomit. Dry heaving constantly, just dry heaving. Him crying and saying it was so painful and he was afraid he was going to die. He was like 'I don't want to die'.' Blake spent five days at Children's Mercy Hospital and was later released. His injuries have left him facing a second surgery

After paying world No 1 McIlroy a warm tribute and expressing his delight that he had come to play in the event for the first time, the King was asked about Tiger’s absence, and the fact they supposedly spoke for an hour on the phone.

I still try to exercise three times a week because I think it’s important. Heck, I’m going to get old one of these days and I want to be in shape when it happens.’ Cue more laughter. On the subject of McIlroy, Palmer said: ’I’m so pleased he’s come this year, we’re very happy to have him. And I’ve got a good feeling about Rory this week. I’ve a feeling he’s going to snap to it and play very well.’ McIlroy has had a disappointing time of it so far in Florida.

"Two British men have been fined $3,000 for threatening behaviour on board a Thomson Airways flight. One allegedly threw peanuts and a pound coin at cabin crew, with the other was accused of hitting himself on the head with clenched fists during the disturbance, which forced the flight from London to Mexico to divert to Bermuda. Jamie Richardson, 38, from Lancing, West Sussex and Daniel Taylor, 37, from Worthing, West Sussex, both pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour in a Bermuda court. Scroll down for video . Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda . The two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them. The Royal Gazette reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning. The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head. Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a plane . Richardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner. Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight. The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers. In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally. Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair. 'In these times it could be a lot harsher – you can’t mess around in the air these days,' he said. A statement on the Bermuda Police website read: 'Around 12:55pm on Sunday, April 12 police officers responded to a report of two disruptive passengers on a diverted Thomson Airways flight landing at LF Wade International Airport. 'The two male passengers involved were subsequently escorted off the plane and taken into police custody. 'The Thomson aircraft was apparently en route from London, U.K. to Cancun, Mexico.'

"The US military’s Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (Darpa) says they may have a method to stop all infectious diseases - including Ebola. By encoding RNA and DNA in a specific way, Darpa say a person could simply go into a shop and get an injection to protect them against a disease. This could be used to prevent mass outbreaks in affected areas. US military's Darpa has developed a method to stop infectious diseases. It involves encoding RNA and DNA with instructions for antibodies. A person could then be injected with the antibodies at a pharmacy (stock image shown). This enables a person's cells to fight an infectious disease . ‘We’re going to take the genetic code and put it into a format where you go to your drug store or doctor and get a shot in the arm,’ said Darpa programme manager Dan Wattendorf at an event in San Francisco, reported Fusion. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids. RNA is formed from strings of nucleic acids, the same building blocks that create DNA. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell and RNA is what helps translate it. Some life, like viruses, only use RNA and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on Earth used this molecule. Proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids. These carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick. Lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles. They form the membrane 'walls' of every living cell and give them structure. They are also essential for sending signals out of the cell. ‘There’s a low-cost of goods, no cold chain, and we would produce the correct antibody in [any] individual directly.’ The method works by creating powerful antibodies from survivors of an infectious disease. ‘Instructions’ on how to make these antibodies are then encoded into RNA and DNA, which are injected into people who might come into contact with the disease. Their cells then start creating the antibodies, protecting them from catching the potentially dangerous disease. Darpa is currently funding the project through Emory University in Atlanta. Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu or malaria. Antibodies are typically grown in large vats of mammal cells or in some cases, tobacco plants, such as US pharmaceutical company Mapp Biopharmaceutical's experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp. Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu, malaria and Ebola.

"(CNN)Well, I'll be the first to admit, I got caught off guard on this one. If indeed the assessment of the cockpit voice recording of Germanwings Flight 9525's final moments is an accurate one, it is shocking. It is inconceivable to me that a fellow pilot would use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers. It is my hope that there is more to this uncanny, horrific tragedy than just an extraordinary suicide event. Although a report of normal breathing from the co-pilot in the moments before the crash indicates that he was not incapacitated, how can one really tell? A farfetched idea, but could he have suffered a fit of schizophrenia never diagnosed, or suffered some other mental disorder, perhaps brought on by medication? I know, it's not likely. As an airline pilot, I'm taking this incident personally. Why? A pilot betrayed the public trust. With all the other fears -- terrorism, disappearances of planes, aircraft malfunctions -- how do I reassure my passengers that they should not add medical illness, mental or otherwise, of the pilot to the list? For the moment, I'll have to believe that my customers are intelligent enough to realize that the Germanwings co-pilot is an anomaly. Sure, as with any profession, pilots have isolated cases of stress-related troubles. But we have mechanisms to deal with such problems. One mechanism is very simple: Don't fly. It is incumbent upon us to determine our own fitness for duty. As a matter of fact, on every trip, I have to confirm that status before I electronically sign the flight plan. Whether it's as simple as suffering from the common cold or suffering from the distraction of a nasty divorce, airline pilots can just say ""no"" to flying. As part of the hiring process, we completed a psychological evaluation. With my airline, one part of the evaluation involved a written test that asked obscure questions in different ways. Another part of the test involved pilots listening to an air traffic control recording made during the angst of a thunderstorm event while at the same time completing a battery of math and shape-orientation problems. We were then asked questions specific to the conversations between the air traffic controllers and pilots we'd heard in the recording. The test was a measure of our multitasking abilities and our abilities to deal with stress. In addition, the airline's doctor conducted an individual mental evaluation. Airline pilots in the United States are required by the Federal Aviation Administration to take a medical examination once every six months. The examination is mostly physical, but the doctor is expected to ask some basic mental health questions, most of them about depression or alcohol consumption. In addition to requiring pilots to indicate any prior health issues during the previous six months, the application for the exam also compels us to self-disclose the use of medications, specifically for the treatment of depression. If we have consulted a therapist, that also has to be disclosed. Yes, all bets are off if we deceive the system

"Golden State's Stephen Curry scored 40 points, including a 3-pointer in the final seconds of regulation to complete a 20-point, fourth-quarter comeback that allowed the Golden State Warriors to beat New Orleans 123-119 in overtime Thursday and take a 3-0 lead in their first-round play-off series. The dramatic win by the Warriors was mirrored by Chicago's double-overtime victory over Milwaukee. The Bulls also established a 3-0 series lead, as did Cleveland against Boston. Curry hit seven 3s in all, including one to start overtime that gave the Warriors the lead for good.

Klay Thompson had 28 points for the Warriors, who trailed 89-69 after three quarters, then outscored New Orleans 39-19 over the next 12 minutes. Anthony Davis had 29 points and 15 rebounds for the Pelicans, but his missed free throw with 9.6 seconds left allowed Curry's late 3 to tie it. Curry missed a 3-point attempt in the final seconds of regulation, but Marreese Speights corralled the rebound and handed it to Curry in the corner, and the Warriors' leader wasn't going to miss twice. Davis had a chance to tie it in the final seconds of overtime, but Warriors center Andrew Bogut forced him into a difficult driving shot, which missed badly. The Warriors go for the sweep on Saturday in New Orleans. No NBA team has ever overcome a 3-0 deficit to win a playoff series. Chicago are also on course for a sweep after a 113-106 double overtime win against Milwaukee. Derrick Rose scored 34 points and Jimmy Butler added 24 for the Bulls. Butler's steal and layup started an 8-0 run that gave Chicago a 109-101 lead with 2:44 left in the second overtime. Rose scored six points in the second overtime, including a layup off an offensive rebound with 2:15 left for a 10-point lead.

"Die-hard fans of the hit BBC series Poldark aren’t just flocking to Cornwall as tourists, as interest in the programme has spurred demand for holiday homes along the county’s picturesque coastline. A beachfront property with spectacular views has gone on the market for £3million, and it is already drawing interest from viewers who are enamoured with the series’ stunning setting – and actor Aidan Turner’s chiselled looks. Since the series started airing last month estate agents said they have seen a rise in enquiries about the cottage, overlooking an ancient smugglers’ cove on Cornwall’s north coast, and other properties where the title character, Ross Poldark, plies his trade. Scroll down for video . A beachfront property with summer and winter cottages (middle, bottom left) has gone on the market for £3million in Cornwall . The property has stunning views of Smugglers Cove, and the summer and winter cottages are linked via a lift (pictured: summer cottage) Poldark actor Aidan Turner has become a heartthrob for fans after his character took off his shirt on the popular BBC One show . Ben Standen, from estate agents Jackson-Stops & Staff of Truro, said Smugglers Cottage in Smugglers Cove, near Portreath, has a summer and winter cottage, cleverly linked via a lift. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the property has direct access to the beach and an amazing view of uninterrupted coast and open sea. The summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four, and they can be used separately to provide lots of space for a family.

"Patients at a hospital A&E department are being forced to parade details of their conditions on laminated signs. They are assessed by staff when they arrive, then given a red card if their illness is serious or a green one for less urgent issues, with a two or three-word summary of their ailment. These are designed to speed up staff assessments as patients wait for treatment, but the trial scheme has been described as ‘insensitive’ and like ‘a police line-up’. Elizabeth Reid, 49, has criticised a hospital after she was forced to wear a sign detailing her condition while waiting for treatment . It means those with alcohol, mental health and gynaecological problems, and others who might prefer to keep their conditions private, could be at risk of losing patient confidentiality. Elizabeth Reid, 49, said she was appalled when she went to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, and was given a green card detailing her ankle injury after she was assessed by a nurse. ‘I didn’t mind much for me as I had hurt my ankle,’ she added. ‘But I thought it was disgusting that patients with alcohol problems or mental health issues had to carry cards that showed everyone what was wrong with them.’ The mother of five from Chelmsford has complained to hospital bosses about the scheme. She said for those ‘carrying signs saying they had alcohol problems, it just smacked of them being marked out – it was like a police line-up’. Mrs Reid added: ‘The poor man in front of me was looking after his teenage daughter, who had alcohol poisoning, and everyone could see what was wrong with her. ‘I could see why every single person in the queue was there – and we had to wait in a line that went past lots of people sitting down waiting, so they could all see what was wrong with us too. It’s really poor for patient confidentiality.’ Hospital bosses at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, said it was designed to speed up staff assessments . She suggested it would be possible to obscure the details written on the cards, leaving the colour visible for staff, but said patients coming into A&E might be too distressed or distracted to think of doing this. ‘The people who come in are panicking or in pain,’ she added. ‘They could see anyone they know as it’s a local hospital, and they have to carry these cards showing what’s wrong with them.’ Another woman who visited the hospital said: ‘I had a laminated card and actually laughed at the insensitivity. I had a very negative experience, having just moved here from another county, and as a nurse myself was quite disheartened with the overall care I received at a sensitive time to myself and my family.’ The trust responsible for the hospital has defended the scheme, saying it will lead to quicker assessment times. The trial scheme has been described as ‘insensitive’ and like ‘a police line-up’ (picture posed by models) Dr Donald McGeachy, medical director of the Mid-Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, said:

"Researchers found women judged to have pretty faces also have voices regarded by men as appealing (file picture) Men can judge how attractive a woman is by hearing her talk, according to a study. Researchers found women judged to have pretty faces also have voices regarded by men as appealing. ‘People can make quite reliable guesses about women’s facial attractiveness on the basis of their voices,’ said study co-author Markus Koppensteiner, an anthropologist from the University of Vienna. He added: ‘Attractive voices may create an idea about what a woman will look like.’ Researchers photographed the faces and recorded the voices of 42 women with an average age of 24. They then asked a group of men – with an average age of mid 20s – to rate the women’s voices on attractiveness and another group of similar age to judge the attractiveness of their faces. Those rated highly for looks often scored well for sound too, with the study finding a ‘significant relationship between males’ ratings of female faces and voices. Findings suggest that women with an attractive face also tend to have an attractive voice’. The scientists also mapped the shape, size and layout of the women’s faces to work out which facial traits were considered to be more attractive both physically and vocally. They found women deemed the most attractive tended to have ‘lifted jawbones, less robust jaws and fuller lips’. The research could shed light on the visual and vocal appeal of radio broadcasters such as Fearne Cotton. Mr Koppensteiner added: ‘It could explain why women who have made it (on radio) also have attractive faces.’ Previous research has indicated women also pay close attention to men’s voices, preferring a deeper pitch because they associate it with a larger body size.

"(CNN)Even if you're sweating on the treadmill and grunting at the weight machine, you're probably still forgetting 57 important muscles that define part of who you are and how others perceive you and even help manage your mental well-being. They're in your face. Face Love Fitness, a pop-up boutique in downtown Manhattan, offers face workouts and massages to keep the skin and muscles of the face and neck healthy, looking young and feeling good. ""The popular notion that one should avoid touching one's face for fear of creating wrinkles is completely incorrect. Skin responds beautifully to mindful touch,"" says Rachel Lang, an esthetician (skin care therapist), who co-founded the Face Love skin gym with massage therapist Heidi Frederick and personal trainer Kate Gyllenhaal. Not all skin experts agree. Some dermatologists, including Dr. Patricia K. Farris, a clinical associate professor at Tulane University, say that exercising facial muscles is counterintuitive to dermatologists. They treat lines and wrinkles caused by facial muscle movement, called dynamic wrinkles, with the muscle relaxing medication botulinum toxin, commonly known by the brand name ""Botox."" ""I do think there could be some value to relaxation and stress relief provided by massage, but exercising facial muscles will not make you look younger and may even make you look older,"" says Farris. But proponents of massage say healthy, youthful skin is well-worked skin. ""When you stimulate pressure receptors under the skin, as you do in a moderate pressure massage, you increase the temperature of the skin, you slow down the physiology, you reduce the release of stress hormones and enhance immune function"" according to Tiffany Field, Ph.D., director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine. ""Just as massage and exercise contributes to health in general, it would also be expected to contribute to skin health."" This is the philosophy at the skin gym, where they say the massage and movement is detoxifying and increases oxygen and blood circulation to the skin, which can result in fewer wrinkles, a firmer jaw line, improved skin tone, and even reduced headaches and eyestrain, according to Lang. ""It is like any exercise, you need to do it two to three times a week for the best results."" It may look a little silly, contorting your facial expressions as Lang drags a plastic roller across your face, or trying to lift your eyebrows against the resistance of an elastic band across your forehead, but the effect of working out your face is pleasantly refreshing. Under the skin there is an area of fatty tissue called the subcutaneous layer. It diminishes with age. The loss of this area contributes to decreased firmness, giving facial skin an older, tired look. Exercising the facial muscles tones and lifts the skin because your facial muscles are attached to your skin and the bone like a web that forms the shape of your face. Through the massages and resistance training, Face Love Fitness claims muscles in the face become stronger and taut, rejuvenating the appearance of the face. ""This is great for everyone, it doesn't

"(CNN)Adi Shankar had the idea for ""Power/Rangers"" when he was 7 years old. ""This was before the Internet, and my access to TV and video games was pretty limited,"" the producer recalled Thursday, in the midst of the ""Power/Rangers"" frenzy. ""So all you really had was (to) tell people stories. So I'd tell people 'Captain Planet' stories, and then I started telling them these dark 'Power Ranger' stories. ""And I got into trouble,"" he added. ""Because the parents were like, 'This guy, he's ruining our children!' "" That was more than 20 years ago for Shankar. But the producer, now 30, got his wish when his dark version of the ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" directed by friend Joseph Kahn, made it online -- and proceeded to rack up more than 11 million views on YouTube in less than two days. Fans buzzing over bloody 'Power/Rangers' 'bootleg' In some ways, Shankar is still getting into trouble. Not only did the video explode the Power Rangers mythology, showing the impact of serving as ""child soldiers,"" in Shankar's phrase, but the video became a legal football after the owner of the franchise, Saban Entertainment, claimed infringement. First it was taken down from Vimeo and then YouTube. However, it was reposted in both places late Friday after lawyers reached agreement, Deadline reported. Among the additions: a disclaimer from Shankar that his ""bootleg"" is ""my take on the FAN FILM. Not a pilot, not a series, not for profit, strictly for exhibition. This is a bootleg experiment not affiliated or endorsed by Saban Entertainment or Lionsgate nor is it selling any product. I claim no rights to any of the characters (don't send me any money, not kickstarted, this film is free)."" Saban Entertainment has its own plans to reboot the popular '90s franchise with a theatrical film scheduled for 2016. 'An interesting experiment' So who are these guys, anyway? Kahn is a famed music video director, probably best known for Britney Spears' ""Toxic,"" Eminem's ""Without Me"" (for which he won a Grammy) and Taylor Swift's ""Blank Space."" He's also handled a number of commercials and the films ""Detention"" and ""Torque."" Shankar is a producer of such films as ""The Grey,"" ""Killing Them Softly"" and ""Dredd."" This isn't the first time he's made a ""bootleg"" short. Previous videos have included one featuring Marvel's Punisher character and one drawing from Marvel's Venom character. In a Reddit AMA, Kahn said that ""Power/Rangers"" was ""self-funded."" A special effects house, Ingenuity Engine, ""worked six months on this and took a bath financially,"" he added. Shankar declined to give a budget for ""Power/Rangers,"" which was shot over a few days last year, but says it was mainly financed through favors and the principals' money. ""It was all favors,"" he says, noting that star James Van Der Beek ""is one of my best friends."" The film also starred ""Battlestar Galactica's"" Katee Sackhoff. Both Shankar and Kahn like to subvert concepts and cliches. Kahn said he was drawn to ""Power/Rangers"" because ""it was an interesting experiment to play with reboot culture and tone control.

"The chairman of the House Oversight Committee is issuing subpoenas to two Secret Service agents who witnessed an episode in which two allegedly intoxicated agency officials drove through a secure area at the White House, interrupting a bomb investigation. Oversight Committee head Jason Chaffetz said the agents can shed light not only on the March 4 incident, 'but also on why the Secret Service appears to be systemically broken and in desperate need of both leadership and reform.' Chaffetz had asked Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to allow four agents and officers to testify at a hearing last week on the March 4 incident.

Jason Chaffetz, is issuing subpoenas to two Secret Service agents who witnessed an episode in which two allegedly intoxicated agency officials drove through a secure area at the White House, interrupting a bomb investigation . Chaffetz had asked Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to allow four agents and officers to testify at a hearing last week on the March 4 incident. Clancy declined the request and instead testified as the sole witness. Clancy is pictured here at the hearing . The committee is trying to get to the bottom of allegations that two senior agents had been drinking when they drove into the area and nudged a construction barrier with their vehicle as they intruded on the investigation of a suspicious item. Chaffetz said the committee's top priority in its review of the incident is to ensure that the Secret Service keeps the president and his family safe. But he also wants the agency to be transparent. The Republican lawmaker said Department of Homeland Security, the parent organization of the Secret Service, 'requested that information remain secret and be kept from Congress and the American people.' 'Those restrictions are unacceptable. Under such restrictions, the Committee cannot perform its essential duties to evaluate and propose much-needed legislative reforms for this troubled agency,' Chaffetz said. Clancy has been criticized for the agency's handling of the incident and has complained that he was not told about it for five days, which he called unacceptable. He said he only learned about the misbehavior from discussions about an anonymous email that was circulating within the agency. The email described the off-duty agents as 'both extremely intoxicated' and confused about the investigation activity. It said uniformed Secret Service officers at the scene 'were going to arrest both of them, but the UD (Uniform Division) watch commander said not to.' Because Clancy was not made aware of the incident for several days, he was unable to keep surveillance footage that could have shed further light on the matter from being destroyed. It is Secret Service policy to toss out tapes after 72 hours. The only videos that remain from the night in question are those taken of the investigation into the suspected bomb and they do not give a complete picture of what happened after the agents bumped into the barrier.

The ABC have reported that those who receive Centrelink payments made up half of Radio Rental's income last year. Of the $197 million of revenue they made, $90 million came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay. Rental company Radio Rentals has been getting nealry half of its yearly revenue from Centrelink . Centrelink's service, Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service that helps to manage welfare funds . Of that $90 million in expenditure, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, smart phones, sound systems and other home theatre devices. The shocking reality is that the consumer leasing company relies on revenue from the Australian welfare system. A report released by finance company Credit Suisse has expressed that any change in the rules that regulate the consumer leasing industry would have a huge effect on Radio Rentals and their business. Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service offered by Centrelink and deducts welfare payments in manageable amounts in order to pay nominated bills. Those bills can be toward rent, electricity, gas, water, ambulance or medical services and many more. This service aims to make budgeting easier for customers and caters to rental companies as it encourages smaller, broken up bills. Of the $90 million in expenditure, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen TVs .

At 68 and after a full and varied career which has taken in modeling for Vogue, an Oscar-nomination and countless Emmys for her hit TV show Murphy Brown, Candice Bergen says she is happy being fat and now lives to eat. In her new memoir, A Fine Romance, the living legend estimates she has put on 30 pounds in the past 15 years, but says she simply doesn't care. 'In the past 15 years... I have put on 30 pounds. I live to eat. None of this ""eat to live"" stuff for me. I am a champion eater. No carb is safe — no fat, either,' she readily admits. 'At a recent dinner party I shared bread and olive oil, followed by chocolate ice cream with my husband. A woman near me looked at me, appalled, and I thought, ""I don't care,""' she writes. Women over 50 typically have to choose between preserving either their face or their butts and she writes that she has happily chosen the former. 'Dieting is out of my purview,' she confesses. 'I crave cookies... all the things that dilate my pupils.' Her skinny friends and their constant battles to remain thin only reinforce her belief that she is doing what is right for her. 'They maintain their weight by routinely vomiting after major meals consisting of a slice of steak or a filet of fish,' she writes. 'I am incapable of this.' In her new book, A Fine Romance, Candice Bergen talks at her joy at playing feisty TV reporter Murphy Brown for 10 seasons. 'She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless,' she writes . The brutally honest appraisal of her current weight is just one of the topics up for discussioin in her new book, which comes out on April 7, reports Vogue. The follow-up to her 1984 memoir Knock Wood, A Fine Romance focuses on her 15-year marriage to French director Louis Malle who died of cancer in 1995 and her career-defining role as funny, feisty career woman and TV news reporter Murphy Brown. The hit TV show ran for ten seasons between 1989 and 1998 and Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five. After her fifth win, Bergen declined future nominations for the role. Initially she writes that she wasn't thrilled at the idea of acting in a TV show, but after reading the script she realized it was 'written for me.' 'The lead was a television news reporter.

Nick Knight says the renowned designer invited him to take the snaps at his iconic McQueen Black Event in 2004. The London show featured an atmospheric showcase of black pieces, some from the archive and others designed specifically for the night. Scroll down for video . Fashion photographer Nick Knight has created a stunning series of images created from backstage photographs of Alexander McQueen's 2004 show . Now using material he shot backstage at the event, Mr Knight has now created the unique image called Black, collating the previously unseen photographs of 35 outfits modelled by Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Gemma Ward and Lily Cole among others. Mr Knight says he was asked by McQueen to photograph each model backstage with a view to creating a composite image for the future, and now, more than a decade later, the designer’s vision has now been realised. Mr Knight said: ‘As a close collaborator and friend of McQueen, I had the honour of filming many of his photo shoots from the mid-Nineties onwards.’ 'McQueen was so excited as he neared the completion of the collection for the American Express Black event, he insisted we found a way to shoot it behind the scenes at Earls Court where the show was being held. 'He knew the Black Event was an important moment that should be preserved and shown to the world, so this project has been a great way for me to reflect upon and celebrate our working relationship.

"(CNN)Gareth Bale scored twice for Wales as they beat Israel 3-0 in Euro 2016 qualification, taking them to the top of their group and on course for a first major finals since the 1958 World Cup. The Real Madrid striker dominated the game in the northern city of Haifa, setting up Arsenal's Aaron Ramsay for the first goal before scoring twice in the second half to help Wales easily beat an Israel team who had been early pacesetters in the group. Club v country . Much of the build up had focused on Bale. After an impressive first season at Madrid he has come under attack in the Spanish press for putting country before club. He was awarded 0/10 by Spanish newspaper Marca following Barcelona's recent 2-1 El Clasico win and saw two fans attack his car as he left the ground after the match. But Bale didn't appear to be showing any signs of rust as he took Israel apart, a team that hadn't lost a competitive game in two and a half years. ""To come out on top is amazing. The first half was very hard. We did a lot of running, closed them down well, and luckily got the goal which gave us a lot of confidence,"" Bale told British broadcaster Sky Sports after the game. ""We came out in the second half buzzing and showed what a good team we are."" he added. Italy, Czech Republic held . Meanwhile Italy narrowly avoided defeat against Bulgaria. A flurry of first half goals in Sofia had given Bulgaria a 2-1 lead, a lead they looked to have held on to. But late in the game Brazilian-born striker Eder scored on his debut to spare Italy's blushes. The Czech Republic also narrowly avoided defeat, against lowly Latvia.

"Sian Gibson, 51 (pictured), consulted her GP about an unusual freckle she found on her ankle . As a redhead, 51-year-old Sian Gibson was used to having freckles — they’d covered her arms, face and chest since childhood. But in 2008, she noticed a new freckle, darker than usual and larger — the size of a small fingernail — on her ankle. ‘I don’t have many freckles on my legs, so I noticed it straight away,’ says Sian, a mother of three and grandmother of five. ‘My GP told me it was nothing and not to worry about it. But, of course, I did. At the time, there was a campaign about the importance of early detection of skin cancer. Every time I caught sight of the freckle, I would be reminded of how much I wanted to be around for my family.’ However, instead of returning to her GP to ask for a hospital appointment, Sian, from Boston, Lincolnshire, turned to her mobile phone for medical advice. ‘I’d recently got an iPhone and was downloading the apps that were just becoming available,’ she says. ‘One evening, I searched online for “large freckle” and found my way to a free app that claimed to be a mole evaluator that would identify at-risk moles. I thought: “Why not? What have I got to lose?” ’ Sian was ahead of the times. Apps, short for applications — programs that can be downloaded to run on a smartphone — were few and far between in 2008. Today, they’ve become essential to most people’s lives. With 100,000 health apps available in Britain and more launching every week, the medical sector is a market leader — with apps to track calories consumed and kilometres jogged, give first aid advice, provide cognitive behavioural therapy for phobias and remind people to take medication. One in five health apps claims to support a diagnosis, as with Sian’s mole app. One program turns your mobile phone into an electrocardiogram, tracking heart rhythms and emailing the results to a doctor, while others allow patients to record blood pressure or blood sugar. In 2013, the global market for health apps was worth $2.4 billion, according to market research firm research2guidance — and this is predicted to rise to $26 billion by 2017. The NHS has launched the Health and Symptom Checker, and the use of apps in the health service is only set to increase. Last week, it emerged that the NHS is now helping to launch apps to help people cope with depression. ‘We know people are more likely to make healthy choices if they can set their own goals,’ says Bradford GP Dr Shahid Ali, professor of digital health at Salford University. ‘And there’s evidence that with health apps, people are able to have a more grown-up relationship with their doctors and nurses.’ A handful of GPs have welcomed the technology to their practices. Dr Jagdeesh Dhaliwal, a GP in Walsall, West Midlands, says three or four of the 40 or so patients he sees a day bring along their phones

"Scientists claim they are one step closer to creating a drug that can cure HIV. A team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor-like machinery to recognise the HIV virus. In their tests, they found that the technique could completely remove up to 72 per cent of cells that had been infected with HIV. A team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor-like machinery to recognise the HIV virus (pictured) CRISPR technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code . Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the Crispr system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. The DNA cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally, for instance after chronic sun exposure. But unlike UV rays that can result in genetic alterations, the Crispr system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome. When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome. 'Evolution has led to some of the most astonishing mechanisms for protecting organisms against their natural pathogens,' says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor of Salk's Gene Expression Laboratory in California. 'Understanding the immune responses by which bacteria protect themselves against viral infections has allowed us to engineer novel platforms for the targeting of devastating viruses, such as HIV, in human patients.' When a copy of the HIV virus sneaks into a human cell, it can cause havoc. It takes control of the cell's own molecular machinery to made copies of the virus's genetic material and then buries these copies in the cell's own genes. From there, the host's cell becomes an HIV factory, making new copies of the virus to spread throughout the body. Existing HIV drugs target individual steps of this lifecycle; some stop the virus from integrating into cells' DNA, for instance, while others try to stop the affected cells from producing more virus. The problem with these drugs, explains Hsin-Kai Liao, a research associate in the Izpisua Belmonte lab, is that they don't actually remove the copies of the virus that are hidden within cells' DNA. These copies can remain dormant for years and then activate again. 'Patients normally need to take drugs every day or every week for their whole lives, because of the HIV that can be latent,' says Professor Liao. 'This costs money, time and effort.' To combat this problem, the team turned to a molecular defence system called CRISPR that bacteria use to cut up foreign DNA at specified spots. Since its recent discovery, scientists have started using CRISPR to edit genes. But the researchers were also intrigued by its defensive ability and wondered if CRISPR could be programmed to slice and destroy viruses inside human cells. The new Salk study showed that the method is effective against active, full-length HIV rather than a shortened, inactive version of the virus. Pictured

"We all know the time-consuming hassle of having to hoover the house, so it is perhaps no surprise to find that sailors on board this Russian aircraft carrier also got bored of sweeping the decks. What is perhaps more surprising is their solution to the problem, which involved strapping an old jet engine to the front of a tractor, and using the contraption as a huge leaf-blower. The crew of the Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's largest warship, came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing. Russian sailors on board the Admiral Kuznetsov, the country's largest aircraft carrier, have come up with an inegnious way of cleaning the decks, by strapping an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor . Debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines, so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck, but the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother . Even a single stray nut or bolt, if sucked into one of the fighter plane's engines, could spell disaster for the pilot, and cause millions of dollars worth of damage. Usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects, using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up. But with 14,700sq ft of deck space to check and recheck every single day, the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother, and took a more direct approach. According to blog Foxtrot Alpha, the sailors have attached an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor, before fitting the front end with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the ship's deck. The vehicle is then driven up and down the 1,000ft-long deck, blowing all debris overboard. The massive Kuznetsov is the jewel in President Putin's military fleet, carrying a total of 18 fighter jets and 17 anti-submarine helicopters. The ingenious crew members fitted the old MiG engine with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the deck, and use the contraption like an enormous leaf blower, sending debris overboard . The Kuznetsov has a deck spanning 14,700sqft, so rather than search the entire thing by hand, Russian sailors built themselves a giant leaf-blowing machine instead . Bristling with anti-aircraft cannons, rocket batteries, gatling guns and underwater missiles, it weighs in at 43,000 tons and carries 1,690 crew. However, that is nothing compared to the US Nimitz Class aircraft carriers, the tenth and last of which, the George HW Bush, was commissioned in 2009. The ship weighs 102,000 tons, is powered by two on board nuclear reactors and is capable of carrying almost 6,000 crew and air company who pilot its 90 aircraft and helicopters. The UK's largest carrier in the HMS Queen Elizabeth, weighing in at 65,00 tonnes, it carries 40 jets and helicopters, along with 1,600 crew.

"A Russian man who killed his estranged wife by throwing petrol over her and setting her alight while she was at work in a supermarket has been jailed. Shocking CCTV images of the attack that shows the 25-year-old victim going up in flames and running through the store caused outrage across Russia, and led to widespread calls for a crackdown on violence against women.

"A shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya has been released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the west of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. This follows another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film. It raises fears that ISIS is consolidating its presence on the 'doorstep of Europe', as Libya is just a few hundred miles from the coast of Italy. Scroll down for video . Thirty Ethiopian Christians appear to have been beheaded and shot by ISIS in a sickening new propaganda video. Above, at least 16 men are marched down a beach in Libya by militants before they are killed . Ethiopia was unable to confirm its citizens were killed in the footage but condemned the 'atrocious act', a government official said. The video shows the men at the coast wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits and being held at the neck by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces. The victims inland are forced to kneel as militants dressed in combats and green masks stand behind them holding rifles. It starts with what it called a 'history of Christian-Muslim relations', which includes scenes of militants destroying churches, graves and icons. A masked fighter in black then brandishes a pistol as he vows to kill Christians if they do not convert. In an apparent reference to Ethiopia's attacks on neighbouring Somalia, whose population is almost entirely Muslim, he says: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again.' The footage, which was released on websites and social media accounts officially linked to ISIS, also cuts to Christians in Syria explaining how they were given the choice of converting to Islam or paying a 'special tax'. At the end it switches between the two sets of captives - thought to be mainly migrant workers - with one group shot dead at point-blank range and the others beheaded on the beach. The video has not yet been verified. The men - wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits - are held at the neck and forced to kneel by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces . The men, thought to be migrant works, are described by Islamic State in the video as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church' The footage also shows around 12 men being shot in a desert area, believed to be in the south of the country, by militants wearing green balaclavas and combats .

"The appliance of science behind Ronny Deila’s Celtic reign was there for all to see on Sunday afternoon. Any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as Aberdeen’s resistance. Despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding, frustrating 90 minutes against Inter Milan three days previously – and the associated, sleep-disturbing travelling – Deila’s team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4-0 victory. It was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus. The Norwegian’s insistence that Celtic could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure. It was interpreted – or perhaps misinterpreted – as a slight on predecessor Neil Lennon. Ronny Deila's Celtic side are starting to become formidable under the Norwegian's reign at Parkhead . But this much is clear. Deila has unquestionably made the Parkhead side more formidable in that regard. And he has all the stats to back it up. Including one which earned recent arrival Gary Mackay-Steven a rapid (in more ways than one) gold star. Crunching the numbers after matches is an important aspect of Deila’s work when it comes to assessing various aspects of his players’ performances. To the 39-year-old, these reams of figures produced by the technology at Celtic’s disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion. The hope is that it leads to better decisions. Again, there would have been a few from the football old-school previously willing to raise an eyebrow at such talk. But what happened at the weekend provided a riposte to any sneers. Deila (centre) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics . ‘I think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective,’ said Deila. ‘There are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results, but I think we have had six victories after coming home from European games. That’s really good. You don’t see that around the other European leagues. Inter Milan lost at the weekend and they are struggling a lot when they come back — so we did well to win in that way. ‘The amount of metres and sprints on Sunday was unbelievable when you consider we played three days before. We have increased the high-intensity running by 30-40 percent since the summer. That is a lot. Gary Mackay-Steven (right) ran an impressive 1300 metres against Aberdeen on Sunday . ‘We want to be direct, we want to create things, we want to have penetration, we want to be a high-pressing team, so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform.’ Asked if he knew which of his players topped the various statistic tables, Deila broke into a grin. ‘I know everything about the players,’ he laughed. ‘When we played Inter at home, their striker, Rodrigo Palacio, ran 1250 metres at

"Los Angeles (CNN)No one knew him by his real name. But on the harsh streets of Skid Row that became his home, he was known as Africa. Surveillance footage, police and homeless community activists paint wildly different pictures of the man -- one who could be violent, benevolent, troubled and altruistic. Africa was shot and killed by Los Angeles police Sunday after he scuffled with officers. The shooting, caught on video, has renewed accusations of police brutality because it showed him already on the ground. Police say he tried to reach for an officer's gun. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has identified Africa, but is not releasing his real name pending notification of relatives. Africa came to the United States from the continent about a decade ago, said a friend who would only be identified as Nick G. Like Africa, Nick had also been homeless on the streets of Skid Row -- a decrepit area wrought with poverty and despair. ""He wanted to get away from here, he wanted to go back home,"" Nick said. ""He was very depressed. Very, very depressed. He had a good side to him, a good heart."" Africa kept a tent outside the Union Rescue Mission homeless shelter. Even though the shelter was right in front of him, he didn't want the help. Instead, Africa often helped the shelter's employees. ""Our cleaning guys -- he would help them organize cleaning of (the) sidewalk,"" said the Rev. Andy Bales, the shelter's CEO. He described Africa as gentle and kind -- but with an erratic side. ""I attribute the erratic behavior to this difficult environment out here."" Less than an hour before he was killed Sunday, a nearby security camera showed Africa apparently dealing drugs -- the sad and only real currency of Skid Row's economy. The footage then shows Africa getting into a fight with the man in the orange tent next to him, violently tipping the tent and kicking the man. Police arrive and talk to Africa, but he jumps into the tent -- prompting officers to draw their guns. Africa then jumps out, swinging his arms at police. Los Angeles police say he tried to grab an officer's gun, and that's when he was shot. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck called the incident ""an extreme tragedy."" ""We feel great compassion in the LAPD for people who live in conditions of homelessness, and often mental illness, with no treatment,"" Beck said. ""We prepare our officers to deal as best they can with them, but the reality is this is much more than a problem that the police alone can solve."" Bales said the dismal conditions of LA's Skid Row makes it a tinder box for more problems. ""There is no other major city in the U.S. that has a skid row like ours,"" he said. ""2,000 human beings living on the street. Until we deal with that, we're going to continue to have an explosive situation."" On the sidewalk where Africa was shot, a modest memorial sits atop a small pile of belongings. ""RIP Cameroon,""

"A debate between two Oklahoma roommates about whether an iPhone is better than an Android ended in a violent brawl with a stabbing and assault using beer bottles. Jiaro Mendez and Elias Acevedo were both found to be 'highly intoxicated' by Tulsa police following the fight that broke out in the parking lot of their shared apartment on April 14 around 1am. The men were arguing over which phone was better, police said.

It was not revealed in the report which of the men was a fan of the iPhone or the Android. 'It was a petty argument over their cell phones which one was better than the other.

At the press conference yesterday, Mr Tsipras also renewed the demand for war reparations, saying: ‘We must work on the issue of forced loans and Second World War reparations.’ However Mrs Merkel said she viewed the demands as an attempt to distract from the need for economic reforms, adding: ‘The issue of war reparations is closed from a political and legal point of view.

"Taxpayers are having to find £11billion a year to top up the wages of millions of people working in supermarkets and other low paid jobs. The money, which amounts to a massive public subsidy for the companies involved, is paid to some 5.2million workers in the form of tax credits and other benefits. Campaigners say the figures shine a light on how companies making huge profits are relying on the taxpayer to ensure their staff have enough money to put food on the table. The total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax, according to the study by Citizens UK. Critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages . The charity is campaigning for the adoption of the Living Wage - £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 for the rest of the UK - across both the public and private sector. It estimates this would reduce the need for in-work benefits by £6.7bn a year, which would make a massive dent in the £12billion reduction in welfare spending which the Conservatives say is necessary. The current minimum wage for those over 21 is £6.50 an hour and will rise to £6.70 in October, but this is well below what the Government accepts is needed by many people, particularly those with children, to make ends meet. The charity’s report complains: ‘The public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages.’ Its report says Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s posted combined profits of £3.9bn last year, but between them cost the taxpayer more than £750m in benefits paid to their staff. Tesco paid £519m in tax but received £364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers. Asda spent £150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received £221m in benefits. Morrisons’ tax bill was £62m while its 83,000 low-paid workers received £190m in benefits and Sainsbury’s paid £180m in tax, almost exactly as much as its low-paid staff received from the public purse. Of all the profitable companies examined by the charity, Next had the highest average subsidy of £2,087 per head given its high proportion of young employees who are typically paid just above the minimum wage of £6.70 an hour. Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’ Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’.

Raising wages too fast will simply reduce employment opportunities,’ he said.

"Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has heaped praise on Radamel Falcao, claiming his international team-mate can be an 'amazing player' for Manchester United. The shot-stopper will be in Arsenal's FA Cup squad to face United on Monday night, and despite it being unclear whether he or Wojciech Szczesny will start in goal, Ospina will be making sure his team-mates are well aware of Falcao's threat. 'We haven't spoken about the match but we are in contact and I am absolutely convinced and can say with all confidence that Falcao is a player with a winning attitude, he has a strong mentality and is a great professional,' Ospina told the Evening Standard. Radamel Falcao has failed to impress at Manchester United after scoring just four goals in 20 matches . Falcao's international team-mate David Ospina (right) has praised the striker, calling him a 'great professional' 'He has demonstrated that in every team he has ever played in. When he has stability and continuity, he will come to the forefront and he is going to be an amazing player for Manchester United,' Ospina continued. 'We will never underestimate him. He is an excellent forward and I will hope to stop him scoring any goals against us if I play.' Ospina has been instrumental in Arsenal's recent run of form, nailing down the No 1 spot for Arsene Wenger's side. Manchester United are undecided on whether to give Falcao a permanent deal when his loan spell ends . Ospina believes that Falcao (left) can be an 'amazing player' for United if he is given the chance . Despite this, Szczesny was in goal for the Gunners' previous two FA Cup ties and has recovered from an illness which ruled him out of the previous match. Whoever is given the nod is likely to face an out-of-sorts Falcao, who is running out of time to prove himself in the red of Manchester United. The Colombian striker, who plays with Ospina for his country, joined United on deadline day last September in a loan move worth £6million, but is yet to secure a permanent contract. It is believed that the club are as yet undecided on whether to trigger a permanent £43m deal, after Falcao's indifferent form has produced just four goals in 20 matches. Falcao and Ospina have history, as they both play international football for Columbia . Falcao celebrates his last goal for Manchester United, at the end of January against Leicester City .

Virgin Australia are being questioned on social media for their decision to turn their plane around to take a woman and her baby back to the terminal, where she was questioned by police . Virginie Rutgers started to feed her 10-month-old son to soothe him while their plane taxied out from Gold Coast airport . She used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy, but was told to remove it by Virgin Australia staff. ‘He (the flight attendant) started to raise his voice and become quite abusive,’ Ms Rutgers told Seven News. A woman who alleges she witnessed the incident from a couple of seats away has come forward, describing the ‘shocking’ incident on the Virgin Australia Facebook page. Laureen Fairweather insists the mother and child were sitting in separate seats, with the infant using the appropriate regulation seatbelt while he was being fed. ‘The child was not restrained with the carrier at all! They both had their seat belts on. She was covering herself with the carrier while nursing.’ Ms Fairweather wrote. Virginie used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy whilst they were reportedly both buckled in different seats, but she was told to remove the blanket by Virgin Australia staff . The pilot turned the plane back to the terminal where Ms Rutgers was met by local and federal police, who had reportedly been summoned by Virgin Australia staff . ‘She showed (the staff) too but they insisted it had to go.’ Ms Fairweather was shaken by the staff’s conduct during the confrontation. ‘Having witnessed the whole event, I can honestly guarantee you that it was not a pretty scene.’ ‘(Ms Rutgers) did comply with the rule by restraining herself and the child.’ ‘Absolutely gobsmacked at how rude and offensive the staffs were - totally unprofessional (Sic),’ she wrote. The mother claims staff did not explain why covering her child’s head with a sling was a hazard.

"A teenager caught with a car boot of 20 cannabis joints should not be banned from becoming a teacher or a nurse, Nick Clegg suggested today. The Lib Dem leader was challenged over his call for drug users not to be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances. He said it was ‘ridiculous’ that young people’s future careers could be ‘blighted’ by nothing more than a ‘teenage indiscretion’. Nick Clegg was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record . The Liberal Democrat manifesto will commit the party to ending imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use and ensure that those arrested with small amounts of illicit substances do not get a criminal record. But during his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record. LBC host Nick Ferrari said: ‘I’m an 18-year-old student, I get stopped by police, I have 20 joints in the boot of my car. I subsequently want to become a teacher. Can I become a teacher?’ Mr Clegg insisted that as the law stands that person would not be able to become a teacher. But he said the law needed to be changed: ‘I think it’s completely wrong if some teenager, 17 or 18 year old, dabbles in… I don’t know whether it’s 20 [joints] or one. ‘Do I think their chances of working as a nurse, as a teacher, or a lawyer or a taxi driver should be blighted forever, of course I don’t. ‘If you are a teenager, one in five youngster use drugs, a third of adults have used drugs at some point in their life in this country. ‘What you are saying to me is someone who as a 17 or 18--year-old and has smoked some hassish, and they are caught doing that, you’re saying they should never ever… work as a nurse, as a teacher.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clergg shared a platform with Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson to argue said drug users should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances . Yesterday's announcement follows a controversial ‘research’ project ordered by Lib Dem Home Office ministers, which used taxpayers’ money to study drugs policy around the world. Jeremy Browne and Norman Baker jetted off to examine how other countries tackle drugs. They travelled to ten countries, including the US, Portugal and Sweden, at a cost of almost £40,000. The Lib Dems seized on parts of the report suggesting decriminalisation in countries like Portugal cut the health damage caused by drugs. But critics said they ignored evidence that the number of children using drugs had risen. Pressed again on the scenario of 20 joints, Mr Clegg hit back: ‘If he has got 20 joints is he allowed to be a teacher. ‘Your fixation is whether it was 20. My fixation is whether do I think they should be ruled out forever to work as a teacher. ‘I think it’s ridiculous that we turn what might

"A southern New Jersey woman jailed in an international custody dispute has been freed after spending more than eight years behind bars and is likely to be reunited with her daughter who's been without either parent for nearly a decade. María Jose Carrascosa, a 49-year-old native of Spain, was released from jail Friday night, The Record reported. Carrascosa, formerly of Fort Lee, was paroled last year after moving her daughter, then 5, to Spain when the girl's father, Peter Innes, was granted custody of the child. Freed: María Jose Carrascosa was released from a New Jersey jail on Friday after spending nearly 9 years behind bars for refusing to return her daughter to the United States . Defiant: Carrascosa defiantly refused to bring her daughter back to the United States and thus remained jailed nearly nine years . Once paroled, Carrascosa was taken to the Bergen County Jail for contempt of court for violating a court order to bring the child back. Her release came in part thanks to a letter written to the court by Peter Innes. Superior Court Judge Bonnie Mizdol, ultimately deciding that incarceration would not coerce Carrascosa to comply with child custody orders, ordered her release from jail Friday. Jail time for contempt of court is meant to coerce a person into cooperating with a judges orders, not as a punishment. However, Carrascosa defiantly refused to bring her daughter back to the United States and thus remained jailed. 'The question before this court is whether incarceration has lost its coercive power and has become punitive,' Judge Mizdol said. 'It has become clear that continued incarceration would not compel her to return her daughter, so it would be deemed punitive.' During the hearing, the judge read a letter from Innes, of Hasbrouck Heights, that said he would not oppose Carrascosa's release if she returns to Spain to be with their daughter, Victoria. The judge also read a letter from Victoria, who is now 14, that said: 'My only wish is to be with my mother.' Tearful reunion: Carrascosa had a tearful reunion with her daughter via Skype following her release and says she plans to return to Spain as soon as possible . Finally: Carrascosa's release came after her daughter and estranged husband wrote letters to the court urging a judge to set her free . Dear Victoria, . This is what you've been asking for and I am happy for you this day has finally come. You should know that I did all I could, including petitioning the judge, to help get your mom released. I did this so she can return to you in Spain. Please know, you mom is completely free to immediately leave the United States and return to Spain. I truly hope she is with you tomorrow. For me, this conflict is over. I wish you and your family well and I hope you enjoy your reunion with your mother. I will always be here for you when the time comes that you want to hear the truth as I know it. Love, .

"(CNN)The terrorists who attacked the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia, last week were wearing suicide vests but failed to detonate them before being gunned down by police, Tunisia's President told CNN. ""They had them, but they didn't work, because the police turned up and they were shot down and they didn't have the time to get these vests to work. Because had they done so, we would have had major catastrophe,"" President Beji Caid Essebsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. A third museum attacker remains at large, Essebsi said. Previously two suspects had been identified -- Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou -- though it wasn't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces. Essebsi told Amanpour 15 arrests had been made since Wednesday's attack, in which 23 people were killed. Most of the victims were foreigners and 19 were tourists who'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis. Essebsi said he believed the attackers were members of ISIS who had been trained in Libya. This echoed comments made by Tunisia's Security Minister Rafik Chelly on Friday, who said two attackers had been given weapons training at Libyan camps and had been activated from sleeper cells. In an audio message posted online Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The message said the group had targeted ""crusaders and apostates"" with ""automatic weapons and hand grenades"" in bloodshed that was ""just the start."" CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. An uncle of suspect Yassine Labidi, Abeld Malik Labidi, told CNN on Friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew. He said Yassine Labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum. ""It's true that Yassine carried out this terrorist attack, he was killed; his head, his body, we don't have it back,"" he said. But, he said, he believed Yassine and other young Tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money, organized the logistics and took them to places like Syria and Libya to train as fighters. Laura Smith-Spark and Claudia Morales contributed to this report.

This strike, while leaving Sherwood perplexed, helped suggest there is life after Wilfried Bony for Swansea. The limelight has switched to Gomis since Bony left for Manchester City with £28million going the other way. At times he has struggled to escape the shadow cast by his predecessor. Grave concerns were raised when he lay motionless against Tottenham three weeks ago, before it emerged he has a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and fainting episodes. On Saturday, he missed three good chances. But he kept going and rounded off a lovely goal with a predatory finish. Wayne Routledge danced into space in the middle of the pitch and released Jefferson Montero with a cultured pass.

"Great Britain may be perennial underachievers in world tennis but when it comes to the sport's premier team competition Wimbledon's host nation continues to punch over its weight. In the city of his birth an emotional Andy Murray carried his side into the last eight of the World Group knockout by fending off a ferocious challenge from American giant John Isner to secure a 3-2 victory. To the deafening acclaim of Glasgow's Emirates Arena the former SW19 champion survived a tough opening set to win 7-6 6-3 7-6 against the world number 20 to wrap up the tie with his second point. Andy Murray celebrates extravagantly after winning the first set on a tie break to leave Great Britain just two sets from the quarter-finals .

Murray is forced to stretch to reach a backhand as John Isner put in a much better performance on Sunday in the Davis Cup . Against one of the best servers ever seen in tennis Murray's coolness in the tiebreaks was the key, as was his ability to save seven break points in the opening set. 'It was a great win for the team, everyone played their part,' said Murray. 'Togetherness was a key, everyone was pulling in the same direction. 'I managed to find a way through the first set. I was over complicating my service games at first and he was going for broke on the first point of every rally. The huge American showed aggression in a first set where he forced seven break points on the Murray serve, but couldn't take any of them . Murray was well supported by a partisan Glasgow crowd as he sought to book Great Britain's place in the Davis Cup quarter finals . Isner plays a forehand on the run as the USA's top player started fast in a game his country needed to win to stay alive in the match . Murray was not at his best early on, but rallied to take the first set on a tie break after saving three set points . GB are through to the elite World Group quarter finals for the second year in succession and now face a home tie against France – 3-0 winners over Germany - immediately after Wimbledon in July. If on grass it is likely to be held somewhere like Eastbourne or Nottingham, but if they opted for an indoor court it would likely come back to Scotland, as the fans here have been outstanding in this match.

The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' In a statement through Bonhams, Turing scholar Andrew Hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how Turing 'remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' He added: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value.' Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952. He agreed to undergo hormone treatment

"Being underweight in mid-life could increase your risk of dementia, claim researchers. A new study shows you are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as Alzheimer's than those of a healthy weight. Obese people appear to be protected against dementia, with a risk around 30 per cent lower than those of healthy weight. The findings contradict many previous studies which have suggested that being fat – with a high Body Mass Index (BMI) - could raise the risk. A new study shows underweight people are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as Alzheimer's than those of a healthy weight (file photo) Study author, Professor Stuart Pocock, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said doctors and policymakers may have to re-think how to best identify those at high risk of dementia. He said 'We also need to pay attention to the causes and public health consequences of the link between underweight and increased dementia risk which our research has established.' 'However, our results also open up an intriguing new avenue in the search for protective factors for dementia - if we can understand why people with a high BMI have a reduced risk of dementia, it's possible that further down the line, researchers might be able to use these insights to develop new treatments for dementia.' Other experts said more research was needed, and the way GPs used to diagnose dementia may have skewed the results. Researchers based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Oxon Epidemiology, also in London, analysed patient information recorded during routine general practice over nearly two decades. Data on 1,958,191 patients aged 55 on average with a BMI of 26.5 on average - just within the range usually classed as overweight - were examined. BMI is assessed by comparing height to weight, in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared. A healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 – above is overweight and obese. The study regarded BMI of less than 20 as underweight. After nine years follow-up, 45,507 people were diagnosed with dementia. Researchers found people who were underweight in middle age were 34 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those of a healthy weight. The findings contradict many previous studies which have suggested that being fat – with a high Body Mass Index (BMI) - could raise the risk (file photo) As people's BMI increased, the risk of dementia fell, with very obese people having a BMI greater than 40 less likely to develop the condition than those of normal weight. The link was not affected by the decade in which patients were born, age at diagnosis, alcohol use or smoking. The new research was published in The Lancet Diabetes And Endocrinology journal (must credit). Dr Nawab Qizilbash, from Oxon Epidemiology in London, said the reasons why high BMI might lead to a lower risk of dementia are not clear. 'Many different issues related to diet, exercise, frailty, genetic factors and weight change

"Oh be still my beating heart. Here we are, standing on the gravel outside the library doors at Highclere Castle, the English stately home in Hampshire that provides the ravishing setting for the television series, Downton Abbey. We are on the very spot where Matthew Crawley asked Lady Mary to marry him in the first Downton Abbey Christmas special, broadcast in 2011. Remember when the violins soared and snowflakes fell? When Matthew got down on one miraculously recovered knee to propose? For many viewers, this was their all-time favourite Downton scene. Scroll down for video . To the manor married: Lady Carnarvon, the real-life equivalent of Downton Abbey’s Cora, in front of Highclere . ‘Well, that wasn’t my favourite scene!’ cries the Countess of Carnarvon, the current chatelaine of Highclere and the real-life equivalent of Downton’s Cora, who’s Countess of Grantham. ‘The crew were using ash to recreate the snow. It got inside the house and we had to spend ages dusting and cleaning the rooms. And the smell! Very acrid. We reached the point where we had to stop them doing it.’ Lady Carnarvon has always been quite frank about the travails of letting a film crew loose inside her beautiful home. On the plus side, there are the location fees and increased visitor traffic; the crowds paying £20 a head to goggle at the splendour of her Highclere interiors and the red velvet sofas where the Crawleys gather to take tea. ‘Yes. It’s like that show, Poke Your Nose Through The Keyhole,’ she says. On the downside, damage and disruption. ‘I do get annoyed when visitors chuck litter about, but my husband goes around picking it up. We fill black bags with the stuff.’ And since the very first day of Downton filming, when a technician smashed a much-loved green objet de vertu trinket box, she has been on red alert for transgressions. When she is not telling the crew that she pops open the champagne the minute they leave, she is issuing instructions on the correct way to move precious antique furniture. ‘You lift a girl in your arms and a chair by its bottom,’ she will say. As Carson the butler (‘Oh, I adore him, he is divine’) would no doubt agree, the problem with having high standards is that so few manage to live up to them. Another who has incurred her displeasure is Ralph Lauren. The wealthy American designer and his family recently attended a swanky dinner at Highclere, hosted by the Earl and Countess. The Laurens committed the social faux pas of taking numerous photographs of themselves grinning cheesily on the famous Oak Staircase, and elsewhere in sumptuous Highclere, then proudly posting the snaps online. Her ladyship was not best pleased. ‘My interpretation of dinner is having a meal and his interpretation is taking photographs. It seemed to get out of hand. I have to live with that.’ Has she seen the pictures? ‘No and I don’t want to, because I don’t want to be irritated by them. My idea of a nice evening is

'Whether we need to improve on the tactical I'm not sure but we've got some of the best managers in the world in this league.

"Fernando Alonso is convinced success is on the horizon for McLaren on the day when he saw former team Ferrari return to glory. After missing the season-opening Australian Grand Prix as he recovered from a concussion sustained in a test crash, Alonso's first outing on his return to the team ended in retirement after 21 laps of the Malaysian Grand Prix due to an ERS cooling issue. As Alonso spoke and delivered his verdict on the weekend when McLaren have at least made some progress, Sebastian Vettel was charging around in the background en route to his first win for 16 months. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso is all smiles in Malaysia despite not finishing the Grand Prix on Sunday . Alonso's McLaren is wheeled into the garage after he was forced to retire from the Malaysian Grand Prix . The German is, of course, Alonso's replacement at Ferrari as the 33-year-old opted to quit the Maranallo marque after five years without success of trying to claim a third title. What must Alonso have thought later when he saw Vettel stand on the top step of the podium, the first time a Ferrari driver had done so since the Spaniard himself in his home grand prix two years ago. Whatever Alonso's thoughts, all he can do now is remain convinced McLaren's early woes in conjunction with new power-unit supplier Honda will ultimately lead to the results he craves. It is a case of short-term pain for long-term gain as Alonso said: 'These reliability problems are normal. The Spaniard failed to finish the race on Sunday, managing just 21 laps at the Malaysian Grand Prix . 'What you normally find in winter testing, we have to find in the first couple of races unfortunately. We need to accept maybe some retirements and we are ready to do so. 'Definitely it has been a very nice weekend and a very nice surprise to see the improvements from Australia to here. 'If we keep up this rate then we will enjoy success very soon.' Overall, Alonso expressed 'mixed feelings' as to how the weekend had unfolded, adding: 'I'm happy to be back and very happy with the progress the team has made. Both McLaren's failed to finish the race in Malaysia as they continue to struggle for form this F1 season . 'Watching the race on the TV in Australia, we were very far off - four seconds in the race and just one McLaren running alone at the back. 'Here we were much more competitive in qualifying, running with everyone in the race, which was a very nice surprise. 'But not finishing the race is never a nice feeling, so let's see if we can improve next time.'

"(CNN)On the eve of the one-year mark since nearly 300 schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria, Malala Yousafzai released an ""open letter"" to the girls Monday. ""Like you, I was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school,"" she writes in the letter. The 17-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner survived an attack by the Taliban, which had singled her out for blogging from Pakistan about the importance of staying in school. In the letter, she calls on the Nigerian government and the international community to do more to rescue the girls. Nigeria recently held an election. On April 14, 2014, Islamists with Boko Haram kidnapped the girls, prompting an international campaign for their safe return, which used the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. On Monday, UNICEF announced a new campaign for the 800,000 children who have been displaced in northeast Nigeria, using the hashtag #BringBackOurChildhood. Malala is admired globally as a figure standing for peace. On Sunday, a NASA astrophysicist named an asteroid after her. She has spoken with CNN about the Nigerian abductions previously. Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . Here is the full letter: . To my brave sisters, the kidnapped schoolgirls of Chibok, . On this first anniversary of your captivity, I write to you with a message of solidarity, love and hope. My name is Malala. I am a Pakistani girl your age. I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers. We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you. We will always stand with you. Today and every day, we call on the Nigerian authorities and the international community to do more to bring you home. We will not rest until you have been reunited with your families. Like you, I was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school. Gunmen shot me and two of my friends on a school bus. All three of us survived and are back in school. Now we speak out on behalf of all girls about the right to get a proper education. Our campaign will continue until you and all girls and boys around the world are able to access a free, safe and quality secondary education. Last July, I spent my 17th birthday in Nigeria with some of your parents and five of your classmates who escaped the kidnapping. Your parents are grief-stricken. They love you, and they miss you. My father and I wept and prayed with your parents -- and they touched our hearts. The escapee schoolgirls my father and I met impressed us with their resolve to overcome their challenges and to complete their high school education. My father and I promised your parents and the girls who had escaped that we would do all we could to help them. I met Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and urged him to work harder for your freedom. I also

"In telly terms, the FA Cup has had quite - what they like to call in the trade - a 'journey’ this season. This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene. This no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC’s on-site studio. ‘I don’t like semi finals at Wembley’, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it. Well, some twenty four hour or so later, Wembley was certainly delighted to host them. Arsenal players celebrate during the victory over Reading which saw the Gunners reach the FA Cup final . Fabian Delph (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Liverpool at Wembley . Wembley Stadium was a great setting for this weekend's two FA Cup semi-final clashes . Prior to that first clash on Saturday between Arsenal and Reading, there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the Emirates Stadium. This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as ‘difficult to watch’. If you weren’t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion. Alongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn’t treat their premature trip to north west London as ‘a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal. Well, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement. Reading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday . What’s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories. ‘It’s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn’t it Wrighty?’, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. ‘Don’t start again, Gary!’, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros. And then there was Reading’s Adam Federici. I was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups, and while doing

"When Jose Mourinho returned to English football in 2013, he produced a pair of spectacles from his pocket to claim it was the only thing that had changed in six years away from Chelsea. This time Mourinho has read the small print, carrying out Roman Abramovich’s vision for his club to be self-financing and operating within UEFA’s strict Financial Fair Play guidelines. They were rather more gung-ho in 2004, spraying money around Europe to sign some of the best talent in the game to make sure Chelsea cleaned up in Mourinho’s first three seasons at Stamford Bridge. From July 1, 2004 to July 20, 2004, Abramovich splashed £89million on seven players — including Petr Cech, Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba — in a whirlwind shopping spree. They finished the season with the title. Jose Mourinho won his first trophy since returning to England when Chelsea beat Tottenham on Sunday . The Portuguese manager has reduced spending at the club but has continued to bring success . Players like Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have been brought to the club and proved a huge success . On Sunday evening, less than half an hour after John Terry had lifted the Capital One Cup, Chelsea’s manager claimed the club are now operating in the ‘third tier’ of clubs. Financial Fair Play has become something of a hobby horse of Mourinho in recent months. He highlights the money-no-object strategies of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain while emphasising how Chelsea are working within strict, fiscal parameters. ‘There are teams who don’t care about FFP and are punished, but they play,’ he added. ‘Then there is a group, which Chelsea are in, the group who care about FFP.’ Last week, City manager Manuel Pellegrini did not have the confidence to start Eliaquim Mangala, who cost £32m last summer, alongside captain Vincent Kompany against Barcelona. After Chelsea collected the Capital One Cup, a trophy City won last season, Mourinho referred to £11m signing Kurt Zouma, 20, as his ‘Marcel Desailly’ after a mature performance alongside Ramires in midfield. Whichever way you look at it, the numbers add up for Mourinho as he turns his attention to winning his third Premier League title. Chelsea sold defender David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain for a staggering £50million last summer . Juan Mata was a star player for Chelsea but when Mourinho arrived he sold him to Manchester United . Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku was sold to Everton for £28m, giving Chelsea a considerable profit . The average age of his Chelsea team at Wembley on Sunday was 27 years and three months compared to the 28 of City, beaten 2-1 by Liverpool at Anfield earlier in the day. And Mourinho’s squad looks the better long-term bet. Once a player has worn that blue shirt, there is an automatic premium, as Mourinho has used to great effect, whenever he decides to move them on. They made a profit of about £18m on Romelu Lukaku, who made just 10 Premier League appearances for Chelsea, when he was sold to Everton before the start

"Christian Eriksen is set to become the youngest Dane to win 50 caps after he was named in the squad by manager Morten Olsen on Tuesday ahead of friendlies against the United States and France. The 23-year-old Tottenham midfielder should reach the 50 international milestone at a younger age than previous record holder Michael Laudrup. The Spurs playmaker made his debut in March 2010, becoming the youngest Dane to play for the national side since Michael Laudrup and the fourth youngest ever. Christian Eriksen is set to become the youngest player to earn 50 international caps for Denmark . Eriksen has currently played for the national side 49 times since making his debut in March 2010 . During his 49 caps so far Eriksen has only scored one competitive goal with his other four strikes coming in friendlies, and the former Ajax man has often been criticised for his performance for Denmark. Captain Daniel Agger, defender Lars Jacobsen and midfielder William Kvist were named in the squad despite having been involved in a bitter dispute with the Danish FA (DBU) over a collective bargaining agreement. Negotiations to resolve the dispute, which concerns payments and bonuses to men's, women's and Under-21 international teams, are ongoing, the DBU said.

"He joined The Daily Show as a correspondent only three months ago. But now, Trevor Noah has reportedly emerged as the frontrunner to replace host Jon Stewart. The 31-year-old South African comedian has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the Comedy Central show this year. He is being considered for an integral position on the program, a source close to the matter told Variety magazine. However, no final decision has yet been reached by network executives. Scroll down for video . Replacement? Trevor Noah (left) joined The Daily Show as a correspondent three months ago. But now, he has reportedly emerged as the frontrunner to replace the Comedy Central program's host Jon Stewart (right) 'Shortlisted': The 31-year-old South African comedian (pictured in 2012) has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the show this year . According to the source, Comedy Central's efforts to select a replacement for Stewart - who has hosted the satirical news show for a staggering 16 years - have gained speed in recent days. Last month, shortly after Stewart revealed his plans to step down from his role, company executive Doug Herzog confirmed that a 'short list' of possible replacements had already been put together. He added that the channel and Stewart were consulting on when he will depart his job, as well as discussing whether he will have continue to have a role with the show he has hosted since 1999. When asked about a possible future role, Herzog, 55, the president of Viacom Entertainment Group, replied 'TBD', meaning 'to be determined'. He then added: 'It's not out of the question.' If Noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on-air - replaces Stewart on The Daily Show this year, he will be joining a primarily white, male and straight late night show landscape. At present, Comedy Central is the only network to have an African-American host: Larry Wilmore, A network spokesman declined to tell Variety whether Noah was being considered for Stewart's job. No stranger to controversy: During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, Noah (pictured during the broadcast) used his mixed-race heritage and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests in the US over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart that his arms were 'tired' from constantly 'holding them up' Thorny issues: 'I never thought I'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa,' he said, adding: 'It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days back home.' He also riffed on Ebola with Stewart . Noah, who grew up in Gauteng, started his entertainment career at 18 on the South African soap opera, Isidingo. He shortly began hosting his own radio show on the region's main youth station. Now, he is a well-known TV personality in the country, with his stand-up shows often selling out.

"A father of a 12-year-old girl who he married off in an Islamic ceremony told his daughter told his daughter not to take the contractive pill because it 'causes breast cancer'. The father, who cannot be named legally, is on trial at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court charged with procuring a child for unlawful sexual activity and with being an accessory before the fact of sexual intercourse with a child. He took the stand at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court today and recounted the day of the Islamic wedding ceremony at his Hunter Valley home between his child and a 26-year-old Lebanese national on January 12 last year, according to the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . A 27-year-old man (pictured) has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years behind bars for marrying and sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl. Now her father is on trial for agreeing to the arrangement because he discovered that his daughter was' menstruating and interested in boys' a court heard . The man admitted to the court he told his daughter not to take the pill so 'she didn't get breast cancer', and said he had heard about its dangers through the McGrath Foundation. “I say it all the time,” he said. Earlier this week the court heard the father told his daughter Australian laws forbidding her from marrying were 'stupid'. The girl told a Sydney court her father said Australian law was 'stupid' and girls her age should be allowed to get married and have sexual intercourse. The girl's interview with a child protection worker was played as part of her father's trial. She said days after her wedding, her father began to panic that her husband might be jailed. 'He was upset because we might be in trouble,' the girl said. '(My father) knows no marriage under the age of 16. 'Because he says to me the law here is stupid, girls your age should be allowed to get married and have intercourse. 'He said we didn't do anything wrong, we were just following religion.' Her father said her husband, now 27, 'shouldn't be put away', and that they were 'just following religion'. The girl, now 14, said in her father's religion, marriage was allowed once the girl got her period and having sex before marriage was punishable by stoning or death in Islamic countries. '(Premarital sex) is actually one of the worst things you can do,' she said. The court also heard the girl and her husband had sex 'once or twice' a day after they were married. They also spent five nights staying at her father's house. The girl also detailed the motivation for the marriage being organised, which was her reaching puberty. In the video interview shown to the court, she said she understood puberty to be 'blood...when I got my period'. She also said her father told her not to take birth control pills, and that her father reminded her not to let her husband wear a condom. 'Don't use pills or condoms - don't

"(CNN)James Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering ""a psychotic episode"" at the time, according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence ""revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012,"" the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as ""four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine."" The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges.

"For Dave King, the battle for control of Rangers is all but over. The resignation of Ibrox chairman David Somers on Monday morning brought confirmation that the end of days has arrived for this reviled current plc board. Yet, the hard work starts here as King and his backers try to revive an institution that has been more akin to a circus than a football club in the chaotic last three years since administration, then liquidation, visited Govan. Here, Sportsmail looks at the tasks that will be taking priority in King’s packed in-tray as he embarks on a rebuilding job that he and his team believe could take up to five years. Dave King is set to take control of Rangers after chairman Dave Somers resigned from post on Monday . 1. Appoint a new executive team . With the repayment of Mike Ashley’s £5million loan, and running costs of upwards of £25m over the next two years, Rangers need a top-class executive team in place as quickly as possible to map out the club’s financial future. After Friday’s extraordinary general meeting, King will install his allies Paul Murray and John Gilligan as directors. The two remaining current plc directors, Derek Llambias, Rangers’ chief executive, and Barry Leach, director of finance, are not expected to tender their resignations. But King’s first move is expected to be to sack and replace them — whatever the cost. Not surprisingly to those following this rapacious Rangers saga, Llambias and Leach have both just been awarded bumper contracts, complete with lengthy notice periods. 2. Appoint a manager . Kenny McDowall tendered his resignation in January and the uncomfortable-looking 51-year-old keeps making it plain he does not want to be the manager of Rangers a minute longer than he absolutely has to. Under his management, performances have been poor with Rangers winning just two of their last six games. But it would take a collapse of monumental proportions for the Ibrox side to be overtaken by Falkirk and Queen of the South for a place in the play-offs. Stuart McCall is being viewed as the favourite for the post, while fans would love to see King bring back Walter Smith, even in a short-term capacity. But whoever the new manager is, the speedier the appointment, the more time he would have to set his players up for a push at promotion. What is unarguable is this: the new man needs to coax better performances than managed by Ally McCoist and McDowall if Rangers are to overcome a Hibs side that has swatted them aside with ease in the Championship this season. Interim Rangers manager Kenny McDowall does not want the job a minute longer than he has to . 3. Player recruitment . There are 12 Rangers first-team players out of contract in the summer. Captain Lee McCulloch, plus Kris Boyd, Kenny Miller, Jon Daly, Bilel Mohsni, Darren McGregor, Richard Foster, Steven Smith, Sebastien Faure, Ian Black, Kyle Hutton and Steve Simonsen all see their deals run out on June 1, 2015.

Fun guys: A new species of mushroom that looks like a man has been discovered by the side of a busy road . They have been named as geastrum britannicum to reflect them being unique to the UK. Mr Revett, 49, said: 'They do look like little mushroom men. 'It's really strange how their shape makes them look like they have a head and arms. That's what drew my attention to them.' Despite first spotting them in 2000, the fungus was dismissed as a species of earthstar fungi which is prevalent in Norfolk. Having been interested in mycology - the study of fungus - for more than 40 years, Mr Revett sent them off to Kew Gardens for testing. The fungus, found in Cockley Cley, Norfolk, has fleshy off-shoots that appear to resemble human heads, arms and legs . However, 15 years later, mycologists in Spain carried out DNA sequence analysis and have just confirmed they differ slightly. Mr Revett - who runs the mycology website fenfungi.com - said: 'It felt brilliant knowing I'd found something new. 'I wouldn't normally question the experts but I just knew these were different. 'I go back to the site every year doing tours and they're always there.

"Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine. Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. ""My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,"" Klitschko told CNN. ""I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting."" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. ""People are dying in Ukraine every single day,"" Klitschko said. ""I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen."" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. ""I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,"" he said. ""Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want. ""If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and

"Ronny Deila is preparing for the William Hill Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness, believing Celtic themselves provide the biggest hurdle to their treble hopes. The Scottish League Cup winners are eight points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Scottish Premiership with six games remaining and strong favourites to make it four in a row. Asked ahead of the trip to Hampden Park on Sunday if he felt he had a treble-winning squad at his disposal, the Norwegian boss said: . Ronny Deila is preparing his Celtic side for Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness . As they ready themselves for the trip to Hampden Park, Celtic will be focused on treble hopes . 'We will see but I really believe that we can do it and now it is up to us. 'If we are performing well, we know that we are very hard to beat. 'We have shown that for a long, long time now and again, our biggest opponent is ourselves. 'We need to keep our mind on the right things. 'I have felt a sense of excitement for a long time. But it is very important to focus on the next training session and next game, instead of thinking of what might be, thinking of what we have to do to make it as good as possible now.' Deila believes treble success will help not only attract players to the club this summer, but also help keep those who are already at Parkhead and perhaps thinking of moving to pastures new.

Kemp said she received a letter from the local school board stating the oils had created a 'problem' for staff and students. 'I could put chemicals in his body, but I can't put anything natural on him that has some kind of smell?' she added.

"A new video shows LA police officers dragging a homeless man from his tent just moments before they shot him dead in a street confrontation on the city's Skid Row. This latest video shows the man - who is thought to have been called Booth, but is known locally as 'Africa' and 'Cameroon' in reference to his African heritage - disappearing into his tent after apparently speaking to police. But officers swoop down on the man and drag him from his tent, which appears to collapse. A violent altercation ensues before five officers manage to pin him down - and then three officers open fire, killing the man. The CCTV, shot from the local homeless shelter, has shed yet more light on the violent midday confrontation which has left many shocked after an initial video appeared on social media on Sunday. Conversation: The homeless shelter's CCTV footage shows the man apparently talk to officers . Hiding?: The man then gets into his tent - but the officers appear to be trying to get him out . Increase: More officers arrive and begin to try to drag the man - who was known as 'Africa' - from the tent . Shot dead: A violent altercation ensued and the homeless man, circled in red, was gunned down by officers . The first footage released of the incident showed the man flailing at officers before being pinned to the floor. They try to use a Taser on him - but it seemingly has no effect. Shouts of 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' can be heard seconds before three officers open fire on the prone man. Outraged crowds soon gathered at the scene, accusing the police of unjustly killing him. Witnesses have characterised the police response as overly aggressive, and say they should have been able to restrain a mentally-ill homeless man with non-lethal means. Pressure for the LAPD to produce evidence to vindicate their officers has been mounting ever since the video was released. A police statement on the killing said that 'the suspect and officers struggled over one of the officer's handguns' before shots were fired - a statement the LAPD say is backed up by onlooker footage. But officials claim a frame from an onlooker's video shows the man grabbing at an officer's waistband, while a close-up of the weapon in question apparently shows damage caused by the scuffle. LAPD officials say the man was wanted in connection with a robbery, and started brawling with officers who approached him. Collapse: The video appears to show the tent collapse as the man emerges from his hiding place . Fight: The CCTV then captures the altercation which ended in the man's death at the hands of officers . Police chief Charlie Beck has called Sunday's killing an 'extreme tragedy' - and implored anybody with video evidence to submit it to police. He has also revealed two of the officers were wearing body-mounted cameras. His statement came as more information emerged about the drifter, whom friends say came from Cameroon and lived in the U.S.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely formal, yet troubling scene. A room in a far flung corner of Afghanistan where a serious lecture is happening, to an audience that seems part ideological, part curious; some are just impoverished, hoping for a quick job. At the front of this room stands an Afghan freshly back from fighting in Syria, and intent on recruiting other Afghans to fight alongside him for ISIS. ""Brothers, I am here to tell you"", the recruiter begins, ""about the mujahideen in Syria."" All faces are hidden in the footage, yet the motivations are clear. This seems to be part of ISIS's first moves into Afghanistan, a bid to bolster their ranks for the fight in Iraq and Syria by vacuuming up disgruntled former Taliban fighters -- or even just students looking for a cause. But it's a troubling move nonetheless. There's no shortage of battle-hardened militants here. And as NATO leaves, the Taliban looks strong if a little fractured -- and the possibility of peace talks ahead with the Afghan government could alienate some of the group's more radical elements. The man is one of five recruiters, he says -- some foreign, others Afghan like him, spread out across the country. His message is broadly ideological. ""Jihad is now obligatory not only in Afghanistan, but also in many other places in the world,"" the recruiter tells the room. ""The Christians and Jews have not only attacked Afghanistan, but they have also attacked Muslims in Syria, Iraq and Palestine. So Jihad is obligatory on us in these places."" His reception is mixed, but to one audience member the ideological appeal is clear. ""My aim is to fight infidels,"" the man says. ""In Syria, or if they ask me to in Afghanistan, I will."" Another man says he would prefer to stay home and go to university, but he is attracted by the recruiter's offer of money. ""I definitely need the money,"" he says, ""but will stay here and hope peace comes."" Concerns are growing about how ISIS may expand into Afghanistan. When asked why ISIS might be on the rise here, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: ""The reason it's happening is because (the) collapse of Yemen, Syria, Iraq has created an environment where instead of one weak link in the interrelated system of states, now there are wider spaces."" Ghani added: ""They have -- it's one of the most well-endowed finance -- well-financed organizations. And the techniques are spreading."" The United Nations Special Representative to Afghanistan, Nicholas Haysom, told the Security Council that ISIS's presence in Afghanistan was ""of concern,"" but was most troubling in its ""potential to offer an alternative flagpole to which otherwise isolated insurgent splinter groups can rally."" A senior U.S. official told CNN that ""the terrain is there"" for ISIS to grow in Afghanistan. This is ""something everyone is keeping a very close eye on. Afghanistan government is concerned. Pakistan government is concerned,"" he said, before adding that disaffected Taliban might also be attracted to the group. The path to CNN's filming with

DailyMail.com last weekend exposed Brady Eaves, the privately-educated stepson of a former Mississippi governor candidate, as the teenager who shrieked with laughter as he murdered the small animal in a video from a drunken Spring Break party. The footage, allegedly filmed in Florida, could see Eaves charged with felony animal cruelty charges, which carry a maximum jail term of five years and $5,000 in fines. In a statement branding his actions 'disturbing' and 'disappointing', Eaves' stepfather and mother revealed he has been withdrawn from the University of Mississippi, where he was on a scholarship, and submitted for mental health tests. It comes after Phi Delta Theta openly condemned Eaves' actions and expelled him from the fraternity.

His stepfather John Arthur Eaves Jr, who was the Democratic candidate in Mississippi's 2007 gubernatorial elections, and mother Angel Eaves told the press: 'Let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet. 'The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character.' They added: 'As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again.' Sources close to Eaves told DailyMail.com he was top of his class at private Jackson Preparatory School, and described him as an 'animal lover' whose numerous pets include a raccoon and a parrot.

"Hillary Clinton imposed a blanket of secrecy on her movements at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and told aides they would be fired if she was seen, it is claimed. Mrs Clinton said that she wanted nobody to know when she was going to the pool apart from one usher who was to guide her there. There she would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking ‘heartbroken’, according to a new book. A new book has claimed that Hillary Clinton imposed a blanket of secrecy on her movements during the Monica Lewinsky scandal . The vivid account is written by Kate Andersen Brower, a former White House correspondent for Bloomberg News in ‘The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.’ She tells how in the summer of 1998, a few days before Mr Clinton would admit to sex with former White House intern Miss Lewinsky, usher Worthington White was approached by Mrs Clinton. She told him that she wanted to go to the pool but that only he could see her - no other aides and no Secret Service. Mr White said that he told Mrs Clinton’s lead Secret Service agent: ‘If anybody sees her, or she sees anybody, I’m going to get fired, I know it. And you probably will too’. By the pool Mrs Clinton would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking ‘heartbroken, it is claimed . Mrs Clinton’s wish was granted and she took an elevator to the pool, spent the afternoon there and came back the same way, . Miss Brower writes that Mrs Clinton ‘turned to White, took his hands and squeezed them, looked him in the eye, and thanked him.’ The book also recounts how the Clintons did not trust the old fashioned White House telephone system and felt too many people could listen in - so had it completely rewired . Miss Brower writes: ‘They had all the White House phones changed over to interior circuitry so that if the first lady was in the bedroom and the president was in the study, she could ring him from room to room without going through the operator’. Such upheaval did not go down well with staff and according to James W.F. ‘Skip’ Allen, an usher from 1979 to 2004, the Clintons were ‘about the most paranoid people I’d ever seen in my life’. The disclosure sheds new light on the row over Mrs Clinton’s use of a private email account and her own personal server whilst Secretary of State. It could harm her chances in the race for the Presidency in 2016 - she is expected to announce her candidacy this month. A new poll has found that Mrs Clinton’s approval ratings have slipped since the scandal broke and she is two points behind former Florida governor Jeb Bush, her likely opponent. Bill Clinton admitted in the summer of 1998 that he was having sex with former White House intern Miss Lewinsky (pictured)

"Christopher Dearlove coughed over nurses telling them he had Ebola to try to get a hospital bed . Britain's most prolific 'hospital hopper' has been jailed after shutting down an A&E department by pretending to have Ebola. Homeless Christopher Dearlove, 59, was banned from entering any NHS building unless he had a genuine medical problem in 2010 after making up ailments to get a free bed for the night. But earlier this year he forced Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby into lock-down after telling nurses he had Ebola, coughing over them and demanding treatment. He was jailed at Grimsby Crown Court for 14 months. Dearlove, who is an alcoholic, had been drinking for almost four hours when he walked into the Grimsby A&E in February. The man, who is thought to be homeless, told nurses he had recently returned from West Africa where his wife had died of the disease. He claimed he had tested positive for Ebola at Johannesburg airport before coughing over staff. Using a false name, he was then heard saying: 'It’s not my fault if everyone becomes infected.' Part of the A&E was forced into lock-down as nurses rushed into protective clothing. He was arrested after a member of staff recognised him and phoned the police. It is not thought Dearlove received any testing or treatment at the hospital. Sentencing, Judge David Tremberg said: 'You gave hard pressed medical services more cause for concern and work. 'They should not be diverted from genuinely sick and injured patients and not be indulging in your fantasies. 'Claiming Ebola and coughing on people is a particularly unpleasant and unattractive act.' Part of Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby was forced to close as a result of the stunt in February . In carrying out the stunt Dearlove broke an anti-social behaviour order issued in 2010 which banned him from visiting hospitals unless genuinely ill. It was imposed after he told nurses at various facilities that he was a haemophiliac with AIDS and coughed up fake blood to get a room. On separate occasions he claimed to have been experiencing weight loss, night sweats and pain in his chest in order to be admitted. From 2006 the NHS began distributing images of the fraudster to stop A&E departments across the country from admitting him. The alcoholic would give a false name and medical history and list symptoms he knew were likely to secure him an isolated room. Each of his stints cost between £400 and £1,000 according to the NHS security management service. Every time he was admitted. Defending at Grimsby Crown Court, Ernie Lidster said he had a psychiatric disorder. Dearlove was jailed for 14 months at Grimsby Crown Court (above). In court his lawyer said he had a mental disorder .

"A giant semi-fossilised egg that is almost 100 times larger than a chicken's egg and still has the tiny skeleton of a bird inside is to go on sale for more than £50,000. The rare egg, which is 12 inches long and more than eight inches in diametre, belonged to the now extinct elephant bird that lived on Madagascar. The flightless birds, which stood nearly 10 feet (three metres) tall and weighted half a tonne, died out in the 17th century after heavy hunting. Scroll down for video . This 12 inch long elephant bird egg - just one of 25 known to remain intact around the world - is going on sale . There are thought to be just 25 preserved intact elephant bird eggs left in existence, with most in museums. Now one owned by a German marine biologist Professor Hubert Caspers, who worked at the Institute for Hydrobiology and Fisheries Science before his death in 1998, is to go on sale in Bruges, Belgium. Genetic material has been extracted from the shells of ancient elephant bird eggs. It has raised hopes that it may be possible to use cloning techniques to resurrect the extinct species. By injecting the genetic material into the unfertilised eggs of other large flightless birds like the ostrich, it may be possible to recreate the elephant bird. However, scientists face significant challenges that need to be overcome before this is possible. Cloning birds is considered to be particularly challenging. Extracting enough DNA from eggshells is also thought to be another limiting factor. Finally much of the habitat the the elephant birds once inhabited has now changed, so there may be few places where such a large species could now live. Scans taken of the egg, which is at least 400 years old, have also revealed the tiny bones of an embryo that had started to grow inside along with dehydrated organic material. Scientists were recently able to extract DNA from a similar egg, raising hopes that it may be possible to bring the elephant bird back to life using cloning techniques. Auctioneers Rob Michiels, who is selling the egg along with other items from Dr Caspers collection, said the egg appeared to be older than other eggs that have been sold recently. He said: 'The eggs of elephant birds are extremely rare - there are probably 25 of them in the world. 'This once comes from the collection of Dr Caspers and we have been asked to sell it by his children who thought it was a dinosaur egg. 'The children didn't know a lot about their father's collection. 'I was invited to Hamburg to look at a collection of antique tiles that he owned and I spotted the egg. It was just sat in a box. 'We have had a CT scan of the egg and it showed there is still organic, dehydrated material inside in the form of fetal bones. 'Technically, you could extract DNA from it and if you have a very large ostrich you could re-create a form of an elephant

"Around 200 skeletons have been unearthed under a Paris supermarket after workmen extending the shop's basement discovered a huge pile of bones. The bodies, which were found neatly stacked five deep in eight underground chambers, are thought to be victims of an epidemic that struck France at least five centuries ago. Archaeologists from the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) were called in to take a look and have spent days tirelessly uncovering the bones. Around 200 skeletons have been unearthed under a small Paris supermarket after workmen extending the shop's basement discovered a huge pile of bones . They found seven chambers containing around 20 skeletons each and a further chamber that had another 150. Pascal Roy, store manager of the Monoprix supermarket, said that the shop had been built on the site of the old Trinité hospital, which functioned from as early as the 12th century. He said: 'We figured there'd be a few bones there considering it used to be the site of a cemetery, but we didn't expect to find mass graves.' But other experts have said the bodies might have been placed there when more than six-million corpses were moved to the Paris Catacombs from the city's cemeteries 200 years ago . Archaeologists are slowly and delicately uncovering the skeletons and attaching numbers to them. Above are skeletons 159, 157 and 162 . The bodies are thought to be victims of an epidemic that struck France at least five centuries ago - perhaps the plague or a famine . They were neatly stacked five deep in eight underground chambers. Seven of the chambers contained 20 skeletons and one contained more than 150 . Experts called the site 'extraordinary' and said they were astonished to find so many skeletons in one place. They said: 'The fact that the skeletons were so closely packed together in a mass grave suggests that they were the victims of an epidemic like the plague, which struck France throughout the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. 'The grave provides an excellent opportunity to learn about how death was managed and how funerary practices were carried out centuries ago.'

Around 200 skeletons have been unearthed under a Paris supermarket after workmen extending the shop's basement discovered a huge pile of bones. The bodies, which were found neatly stacked five deep in eight underground chambers, are thought to be victims of an epidemic that struck France at least five centuries ago. Archaeologists are slowly and delicately uncovering the skeletons and attaching numbers to them.","

"Felicity Bassouls, 67, is accused of harassing former England winger Ben Cohen after he split from her daughter Abby in September last year . England rugby and Strictly star Ben Cohen is to give evidence against his mother-in-law, who is accused of bombarding him with emails and calls after he split from his wife amid rumours of an affair. Felicity Bassouls, 67, who lives in the Highlands of Scotland, is accused of harassing the former England winger after he split from her daughter Abby in September last year. The World Cup winner, 36, was facing accusations that his marriage was ended by the 'curse' of the BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing.

Mrs Bassouls arrived at Northampton Magistrates' Court to answer a summons of two counts of harassment without violence. One is against Cohen and one her own son, Austen Blaney, between 1 September and 29 October last year. The former Northampton Saints player is the founder of The Ben Cohen StandUp Foundation, which aims to raise awareness of the long-term, damaging effects of bullying. In a statement issued at the time of the split the couple said: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children. 'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.'

"Sam Allardyce admits he was wrong to claim Winston Reid had been tapped up after the West Ham defender finally penned a fresh contract with the club. Talks between the Hammers and Reid had been ongoing for several months, with reported interest from the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal leaving many West Ham supporters on tenterhooks over the future of their New Zealand international. Allardyce said in January that it was 'highly unlikely' Reid had not already verbally agreed to leave Upton Park given that he was yet to sign a new contract and went on to suggest earlier this month that he needed to rope in the questioning techniques of Jack Bauer from television's '24' to get an answer out of the player. Winston Reid signed a new six-and-a-half year deal West Ham last week after it appeared he would leave . Sam Allardyce had said it was unlikely that Reid had not verbally agreed to join another club . But the 26-year-old, who will miss Saturday's trip to Arsenal through injury, has now signed a six-and-a-half-year contract to keep him tied down to the east London outfit - with Allardyce quick to admit he had misread the situation. 'I was wrong, so I admit that,' he said when asked if he was surprised to see Reid sign a new deal having questioned whether he had been tapped up. 'For me, if somebody's out of contract like that it would have all been done and dusted by the end of the season, even though it might not have been done and dusted from a paperwork point of view. 'His agent would have sorted out a deal somewhere or other in this country. I was probably more concerned about abroad because it could have been a pre-contract. The central defender had been linked with the likes of Tottenham and Arsenal before penning new contract . 'One of the bigger clubs in Europe could have seen what Winston has done here and said ""he's the one for us"" and taken him abroad so I was obviously wrong.' Allardyce believes a strong showing for West Ham this season would have helped convince Reid to stay put - insisting no club bigger than the Hammers had looked like making a move for his signature. 'It was the longest negotiation ever,' he added. 'I think that in the end both parties are very, very pleased with the outcome. I think the big pull for Winston signing this time around is that we've had a good season up until now that we need to finish off as strong as we can. Reid fights for the ball with Tottenham striker Harry Kane during the recent match at White Hart Lane . '(We are) moving to the Olympic Stadium in 2016, so where else is he going to get bigger than West Ham United?

"A young English fan who wrote a letter to Richie Benaud asking for tips on spin bowling almost 20 years ago has shared the Australian cricket great's response in the wake of his death. Jonathon Stevenson was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter on Friday as a tribute to the 'great man'. 'Wrote to Richie Benaud when I was 16 about bowling leggies. His detailed reply says everything about the great man,' Mr Stevenson, who is now a director at LiveWire Sport, tweeted. Scroll down for video . A letter from Richie Benaud to an English fan, Jonathon Stevenson, almost 20 years ago emerged on Friday in the wake of the cricket legend's death . Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers. 'Your letter was timely because it was the first from a left-hander and it reminded me that there is a difference in coaching and not just in the fact that one youngster might bowl with the right hand and another with the left,' Benaud wrote. 'The ball, although coming out of the hand in the same manner and going in the same direction towards the batsmen, in fact spins differently for the two types of bowlers.' Jonathon Stevenson, who now works at LiveWire Sport, was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter as a tribute to the 'great man' Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers . Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. He was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. 'I hope you enjoy your cricket and your bowling,' Benaud said. 'Yes, the left-arm over-the-wrist bowler who spins the ball into the right-hander from outside the off-stump is said to have bowled a Chinaman. The same bowler who spins one away from the right-hander has bowled a wrong'un.' After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia . The typed letter, dated September 27, 1996, was personally signed by Benaud . It included tips on different deliveries and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered . In his letter to a young Mr Stevenson, he listed a full page of various different deliveries the teenager should try and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered.

"A mummified monk who is believed to have lived for 102 years has become a major tourist attraction after he was put in a crystal display case sitting in the traditional lotus position of prayer. Buddhist Wu Yunqing was preserved wearing a golden cloak and beads in 1998 at Lingquan Temple in central China's Anyang City. Now 17 years on, his facial features and wispy beard are still clearly visible, the People's Daily Online reports. Macabre attraction: Buddhist monk Wu Yunqing was preserved at Lingquan Temple in Anyang . Records show that his parents died he was 15-years-old, leading him to run away to became a monk in Shanxi Yanan Qing Hua Temple. When Wu Yunqing passed away his disciples placed his body in the lotus position and sealed it inside a large porcelain vase with cement. The body was later taken out and placed beneath a crystal glass cover in the Wu Yunqing Memorial Garden at Linquan temple. Then and now: Buddhist Wu Yunqing, pictured left, looks remarkably similar 17-years after his death after he was mummified . Self-mummification was a way to preserve a person’s body after death and was practised in various areas of the world including Asia. Earlier this year, mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position were unearthed in Mongolia with experts estimating the human relic was 200 years old. The amazing mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position were unearthed in Mongolia . Mummified remains of a monk were also found encased in a Buddha statue dating back to the 11th or 12th Century after a CT scan and endoscopy were carried out by Drents Museum at Meander Medical Centre in the Netherlands. It led to hundreds of villagers signing a petition demanding the return of the relic which they believe was stolen in 1995 from Spring Village in eastern China's Fujian province. The mummified remains were discovered at the end of February after he took the statue to the museum in the Netherlands to be restored. According to various Chinese media, the Dutch collector said he is willing to return the Buddha statue if it is proved to be the one stolen from Fujian. A Buddha statue (left) containing a mummified monk (right) was stolen from a village temple twenty years ago, Chinese experts believe . Zhu Guosheng, a mummification master who has preserved the bodies of dozens of monks since 1990s, told Guangzhou Daily that a large porcelain vase is the key to the success of the Buddhist tradition. 'The process can be divided into resting the body in the vase, sealing the body in the vase and opening the vase,’ said Mr Zhu. To help with the preservation, a variety of ingredients are put into the vase, such as ground lime, shredded wood, coal and sandalwood. The body is usually kept in the container for three years before being taken out. Mr Zhu said if it's not rotten, then the deceased monk will potentially be wrapped under a layer of gold foil and turned into

"The money keeps growing but the odds are shortening as the richest fight of all time looks set to break the half-billion-dollar barrier. Both Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are impressing video-watchers and hand-picked visitors to their gyms in Las Vegas and Los Angeles respectively with their dedication and work rate. But a dramatic improvement in the speed and power of the PacMan’s sparring and pad-hitting in the ring have caught the eye of the so-called ‘smart money’ gamblers. Floyd Mayweather's fight with Manny Pacquiao on May 2 is set to break the half-billion-dollar barrier . Pacquiao, who was a 3/1 shot when betting opened, is now down to 2/1 at best. Mayweather, a red-hot odds-on favourite at 2/7 at the start has cooled to 2/3. Some Vegas casinos are predicting what they call a ‘pick ‘em’ even money fight come the big night on May 2. Our best tip at the moment: If you fancy Mayweather get someone to place your bet in Manilla. If you want to back Pacquiao, try Vegas. An improvement in Pacquiao's sparring in the ring has seen 'smart money' gamblers backing him .

DeGale meets Andre Dirrell in Chicago in May for the IBF title vacated by Froch, who beat the American in Nottingham. Froch says: ‘James has not yet proved himself for a fight with me but if he can beat Dirrell it would become more interesting for me to face him.

"(CNN)It's one of the most famous faces in history, even though no one really knows what he looked like. Instead, every culture, every generation, remakes Jesus in its own image. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior when America was mostly Anglo-Protestant, at least in Hollywood's eyes. An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean. If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer. Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from ""Killing Jesus,"" a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. ""A.D.,"" NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries ""The Bible,"" and ""Finding Jesus,"" CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare. Does God have a prayer in Hollywood? What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business, is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood. Haaz Sleiman, from ""Killing Jesus,"" was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians, who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in ""Finding Jesus."" And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in ""A.D.,"" replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed ""hot Jesus,"" by some, ""smarmy Jesus"" by others. You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past. But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say. ""Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed,"" said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of ""Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ."" ""A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India,"" Humphries-Books continued. ""That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways."" The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in. Each of the Jesus shows drew big ratings, which means you'll likely be seeing more of Christ as you channel surf. But according to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong: his flowing locks. Real men don't

"A barrister and Oxford University graduate who spent more than two years avoiding paying for his train ticket could be the biggest fare-dodger to be prosecuted, a court heard. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over a two-and-a-half year period. He travelled from his Oxfordshire home to London Marylebone but pretended to have only gone from Wembley, in north west London. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over two-and-a-half years . Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year . The Australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to £9,714.40 in fares, claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket, and take into account annual leave. But prosecutor Malachy Pakenham told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'If it is accepted that the loss was £23,000, this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the United Kingdom. 'The Crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it. 'The train company are experts, not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed, you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket, you calculate it on a full single fare, of the return for the day, each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket'. Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year. Barnett claimed to have travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire . The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. The Rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from Wembley, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a £550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. The lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children's charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at 'promoting prosperity'. A court heard how the barrister got off at London Marylebone (pictured) by tapping out with an Oyster card . It is understood he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket, and then getting off at Marylebone by simply tapping out with an Oyster card.

"(CNN)Her murder shocked a nation, but according to the slain woman's father, it also woke Turkey up. Ozgecan Aslan's body was found last month, burned and abandoned, just days after her family reported her missing. She allegedly fought off a sexual assault before being killed by the driver of a bus she'd taken to go home. Her death sparked widespread protests. ""A country woke up,"" Aslan's father, Mehmet Aslan, told CNN in a phone interview. ""There was no way for so many people to come together over a single killing. But, I know that my Ozgecan was sent for a reason. And as devastating it is, it was her part, her destiny to wake people up."" Aslan, 20, was a first-year university student. She studied psychology. ""My Ozge lived for peace,"" her father said. ""For peace, love and beauty. She believed in a better tomorrow."" Since her death, hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets and online, demanding Turkey do more to protect women. They say the problem is cultural; it's also criminal. Bianet, a Turkish group that tracks violence against women, reports that at least 281 women were killed in Turkey in 2014 -- up 31% from the previous year. According to Hulya Gulbahar, a Turkish activist and women's rights lawyer, laws are irregularly applied. ""In a majority of Turkey's female abuse cases, the perpetrators receive mitigations in their sentences due to court's detection of consent granted by the victim,"" Gulbahar said. ""In some cases, wearing a miniskirt or some cleavage got the woman's rapist mitigation in his punishment, while in some cases the consent was attached to her wearing red."" It's unclear what will happen in Aslan's case. Three suspects have been arrested in her death, Turkey's semiofficial news agency Anadolu has reported. The agency identified the main suspect as 26-year-old Ahmet Suphi Altindoken and said that he had confessed. Aslan reportedly fought him using pepper spray, which had been given to her by her mother. Although he is heartbroken and angry, Mehmet Aslan isn't out for revenge. In fact, his family has received donations from across the country and is planning to use those to set up a rehabilitation center -- not for women who are abused but for men who abuse. ""We must surrender to love,"" he told CNN. ""Otherwise, we all lose."" Aslan's murder is similar in many ways to well-known case in India. There, a student was attacked by five men on a public bus in 2012. She was raped and later died from her injuries. Like Aslan's murder, her death triggered massive outrage and nationwide protests. And like Turkey, India has a serious problem when it comes to women's rights. Out of 142 countries, Turkey ranks 125th (India ranks 114th) on the World Economic Forum's 2014 gender gap index. On Sunday, some 3,000 women marched in Istanbul to mark International Women's Day, Anadolu reported. The female-only rally was dedicated in Aslan's memory. ""Ozgecan's screams have indeed been heard.

Dowling 'was escorted from the building' on February 13, reports The Washington Post.

Within an hour of the first lady's official confirmation, Dowling also felt compelled to release a statement about her sudden departure weeks before. 'After almost six years as Chief Floral Designer at the White House, I have resigned in order to pursue exciting new opportunities and explore my passion for floral artistry and design,' said Dowling in a statement issued by heavyweight law firm Sidley Austin. The first lady's office released a statement on Tuesday which praised the work of florist Laura Dowling who had unexpectedly departed her post more than a month before . 'Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be launching a new platform for my work as an author, speaker, instructor and design consultant that builds on the creative ideas and partnerships I've formed during my tenure there. 'It's been such an honor to work at the White House and I will always be grateful for this incredible opportunity.' But Dowling's unexpected departure and the sudden release of two statements more than a month later has prompted speculation that all was not well between Dowling and the first lady. Several unnamed floral designers who continue to provide bouquets to the White House told the Post that Dowling left because her 'fussy style' wasn't in keeping with the first lady's desire for a modern and clean aesthetic. When Dowling was first appointed she was highly regarded for her organic and less formal 'French look,' but now that seems to have fallen out of favor at the White House. Just days before the florist's departure, the Old Family Dining Room had been re-opened after being refurbished by the First Lady to showcase modern art and design, according to the White House

"Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres believes coach Diego Simeone's clear understanding of the team's weaknesses has been the key to their success as they seek revenge against Real Madrid on Tuesday for last season's Champions League final defeat. With the determined Argentine at the helm, Atletico have belied their economic inferiority to become one of the most dangerous sides in Europe and now the La Liga champions take on Real aiming once again for a place in the semi-finals of the continent's elite competition. In the past Atletico were accustomed to being swept aside by the footballing aristocrats, who claimed their 10th European crown against them in Lisbon, but now they are more than capable of trading blows. Fernando Torres (centre) scored his first ever league own goal during the 2-2 draw with Malaga on Saturday . Torres has praised the coaching style of Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone (centre) In fact since that final, when Atletico were agonisingly close to a victory before a Sergio Ramos header forced extra-time and then Real ran away with the match, Simeone's side has had the upper hand in the Madrid clashes. Atletico beat Real to win the season's Super Cup curtain-raiser, knocked them out of the King's Cup and defeated them in both La Liga clashes. The manner of their 4-0 demolition of Real in February's league meeting even led to questions about the future of coach Carlo Ancelotti. 'It is his character as a player and his character as a coach that drives the team,' Torres told UEFA.com of Simeone. Antoine Griezmann scored twice to help Diego Simeone's side scrape to a 2-2 draw on Saturday .

'We don't have the options that Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern (Munich) or Chelsea have, we cannot drop points and make up for them later. We are a team that plays at our limit.' The pressure is very much on Ancelotti going into the game with Real having surrendered their La Liga lead and dropping two points behind Barcelona. Even so there are positive signs with the team finding its form in recent weeks following the return of Luka Modric and James Rodriguez from injury. Cristiano Ronaldo is also firing on all cylinders with eight goals from four games.

"A niece of one of the victims of the Germanwings crash is haunted by the 'atrocious' thought that her uncle spent the last eight minutes of his life knowing he was going to die. Sandrine Driessens, niece of 59-year-old Belgian father and grandfather Christian Driessens, said that the thought was 'very hard'. 'My uncle certainly knew that he was living his last moments and it's very hard to hear that the descent of the aircraft lasted eight minute,' she told La Provence newspaper. Scroll down for video . Loving: Christian Driessens, 59, pictured second from right, was a keen traveller. He was killed when the Germanwings A320 crashed in the Alps on Tuesday . Happy: Although Christian Driessens' niece said she was haunted by the idea that he knew he was going to die for eight minutes while the plane was descending, an aviation expert has said that it is more likely that the passengers and crew were calm and did not realise that they were in mortal danger . 'For eight long minutes, he was dying. This is atrocious! I dare not imagine the horror of parents who tried to protect their babies in this airplane.' But a veteran A320 pilot has said that the passengers would have been unlikely to know that they were going to die. If anything, he said, the plane would have been filled with 'eerie silence'. 'It is likely that there was a problem with the pilots, as they put the plane into descent but failed to control it,' said Tony Newton, who is also an examiner for Britain's Civil Aviation Authority. 'The aircraft descended at fairly normal rate, in a fairly normal way. It was steep, but I have used steeper descents on a regular basis. It was well within the everyday operation and not in any way terrifying.' It is likely the oxygen masks were released, he said, and if passengers did not put them on quickly enough they may have lost consciousness. There also may have been 'unpleasant noises and wind effects', which may have caused some alarm. But the plane was not 'tumbling out of the sky in a screaming dive'. 'The crew was probably sitting there waiting for the pilot to complete the descent,' he said. 'There was probably no indication to passengers of what the end was going to be. 'There may have been some panic when they saw the mountains coming up through the windows, but it would have been brief. 'Either way, in my experience, passengers tend to stay absolutely silent during an emergency. 'It's not a Hollywood panic, it's an eerie silence.' Mr Driessens, born in Kinshasha, had returned to Belgium in 1960 and lived in Couvin and Mons. After meeting his Catalan born wife, Monserat Domingo, the couple settled down in Palleja, 25 km from Barcelona. They had three sons aged 17 to 31, and three grandchildren. 'He was a wonderful man who loved his family above all,' said Ms Driessens. 'For more than 30 years he travelled almost weekly in his job. But in this

"The heartbroken mother of a unarmed teen who was shot dead by police has revealed the last words her son spoke as he lay dying in an ambulance. Hector Morejon was shot by a Long Beach, California, police officer, who allegedly thought the 19-year-old was pointing a gun at him during a trespassing and vandalism incident. According to her attorney, his mother, Lucia Morejon, was at home when she heard the shots. Lucia Morejon, the heartbroken mother of a unarmed teen who was shot dead by police has revealed the last words her son, Hector Morejon, 19, spoke as he lay dying in an ambulance . She went to an alley near her home to see what happened and then realized it was her son in the ambulance, reports the LA Times. 'When he saw her, he propped himself partially up and cried to her, 'Mommy, Mommy, please come, please come!' ' her attorney's statement said, reports the Press Telegram. 'She walked towards the ambulance, identified herself as his mother, expecting to ride with him to the hospital, but was pushed back by a man in a blue uniform.' Her attorney Sonia Mercado told The Huffington Post: 'He was reaching for her - reaching out to her for help.' 'It's a tough thing to live with as a parent,' said Mercado. 'She is deeply in shock.' Hector Morejon, 19, was shot dead by a police officer on Thursday while in a vacant apartment . The Press Telegram reports that according to the statement, Lucia Morejon asked what happened but was not given any information. It continues: 'At the hospital, Mrs. Mojeron and her family were not allowed to see Hector until he was dead.' In a statement released Monday, the family of Hector Morejon said they are requesting that the LBPD 'immediately release the name and badge number of the officer who is responsible for killing Hector who was unarmed.' Police said officers received a report that several people were trespassing and vandalizing an empty apartment at about 2:45 p.m. Thursday. When they attended they saw there was an open window and a broken window. According to an LBPD press release, an officer looked into the apartment through the broken window and saw a man (later identified as Morejon) standing against a wall. The press release states the officer saw the man turn toward him, while bending his knees and extending his arm out, as if pointing an object which the officer perceived as a gun. The officer then fired, according to police. Morejon,from Long Beach, was initially listed in critical condition, but was later pronounced dead at a hospital. No weapons were found at the scene. 'Objects were collected from the scene, but it has not been yet determined at this point in the investigation if those objects were what the officer observed,' said Sgt. Megan Zabel, a Police Department spokeswoman told the LA Times. 'We are not describing evidentiary detail on what those objects are at this time, as with how many times the suspect was shot.'

"England full back Mike Brown is still showing signs of concussion and may not play again until the World Cup warm-up matches in August. Nine weeks after being knocked out in the RBS 6 Nations Test against Italy, Brown is still suffering from headaches and has taken no part in training or team meetings since he returned to Harlequins. Conor O'Shea, Harlequins director of rugby, has ruled the 29-year-old out of Saturday's Aviva Premiership match against Sale and he is not expected to face Bath the following week. England star Mike Brown could miss the rest of the season after failing to recover from concussion . Brown was taken off after clashing with Italy's Andrea Masi during the Six Nations match in February . Brown has continued to suffer headaches nine weeks after his injury and has been advised not to play . 'He has headaches throughout the day,' explained O'Shea. 'He's frustrated because he wants to help his team-mates. What's even more frustrating is he can't contribute in meetings. He can't even be in the room to help people because we're sending him home to get himself right. I want to see Mike Brown right when he is in his 50s, not when he is in his prime.' Brown was knocked cold in an accidental collision during England's 47-17 victory over Italy at Twickenham in February and forced to leave the field. He missed the next game against Ireland but played against Scotland and in the championship decider against France after which he admitted he 'didn't feel quite right'. Assuming Harlequins do not reach the Champions Cup play-offs, Brown's last chance to feature before the end of the season will be in the final-round fixture against Newcastle. 'You can't rule out the possibility that he might not play again this season,' said O'Shea. 'Do I think he'll be right for Bath? I don't think so. Do I think we're looking at Newcastle? Yes, but if he's not right then, he's not right.' Feb 14: Knocked out in 13th minute of England's RBS 6 Nations fixture against Italy following huge collision with Andrea Masi. Feb 25: Ruled out of England's Test against Ireland after failing to come through the necessary safety tests. Mar 14: Played 76 minutes in England's Calcutta Cup victory over Scotland. Mar 21: Played full game in England's final-round victory over France. Mar 23: Stood down by club medical staff on day of his return to Harlequins. Cleared to have a week-long holiday in Dubai to aid recovery. Mar 28: Sidelined for Aviva Premiership match against Saracens. Apr 11: Sidelined for Aviva Premiership match against Gloucester. Brown, who is not even allowed to train on an indoor bike until he is symptom free, is England head coach Stuart Lancaster's first-choice full back going into the World Cup and O'Shea backs the player to regain his form quickly. England play a double-header against France in August, before facing Ireland in their third and final warm-up fixture in September. 'He'll have the World Cup warm-ups and he'll be fine,' said O'Shea.

Second visit: Heather Mack, facing a death sentence if she is convicted of murdering her mother, took her new-born baby daughter (pictured) back to hospital on Friday after the child still showed signs of illness . Improper treatment: Doctors are reported to have been shocked at the lack of motherly attention shown to baby Stella and a prison source said medical staff were appalled at the baby's dirty condition . 'The mother appears not to have been washing her properly, if at all, ' the source told Dailymail.com exclusively. It is understood there are concerns that because the baby has not been kept clean the area where the umbilical cord was cut might become infected. 'The baby's high fever is more of a concern than the jaundice,' said the source. Miss Mack, 19, obtained permission from the Bali Prosecutor’s office to return, under guard, to the Sanglah Hospital - where she gave birth to Stella Schaefer last week - after pleading for the baby to receive ‘proper hospital treatment’. After baby Stella developed a high fever and her skin took on a yellowish colour - an indication of jaundice - the child was taken on Wednesday to the clinic inside the walls of Kerobokan prison.

"Sneaky tactics used by airlines, banks and insurance companies to trick millions of customers into buying extra insurance could soon be outlawed. The City watchdog has said it wants to ban companies from ‘opt out’ selling – where customers have to untick a box in the small print if they want to avoid buying an add-on insurance policy. In a damning report, the Financial Conduct Authority said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need. The Financial Conduct Authority said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need . Those that fall into the trap - whether they are buying a concert ticket or paying for car insurance - are more likely to buy inappropriate products, or receive poor value for money. The FCA estimates the scam is costing customers more than £108 million a year in overpayments. The market for such products - including identity theft protection, home insurance and breakdown cover – is worth an estimated £1billion a year to the insurance industry. They are typically sold alongside insurance such as travel, car and home cover. But just under a fifth of customers are not even aware they have them, according to the FCA. The sale of add-on products has already given rise to the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, where millions of customers were sold policies they did not want or need alongside loans or credit cards. High street banks and other lenders have paid out £18billion in compensation so far – making it the most expensive mis-selling scandal in UK history. The sneaky tactics are used by airlines and banks with products - including identity theft protection, home insurance and breakdown cover - typically sold alongside travel and car insurance and home cover . Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA said: ‘This is about ensuring consumers can make the right decision on what add-on insurance they do or don’t need. Forgetting to untick a box at the end of a purchase is not making an informed choice.’ Similar tactics are used by firms to barrage customers with junk mail and marketing. The ban would apply to add-on sales of all products alongside financial primary policies - meaning the insurance policy or loan that the customer intended to buy in the first place. Paying out: The FCA estimates the scam is costing customers more than £108 million a year in overpayments . Key examples include key cover sold alongside motor insurance, or protection cover when taking out a mortgage or credit card. The City watchdog also wants firms to inform customers about add-on policies earlier in the sales process – rather than just before they make the purchase - so they can make an informed choice and shop around. Existing rules are already meant to protect customers who are buying an add-on financial policy alongside a non financial product such as a plane ticket. The sale of insurance add-ons is hugely lucrative, with insurance companies making bumper profits. According to a separate study

"As the scorer of Gibraltar’s first-ever competitive goal, it was little wonder that history-maker Lee Casciaro felt like a Rock star when he left Hampden Park on Sunday night. However, as the 33-year-old Ministry of Defence policeman would later reveal, he was not the first man from the tiny British overseas territory to make an arresting impact at the National Stadium. If the outstanding memory of the 2002 Champions League Final for most people remains Zinedine Zidane’s exquisite volleyed goal, in Gibraltar it was the sight of local businessman Joe Beriro invading the park clad in a kilt and a Real Madrid strip. Gibraltar's players celebrate after Lee Casciaro scored their first ever competitive goal on Sunday . Beriro would later appear on Gibraltar’s version of Strictly Come Dancing, before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye. His place as the most famous man in Gibraltar now passes to Casciaro after criminal defending by Scotland allowed the cop to race clear, fire low past David Marshall and utterly stun Hampden. For the striker, all the years spent pounding the hard yards on pavements and playing in sub-standard facilities were worth it as he followed in the famous footsteps of Zidane by scoring a goal to remember in Mount Florida. Casciaro (centre) celebrates the goal that will have made him the most famous man in Gibraltar . ‘It was a Gibraltarian who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his Madrid shirt in that Champions League Final in 2002. I remember that well,’ he beamed. ‘It was just a dream come true for me to score that goal. It’s unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for Gibraltar. ‘I don’t think I will get a hero’s reception when I get home. We still lost the game – but it is still an achievement to get the goal. Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba celebrates the goal at Hampden Park, which levelled the score at 1-1 . ‘We have only just joined UEFA and started to train on a football pitch. All my life, we’ve been training wherever we can, running on the road, or for 90 minutes a week on a seven-a-side pitch. ‘Even two or three years ago I didn’t think I would be playing for Gibraltar because I didn’t think we would get into UEFA. Everything has happened so fast and we are learning every day. ‘This goal is something that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I knew it was going in as soon as I hit it. It was a great feeling. ‘I swapped my second shirt with Ikechi Anya but I kept my shirt from the first half. I am going to put it up in my house! But I’m hoping there are more goals to come for me in future.’ Casciaro (right) vies for the ball with Scotland's Ikechi Anya, who he later swapped shirts with . Despite ultimately losing 6-1 to Gordon Strachan’s side, Casciaro hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions

"The fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation, but people in this South Carolina city aren't surprised. They call it inevitable in a police department they believe focuses on petty crimes and fails to keep its officers in check. There is almost nothing in Michael Thomas Slager's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light. People in the community he served say this reflects what's going wrong with policing today: Officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain. Scroll down for video . Residents of the Charleston, South Carolina, have said the shooting of unarmed black driver Walter Scott was preceded by previous unheeded complaints about the police. Above, a friend of Scott's at a memorial . The officer who shot Scott, Michael Slager, had little in his file to suggest excessive force. Above, two men pray at the memorial . 'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday. The mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases. Nationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said. 'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.' Both Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence. Video captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away . Original statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident . A dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light . Slager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police. His new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.' Slager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family

"Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp feels he still has plenty to offer football but only at the right club, having turned down a 'mind-blowing' offer to coach abroad. The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'. Redknapp will return to the dugout on Sunday, May 31 when he leads a star-studded Men United XI against Leyton Orient Legends, as O's youth coach and Prostate Cancer UK ambassador Errol McKellar hosts a charity football match at The Matchroom Stadium. Harry Redknapp (right) says he would consider a return to management as long as it's at the right club . Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match . The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me.

Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago . The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time . 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently

"Paul Casey insists he is desperate to play in the Ryder Cup again, even though he looks unlikely to rejoin the European Tour in time to earn qualifying points this season. Only Tour members can play on the team and Phoenix-based Casey gave up his membership after deciding in January to concentrate on the PGA Tour in order to get back into the world's top 50. The move has paid off with the former world No 3 losing a play-off in the Northern Trust Open and finishing joint third in the Honda Classic to climb to 44th at the start of this week. Paul Casey, practicing ahead of the Masters in Augusta, 'desperately' wants to return to the Ryder Cup . The Englishman has returned to the world's top 50 after leaving the European Tour to concentrate on his game . However, even if he rejoins the European Tour before the May 1 deadline to be eligible to accrue Ryder Cup points when the race starts in August, he will struggle to play the 13 events required for membership. 'It was very straightforward when I was top 10 in the world playing both tours,' Casey told Sportsmail ahead of his first Masters appearance since 2012. 'I know I am back in the top 50 but I have only just got back into the top 50. It was a very difficult decision but it was also the correct decision. 'I still have to play 13 events and right now I am not in the US Open or Open or HBSC Champions at the end of the year. Playing 13 becomes difficult when you haven't played at the start of the year in Middle East.' Casey celebrates while watching a replay of his hole-in-one, which helped Europe to victory in 2006 . Casey last played in the Ryder Cup competition in the 2008 defeat by USA at Valhalla . Casey played in the record Ryder Cup wins in 2004 and 2006 and the 2008 defeat at Valhalla, but was in tears after being overlooked for a wild card by captain Colin Montgomerie in 2010, when he was ranked seventh in the world. 'I desperately want to be part of a Ryder Cup again. There is definitely passion and a fire there burning,' he added. 'Certainly one of them I felt like I was maybe denied, the others I haven't been in a position to make the team and watching Medinah and Gleneagles has been brilliant. 'What they have done has been absolutely phenomenal and I want to be part of that again and not just part of it, but a real solid team player and leader in the team room, which I know I can be. When I play my best golf I think I can certainly play that kind of role.' European captain Darren Clarke said earlier this week he wanted Casey on his team for Hazeltine next year, and the 37-year-old added: 'Paul (McGinley) said the same thing (even though I was a member of the Tour at the time).

"MP for North West Leicestershire Andrew Bridgen . Teachers should be forced to sit A-level exams along with their pupils, an MP has suggested. Andrew Bridgen wants the Conservative Party to put the proposal in its manifesto and has discussed the issue with Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. Teaching unions have previously cautioned against the move, but Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said the change was a logical way to drive-up educational standards. He said: 'My idea would be to have the teacher sit the exam themselves, along with the students. 'After all, how can they be expected to pass on their knowledge to students to allow them to succeed in the exam, if they themselves could not? 'This would help improve teaching standards because if a teacher did poorly, this could be looked into and their skills improved upon.' His comments came as it emerged that Michael Gove still plays a leading role in shaping the Government's education policy, according to the Schools Minister. David Laws said the Conservative Chief Whip, who was moved from the Department of Education in last summer's cabinet reshuffle, joins Number 10 and the Treasury in dictating policy rather than education secretary Nicky Morgan. Ms Morgan has previously denied reports Mr Gove was 'back seat driving' as 'nonsense' but Mr Laws, her Liberal Democrat deputy, appeared to undermine her picture of a united front. He told the Independent: 'While Nicky Morgan's instincts are moderate, the people who control education policy in the Conservative Party are still Michael Gove, David Cameron and George Osborne. The Tory MP thinks teachers should sit the exams alongside their pupils to improve standards (file picture) 'The face and language may have changed but the Tory policies haven't.' Last month the Labour Party said that headteachers would receive business and leadership coaching under plans aimed at raising standards and improving management of multi-million pound school budgets. Morgan claimed recently that teachers are ‘working far too hard, for far too long’ and has promised to slash their workload. The Education Secretary lined up with Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg to propose ways to lighten the burden on school staff. This includes not making alterations to qualifications in the academic year or during a course unless in ‘exceptional circumstances’.

Devin M. Gesell, 17, is accused of breaking into the home in St Peter’s, Missouri, in November with two others - a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old who can not be named for legal reasons. The trio thought they had come across a stash of cocaine and took it from the house along with a necklace worth $500, a Xbox 360 game system, bottles of prescription drugs oxycodone and morphine, and over $800 in cash, reports the St. Louis Post- Dispatch. But when they tasted the ashes, which were in a wooden box, they realized their mistake - and threw the homeowner's father's ashes out of the car. Gessel later told the police they could not remember where they threw them out so police have not been able to retrieve them. According to police, the three knew the family who lived at the home and planned the burglary after seeing a Facebook post which indicated they were going to be away. But they were caught after police tracked them through an IP address used on the Xbox. Gesell was charged this week with burglary and two counts of theft. He told police he acted as lookout as the other two went through the house after breaking in through the back door. His bail is set at $10,000 cash-only.

Given has been selected each round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and Sherwood said he would keep faith with his deputy goalkeeper. Brad Guzan, Villa’s No 1, suffered heartbreak in 2010, when he was understudy to Brad Friedel but played every round of the League Cup – before being left out of the final against Manchester United by manager Martin O’Neill.

This club’s relegation is not at stake on Sunday it is about us maybe getting some glory for the football club. ‘We have the mindest to win the game, impose ourselves on a very good Liverpool side, that’s what we intend to do. ‘We think we’re capable, we have a good blend of players who can play and maybe go direct at time.

"It is always revealing to see how players respond to adversity and Joe Root has reacted magnificently to being left out of last year’s Sydney Test. I can remember players left out when I played having a moan in the dressing room and spouting nonsense about how they did not fit in. What Root has done is have a look at himself, stay quiet and then produce hundred after hundred to ensure he will not be left out in a hurry again. Joe Root showed plenty of grit, as well as talent, in yet another big innings for England . Root has bounced back from a difficult Ashes Tour to prove himself as a quality Test batsman . Around four years ago I remember sitting next to Graham Thorpe on a bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young English batsman to watch out for was Joe Root. He was barely heard of then. How right Thorpe was, for what Root has done since Sydney speaks volumes about the character of the bloke. Do not be fooled by the boyish grin and cheeky demeanour. He is as steely as they come, a fierce competitor who loves playing for England. He tells himself every day that he must enjoy the game but that takes nothing away from the quality of his magnificent performances. His last five hundreds have been in excess of 149, four of them have been unbeaten and in the way he batted with Jimmy Anderson yesterday he showed he has a very good cricket brain. And he hasn’t messed with his form either. It would be easy in his current run to chip up a catch on 40 or give it away as soon as he reaches a hundred, as Marlon Samuels did in the first innings here. I love the way Root goes big. Before his partner was foolishly run out, Root showed maturity to bat with the tail on Friday in Grenada . The young batsman has been superb in his middle-order role, and should not be moved up the batting card . Part of me sees Root as a natural No 3, where England tried him in Australia. He looks like a batsman who could come in and regain the initiative if you lose an early wicket. But why move him when he is going so well at five? Keep him there. Eventually he will captain England and five is a good place to captain from. The only problem in seeing him as a future England captain is that do we want to put our best player in charge when his runs are so important? Look at Alastair Cook and just about every England captain in history. It wears them all down in the end and when the day eventually comes that England need a new leader they will have to think about that. His fabulous form should be enough to see Root left to do what he does best - score runs for England . Alastair Cook (right) has shown the danger of making

"Are you curious and creative but a bit standoffish? Then you're probably a Londoner. Think of yourself as more dependable and down to earth? You may well live in the Midlands. And if you pride yourself on your friendliness and ability to stay calm in a crisis, you're most likely to be Scottish. This is according to experts at Cambridge University, who have marked out a personality map of the whole of Britain. Revealed: The moody map of Britain details the country's most and least friendly inhabitants . The profile revealed that inhabitants of the capital are the least welcoming of all. The Welsh also fare badly, with the researchers declaring them to be exceptionally shy and neurotic. The Scots, however, can hold their heads high, as they are the friendliest and most emotionally stable people in Britain. To find out what where we live says about us, psychologists asked almost 400,000 Britons a series of questions designed to assess five key personality traits. They then looked to see how common each of the five characteristics – agreeableness, extraversion, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism – was in each of the 380 council areas in England, Scotland and Wales. Characteristics: People in the Midlands were among the most conscientious (left), suggesting that like residents of the Scottish Highlands, they are dependable, reliable types. Meanwhile those who lived in the capital scored highly on extraversion (right), as did the people of Manchester . Mapped out: The Scots scored highest in agreeableness (left), which covers friendliness, trust, co-operation and concern about others. The Scots also emerged as the least neurotic (right) and the most calm and contented. The colour red means a greater level of an attribute, while blue is for the opposite . New experiences: Inhabitants of the East Midlands and the east of England were the least open – leading to them being labelled 'conventional, down to earth and traditional' The result is a fascinating, and at times controversial, snapshot of the psychology of Britain. The Scots scored highest in agreeableness. The first of the five traits polled, it covers friendliness, trust, co-operation and concern about others. People in Devon, Somerset, East Anglia and Yorkshire are also highly agreeable sorts. And at the other end of the scale are the residents of London, who were found to be the least friendly of all. Rather than being warm and welcoming, they are likely to be uncooperative, quarrelsome and irritable, the journal PLOS ONE reports. Those who lived in the capital, however, scored highly on extraversion, as did the people of Manchester. In contrast, those living in the Scottish Highlands and parts of Lincolnshire were among the most quiet and reserved. Londoners fared badly in the study - they were found to be among some of Britain's least friendly residents . City-dwellers also did well on another trait, openness. This is a measure of curiosity, imagination and intellect, and was particularly high in London, Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton, Bristol, Manchester and Glasgow.

The bequests in these bizarre wills also include one from a father who wanted his step-daughter to receive the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages' after her late mother did not pay her for them. The team at genealogy firm Fraser and Fraser - based in Farringdon, central London - have spent almost half a century compiling a list of the strangest requests they have discovered on wills.

One section reads: 'To Alice Cooke my loving wife, for her to keep or use. Without reserve throughout her life, however she may choose' During that time the experts have dug up scores of unusual passages written on the legal declarations - before whittling these down to a top ten, which have now been revealed. Their discoveries include the 1888 will of boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence. They also found a 'beautifully written' seven-versed poem and a will revealing how a man left money to Christ, as long as He could prove His identity. In another will, 59-year-old Annie Langabeer wanted to give her brother-in-law two shillings and sixpence so he could 'buy a rope' because she wanted him to hang himself.

The boys allegedly told police that they were out playing basketball, and came up with the idea that they wanted to commit a robbery.

"Two months before man set foot on the moon for the first time, Gordon Strachan stood on the Hampden terraces to witness a Halley's Comet moment. Just 12 at the time, he could hardly have known 46 years would pass before a Scotsman scored another international hat-trick. 'I was here when Colin Stein scored four,' said the Scots boss after Steven Fletcher's star turn against Gibraltar. 'It's a long time ago — and a few stone ago — but I was there.' Steven Fletcher celebrates scoring a hat-trick for Scotland in the 6-1 victory over Gibraltar . Fletcher is the first Scotland player to score three goals in a game since Colin Stein in 1969 . Fletcher (right) scored his third goal with a left-footed strike from range for Scotland against Gibraltar . Fletcher was recently mocked on Twitter for buying a Lamborghini after inconsistent form for his club, Sunderland . Shaun Maloney converted a penalty to put Scotland ahead against Gibraltar at Hampden Park on Sunday . Scotland (3-4-3): Marshall 6; Hutton 6, Martin 6, Robertson 5; Ritchie 4 (Greer 46), Brown 6, Maloney 6, Morrison 5, Anya 6 (Bannan 74); Naismith 6 (Rhodes 66), Fletcher 7. Subs not used: Gordon, McGregor, Russell, McArthur, May, Darren Fletcher, Forsyth, Berra, Forrest. Goals: Maloney 18, 34 (both pens), Fletcher, 29, 70, 90, Naismith 39.

Referee: Mattias Gestranius (Finland) The Group D standings after Scotland's 6-1 win vs Gibraltar . He was back again, on Sunday night. The old ash wooden steps are long gone, but the technical area provided an excellent vantage point to watch the landmarks tumble down as heavily as the rain over Glasgow. Fletcher climbed back into his Lamborghini as the first Scotland player to drive home a hat-trick since Stein in an 8-0 win over Cyprus in May 1969. Strachan's team became the first in dark blue to rack up half a dozen goals since a 6-0 thrashing of the Faroes in 2006. And, to prove history comes in all shapes and sizes, David Marshall became the first keeper to lose a goal to the minnows of Gibraltar in a competitive international. 'McGregor and Gordon now love me,' said Strachan, only half joking. 'They think I'm the best manager in the world for not picking them —they're not in the history books.' Rightly, Scotland's boss was quick to hand credit to the visitors. Fletcher took the headlines with his first goals for his country since April 2009, Shaun Maloney scoring two penalties and Steven Naismith the other. Yet this was a patchy, unconvincing performance at times. The Scots won the three points and are still on course in Group D. The Gibraltar team of semi-pro part-timers put together by Scot Davie Wilson made the

"A gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay - in a fight that has cost taxpayers £200,000. The 78 Irish travellers, who hail from just four families, had refused to budge despite facing three different courts, a planning inquiry and a council. And locals in Hardhorn, Lancashire, accused the group of trashing their leafy village - and branded them the 'neighbours from hell'. A gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay . The group claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans . Last October, the camp, which had flouted planning rules, appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal. But despite being given four months to leave the site without the chance to appeal, the group used a loophole to take their case to the Supreme Court. They claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans. The Supreme Court later rejected pleas for the group to be allowed the right of appeal under a 'point of law of general public importance.' But now it has been revealed that a further judicial review at the High Court has been granted. Fylde Council said that fighting the 'Battle of Hardhorn' has already cost the local authority £200,000 in legal fees which will be met by the public purse. Parish councillor Maxine Chew said: 'It is a disgrace that a shocking amount of public money has been spent fighting this. 'The travellers really have been the neighbours from hell. The amount of anti-social behaviour like fly tipping, theft, drunkenness has escalated hugely in the past four years since the travellers set up camp.' The camp (pictured) appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal last year . A village spokesman added: 'After five years five months the travellers site have fought every decision, we believe that they have used legal aid to fight the Secretary of State and Fylde BC. 'The question what we would like to know is how these people qualified for legal aid? Using taxpayers' money to fight the taxpayer!' He added the decision to hold a judicial review on the grounds presented is 'totally wrong'. 'This community will be devastated with this news as we have been so patient and have endured over 450 negative incidents over the five-plus years. 'Over eight caravans set on fire to burn refuse, horses killed & dogs killed on the road from the site, drunken labourers asleep in gardens, police raids and many cases of ASB.

"An axe-wielding robber has been jailed after his attempt to rob a store was foiled when he was jumped on by the shopkeeper and hit by his wife with a baseball bat. Ex-juvenile offender Shaun Andrew McKerry, dubbed Boomerang Boy or Homing Pigeon Boy in his youth, burst into Shildon Post Office and Stores, County Durham, at 8pm on March 15. The masked 31-year-old waved an axe as he demanded cash from terrified assistant Andrea Brighty, but he did not see owner Sab Dhillon's rugby tackle which dropped him to the floor, sending shelves and produce tumbling. Scroll down for video . As the men wrestled, Sab Dhillon's wife Sam helped by hitting McKerry with a baseball bat . She struck him twice, helping to disarm him while her husband twisted him around to reveal his face to the cameras . As the men wrestled, and with McKerry still holding the axe, Mr Dhillon's wife Sam helped, hitting him twice with a baseball bat to make him drop the weapon. Blood can be seen coming from the would-be robber's nose as Mr Dhillon gestures to his wife to drop the bat. Minutes later the police arrived and arrested McKerry. He previously pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court to attempted robbery and court officials confirmed he had been jailed for six years after the hearing today. McKerry, from Coundon near Bishop Auckland, earned the nicknames Boomerang Boy or Homing Pigeon Boy as he always returned home after committing a crime. He started shoplifting at the age of 12 and by 15 he had been arrested 80 times, and had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. McKerry once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. His earned his moniker in the 1990s after he was arrested 80 times in 1995 and 45 times during the 36 weeks he managed to stay out of prison in 1998.

"Robert Durst has been absolved of state gun charges in Louisiana. The ruling on Thursday clears the way for federal proceedings on similar charges in New Orleans, which local lawyers believe he can win. Durst, 72, who faces a murder charge in an unrelated California case, remains jailed without bond in Louisiana. Scroll down for video . Next step: Jailed millionaire Robert Durst has been absolved of state gun charges in Louisiana. He will now face federal charges, which lawyers believe he can win, before a murder trial in California . He was arrested at a hotel in the New Orleans capital in March a day before the finale of his HBO docu-series The Jinx. Authorities said he had a gun and marijuana in his room. Defense Attorney Dick DeGuerin said state and federal prosecutors had been discussing the possibility of the state case being dismissed. He says he was pleased with the decision. 'It makes sense to try this case in federal court because FBI agents arrested Mr. Durst, and there shouldn't be two prosecutions, state and federal, at the same time for the same crime,' DeGuerin said in an email. 'We're looking forward to our day in court.' A spokesman for District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro confirmed the move, saying Cannizzaro has a close working relationship with federal authorities in New Orleans. 'The District Attorney did reserve the right to look at the case again upon its conclusion in federal court,' assistant prosecutor Christopher Bowman said. Durst had faced state charges of possessing a handgun with drugs and illegal possession of a handgun by a felon. Legal battle: The 72-year-old was arrested in March the day before the finale of an HBO docu-series about him . Durst (right) was arrested for the murder of his friend and writer Susan Berman (left) in 2000, which some believe he may have committed to stop her from talking to authorities about the disappearance of his wife . Durst, the heir to a vast real estate fortune before becoming estranged from his family, is also connected to the 1982 disappearance of first wife Kathy McCormack (left, with Durst) and the killing of Morris Black (right) The charge in the federal indictment says Durst violated the federal gun-control act because he was in possession of a firearm after being convicted of earlier felonies. His lawyers say the arrest in mid-March was timed to mesh with the finale of The Jinx, HBO's six-part series about Durst, his wife's disappearance, Berman's death, and the death and dismemberment of Durst's neighbor Morris Black in 2001. Authorities found more than $44,000 in Durst's hotel room, according to legal papers filed Wednesday. After his arrest, they intercepted a package containing personal items and $117,000 that was sent to the hotel for Everette Ward — the name Durst used to register there. During a hearing last month, a prosecutor said the package of $100 bills, a head-and-chest latex mask and a map folded to show Louisiana, Florida and Cuba were evidence that Durst was likely to flee if bond was set for

The former secretary of state was banking $300,000 for paid appearances before she ditched the speaking circuit for an offensive on the White House. The average CEO's hourly rate is $54,213, the Washington Examiner, pointed out. She makes more on the days she's paid a premium to give remarks than big wigs of the likes of Ralph Lauren, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners co-founder Richard Kinder and former Vornado president and CEO Michael Fascitelli.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) on Nasa's Terra and Aqua satellites took images spanning the calving event. B-34 is the 34th iceberg from the 'B' quadrant of Antarctica to be tracked by the NIC. The new berg is still smaller, however, than the much older B-15T- a fragment of B-15 that initially broke off from the Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000. The first image (left) shows the iceberg on February 16, when it was still attached to the ice shelf. By February 28 (middle), it appears to have separated somewhat. By March 5 (right), it is floating freely . B-34 is the 34th iceberg from the 'B' quadrant of Antarctica to be tracked by the NIC. Glaciers in this region are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels . Large icebergs can have large-scale impacts on the Southern Ocean. For example, as the bergs melt, the addition of cold, fresh water to the saltwater ocean can affect ocean currents and circulation. Researchers have shown, however, that even more fresh water comes from the melting of smaller and much more numerous bergs. The Amundsen Sea has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the West Antarctic. A study published in December suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago. Researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in West Antarctica, which contain enough water to raise sea levels by at least a metre, may be irreversible. The findings of the 21-year study by Nasa and the University of California, Irvine claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Scientists found the rate by taking radar, laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers' mass between 1992 and 2013. They found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year (91.5 billion U.S. tons), or the equivalent of losing the water weight of Mount Everest every two years. Scientists

"Mark Robson, 44, had half his foot amputated after he cut it while swimming on a holiday to Egypt . A father lost half his foot and all his toes after cutting himself in a swimming pool while on holiday. Mark Robson suffered a serious bone infection in the years after the injury, forcing doctors to operate. He had to give up his job after the accident as can no longer drive and struggles with basic household tasks. The 44-year-old had been swimming in a pool in the popular Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh when he gashed his toe. Despite the injury healing quickly, when Mr Robson returned to the UK medics said he had a bone infection and prescribed antibiotics. But in the five years after the accident, the infection returned repeatedly and doctors were forced to carry out a series of operations. They eventually had to amputate half his foot and his toes, leaving him needing to be cared for by his family. As a result, he launched legal proceedings against Thomson's Tropicana Jasmine Hotel, where he was injured. He has now won a £25,000 payout to help with everyday life, and is now calling on Thomson to improve safety measures at its resorts. The father-of-one, of Shiremoor, North Tyneside, said: 'The impact this whole issue has had on me has been devastating. 'As well as having no choice but to leave work, I now need assistance with basic household tasks and I can't drive – so am almost entirely reliant on my wife, family and friends. 'I have completely lost my independence as I cannot bear weight on my leg. 'The holiday to the Tropicana Jasmine Hotel has become memorable for all of the wrong reasons. 'I just hope that no-one else faces what I have been through, which is why tour operators and resorts have to make sure that the safety of holidaymakers is a top priority.' Mr Robson and his wife Gillian's holiday in August 2010 was the first time the couple had been on away since their honeymoon 16 years earlier. Just one day into the holiday Mr Robson felt a pain in his right foot and noticed it was bleeding as he stepped out of the pool. He said: 'I realised I must have caught it on the lining of the pool, which was quite sharp and had what seemed to be a rough concrete surface. 'I got it bandaged up but thought it would heal fairly quickly like a standard wound. 'It stopped me from swimming for the rest of the holiday and also stopped us going on an excursion or two, but ultimately I didn't think there would be any lasting damage.' When he returned to the UK, medics at a walk-in centre told him his toe may be infected so he went to Sunderland Royal Hospital and was prescribed antibiotics. Mr Robson underwent an operation in 2012 to remove all of his toes and part of his bone from his right foot. He says this has left him unable to drive and

"Australia captain Michael Clarke bids farewell to one-day international cricket on Sunday — to save himself for one more shot at humiliating England. The 33-year-old has decided to retire from the 50-over game after steering his country to the World Cup final, with the sole intention of leading the Aussies into this summer’s Ashes showdown in England. ‘A priority for me is to continue to be successful in the Test format,’ said Clarke. ‘I think by walking away from one-day cricket it probably gives me my best opportunity.’ Michael Clarke shakes hands with New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum ahead of Sunday's final . And that spells danger for England with Clarke hungrier than ever to finally win an away Ashes series, having lost on all three of his previous trips. Clarke scored two centuries guiding Australia to their 5-0 whitewash of Alastair Cook’s dismal team last winter, but he’s desperate to break his duck in England in what will almost certainly be his last Ashes away tour. ‘I’ve never hid behind the fact that I find Test cricket to be the pinnacle of our sport,’ said Clarke, who has won 108 Test caps including 30 against England. The 33-year-old made the surprise announcement at a press conference on Saturday morning . ‘I’ve never gone down that road anyway in regard to what is the best thing to do for the public interest, as I’m sure you would have seen through my career, I’ve copped my fair share of smacks in the mouth. ‘But I am whoI am and it’s about being true to myself and I don’t feel bad about saying I believe Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. I love that challenge, I find it extremely difficult every Test match I play. I do see it as the pinnacle. I still think I’ve got a lot to offer the team as captain of the Australian Test team, and I want to make sure I continue to have success in that format.’ Clarke was made captain in all formats when Ricky Ponting stood down following the 2011 World Cup. He will be making his 245th one-day appearance for Australia and his 75th as skipper on Sunday as Australia take on New Zealand, led by Brendon McCullum (inset). George Bailey and Steve Smith are thought to be the two men most likely to succeed Clarke in captaining the Aussies.

"Scottish Labour MPs are defying Ed Miliband by telling voters on the doorstep they would not support a post-election deal with the SNP. In an indication of a growing split in the party over its election strategy, several MPs are indicating that they would not be prepared to back any arrangement with Scottish Nationalists after May. Some are even said to be threatening to quit the party rather than be part of an administration propped up by the SNP, which wants to break up the UK. Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing a rebellion in Scotland over his plan to do a post-election deal with the SNP . Despite pressure from shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, Mr Miliband has repeatedly refused to rule out relying on the votes of SNP MPs to enable a Labour government to take power if he fails to win a Commons majority. There is rising Labour panic at polls suggesting the Scottish Nationalists are heading for a landslide victory north of the border – picking up dozens of MPs at the expense of Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The latest suggest that the SNP could win as many as 50 of Scotland’s 59 seats, including Labour strongholds currently held by Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling. That would mean Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond holding the balance of power at Westminster, threatening a constitutional crisis. One Scottish Labour MP said: ‘Labour MPs on the doorstep are saying “if you vote for us we won’t do a deal with the SNP”. The group are united. I’m not aware of a colleague who is advocating against that position.’ Another MP said: ‘There’s no prospect of any deal with the SNP and I’m making that clear on the doorstep. ‘But I don’t want to be focusing on the issue of deals, and I understand why it hasn’t been ruled out [by Mr Miliband]. We would end up getting diverted into a campaign that’s all about deals, rather than our key message which is that we can have a Labour majority government.’ In constituencies where there was a strong No vote in last year’s independence referendum, or where there are large numbers of middle-class Scots who traditionally vote Lib Dem or Tory, Labour’s candidates are now telling people on the doorstep there will be no pact with the SNP. The move – in defiance of Mr Miliband’s official stance - is designed to encourage tactical voting towards Labour. But in more working-class areas such as the west of Scotland where the independence campaign performed better, MPs fear ruling out a deal could make voters leaning towards the Nationalists ‘more bloody-minded’.

"Aubrey de Grey (pictured) says ageing is a 'disease that can and should be cured' With his Rasputin beard and lines etched deep into his forehead, Aubrey de Grey looks like a man a lot older than his 51 years. A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing. But you would be wrong. For de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age. It sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet. PayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth £1.5 billion) donated £2.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing. While many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing. Google's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.' One source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.' De Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him £11 million when she died in 2011 – £9 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow. Scroll down for video . 'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, ""We were with you all along"".' De Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car – 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'. His argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body

"Royal Mail has been accused by MPs of using its universal service commitment as an excuse to raise stamp prices. First and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues. An influential committee of MPs said that if Royal Mail wanted to increase profits, it must invest in new technology and focus on efficiency, rather than simply increase prices. First and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee, said he was ‘not very pleased’ to hear they had taken the ‘easy option’ of raising stamp prices. Citizens Advice Bureau also urged Royal Mail to ‘focus on making efficiency savings rather than relying upon raising prices’ and expressed concern that consumers were held to ransom because they ‘have no choice but to pay the increased prices’. The cost of posting a large letter weighing up to 100g first class will rise by 2p to 95p. Royal Mail has warned it faces aggressive competition in the parcels market from delivery firm Whistl and called for regulators to rein in its rivals. The company says it is at a disadvantage to competitors because it must fulfil a 175-year-old ‘universal service’ obligation to deliver to all UK addresses for the same price. It said this obligation, which requires it to deliver six days a week to even the most rural communities, could soon become ‘financially unsustainable’ if Ofcom does not impose restrictions on its rivals. But the Business Committee will say today that there is no ‘immediate risk’ to the service and that, far from being a ‘burden’, the service brings ‘revenue and status’ to Royal Mail. A new report says: ‘Royal Mail should not increase postal and packaging prices simply in an attempt either to increase its own profit levels or to protect the Universal Service Obligation, without increasing the efficiency of its operations. ‘While we accept that Royal Mail has done much to improve efficiency, it still has to match the technical innovations introduced by many competitors — innovations that more clearly match the expectations of consumers.’ Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee, said he was ‘not very pleased’ to hear they had taken the ‘easy option’ of raising stamp prices . John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the rise in stamp prices would be unwelcome for many companies. He said: ‘While prices have only gone up by a penny, this still represents an above inflation rise. ‘Businesses affected will still have to decide whether to absorb this rise or pass it on to their customers.’ They said they expected Royal mail to use the additional money raised ‘to invest in improving their performance and meet delivery targets’. Mr Allan added: ‘Ofcom should carefully monitor how Royal Mail is doing, and use their powers to fine should customers’

"Nigel Farage this morning rejected claims he has been ‘sent by God’ to save Britain from the European Union – insisting: ‘I’m not the Messiah, I’m a very naughty boy.’ The Ukip leader’s remarks, echoing one of the most famous lines from Monty Python's Life of Brian, came after he was played a clip of a documentary aired this week featuring one of his more obsessive fans. Former nurse Jill said Mr Farage ‘probably didn’t realise it’ but had been ‘sent to protect us against the EU’. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage this morning insisted he was not the 'Messiah', adding: 'I'm a very naughty boy' The 59-year old dominatrix, from Poole in Dorset, told the Channel 5 documentary ‘Farage Fans and Ukip Lovers’ that Brussels wanted to install microchips in everyone – and would send people to the guillotine if they refused. She said Mr Farage, 50, was Britain’s only hope. 'God says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood, I'll send someone to give you some protection.' Jill added: 'I think Nigel Farage is sent to protect us against the EU, he wants to bring England back to the English people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders.' 'What Nigel Farage will do by getting us out of the EU is to stop their plans to microchip our people. 'The EU already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in China, equipped with guillotines. 'They will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed. So off with your head and that's when things start getting unpleasant.' Played the clip on LBC this morning Mr Farage insisted he was not placed on Earth to save Britain from Brussels. In Monty Python's Life of Brian, the hapless Brian, played by Graham Chapman (right), is hailed the Messiah - but his mother, played by Terry Jones (left) tells his followers: 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy' The cult 1979 film follows the rise of Brian Cohen, who was born on the same day as Jesus and is mistaken as the Messiah . He said: ‘Jill, I’m sure, is an absolutely delightful woman, but I have to disappoint her. Jill, I’m not the Messiah, I’m a very naughty boy.’ Jill - who says she once saw an angel in Tesco Express - doesn't just think Farage will save the nation with his foreign policies. She also believes UKIP is helping Brits become more liberated in the bedroom. She's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many UKIP supporters who share her fondness for S&M. She said: 'I would love a cabinet position as head of bondage. It's my hobby and I do enjoy it, it's all role-play and froth, it's a natural English phenomenon to like it. 'Sometimes I like to be submissive and other times dominant. I have met a lot of UKIP supporters who are into BDSM. They do seem to have a natural bent

"A beautiful snowy owl has been captured scouring a snow-covered field in the hunt for food. Her piercing yellow eyes were the only thing that stood out against the white landscape in Ottawa, Canada. Once locked on to a vole she swooped just inches above the surface waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. The stunning set of images was captured by photographer Rick Dobson. A beautiful snowy owl was captured gliding inches above a snow-covered field in Ottawa, Canada, in the hunt for food, with her bright yellow eyes just visible above the wing . The 57-year-old said: 'She had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill. 'Snowy owls are diurnal so they hunt and are active both during the day and night. 'When they are resting they often sit in a snow-covered field motionless, making themselves very hard to spot. 'When they are hunting they will perch on a lump in a field, a fence post, or a hydro-pole where they have a lookout from which to spot their prey.' As the owl came over the top of a ledge she pulled her wings back so she could soar across the field . The stunning set of images was captured by photographer Rick Dobson who said: 'She had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill' The owl flew silently just millimetres above the snow-covered floor, keeping her bright eyes on the prey . To get close enough to the owls, Mr Dobson had to make sure he approached slowly and did not walk directly towards the birds. He said: 'Every winter I go out with my binoculars and scan the farmers' fields to see if I can locate wintering snowy owls. 'When I locate an owl I have to spend time slowly approaching it to get within a good distance to take photographs. When the owl got close enough she used her sharp talons to catch her prey. Snowy owls will usually fly a short distance before landing to eat . Snowy owls often approach their prey from a low angle to ensure a shadow does not give the game away . 'Some owls are much more approachable than others. 'Upon repeated visits the owls come to realise that I am not a threat and will ignore me, providing I move slowly, and carry on with its business.' Mr Dobson described the owls as 'one of the most magnificent creatures on earth'. 'I think of them as snow ghosts or snow angels,' he said. 'They are very large birds but fly silently and gracefully and can endure the harshest of habitats. Happy with its work: Mr Dobson added: 'Snowy owls are one of the most magnificent creatures on earth'. The beautiful bird is pictured after the hunt .

Zallu Hassan suffered severe facial injuries including a broken cheekbone and jaw and a fractured eye socket after the gang stormed her home in Ilford, Essex. Her devastated daughter, Tulay Ahmadi, 46, believes the intruders kicked her mother's head and stamped on her face during the attack overnight on March 9. Mrs Ahmadi, who raised the alarm after arriving at her mother's house and finding her in a pool of blood, is now offering a £10,000 reward for anyone who has information leading to the arrest of the offenders.

Mrs Ahmadi said the family are now trying to establish what was stolen as the house was ransacked but her mother has 'nothing of real value' and nothing obvious is missing. She said: 'They're just animals - any human being who has any kind of respect would not do this. 'If I could I would inflict the same pain onto them 10 times over. It's just horrific.

Mrs Ahmadi said: 'My mum was very mobile but I feel this has definitely advanced her Alzheimer's - she's become very reclusive since she was attacked.

"Scientists are virtually certain that California will be rocked by a strong earthquake in the next 30 years. Now they say the risk of a mega-quake is more likely than previously thought. The chance of a magnitude-8 quake striking the state in the next three decades jumped to 7 per cent from 4.7 per cent, mainly because scientists took into account the possibility that several faults can shake at once, releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction. While the risk of a mega-quake is higher than past estimates, it's more likely - greater than 99 per cent chance - that California will be rattled by a magnitude-6.7 jolt similar in size to the 1994 Northridge disaster. Brace: A new U.S. Geological Survey report has increased the likelihood of a magnitude-8 earthquake hitting California over the next 30 years. Above, a photo of an overpass that collapsed in the 1994 magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake . The chance of a Northridge-size quake was slightly higher in Northern California than Southern California - 95 per cent versus 93 per cent, according to a report released Tuesday by the U.S. Geological Survey. 'California is earthquake country, and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one,' USGS geophysicist and lead author Ned Field said. The latest seismic calculations largely mirror previous findings issued by the USGS in 2008. Back then, scientists also determined that California faced an almost certain risk of experiencing a Northridge-size quake. The new report included newly discovered fault zones and the possibility that a quake can jump from fault to fault. Because of this knowledge, the odds of a catastrophic quake - magnitude 8 or larger - in the next 30 years increased. There is a 93 per cent chance of a magnitude 7 or larger occurring over the same period and a 48 per cent chance of a magnitude 7.5 - similar to previous estimates. Thousands of quakes every year hit California, sandwiched between two of Earth's major tectonic plates, the Pacific and North American plates. Most are too small to be felt. Of the more than 300 faults that crisscross the state, the southern segment of the San Andreas Fault - which runs from central California to the Salton Sea near the U.S.-Mexico border - remains the greatest threat because it hasn't ruptured in more than three centuries. The report found there is a 19 per cent chance in the next 30 years that a Northridge-size quake will unzip the southern section compared to a 6.4 per cent chance for the northern section, partly because it last broke in 1906. The southern San Andreas is 'ready to have an earthquake because it's really locked and loaded,' Field said. The report is a forecast, but it is not a prediction. Experts still cannot predict exactly where or when a quake will hit anywhere in the world. In recent years, the USGS and several universities have been testing an early warning system designed to detect the first waves of a jolt and send out an alert

A ball of lightning then appeared outside the cockpit and a lightning bolt struck the Saab 2000 plane’s nose, and then travelled the full length of the aircraft before leaving its tail. The aircraft landed safely in Aberdeen with only minor damage and no injuries. An AAIB probe discovered that the autopilot on the Loganair Saab 2000 G-LGNO had remained engaged and the pilot’s actions were countered by the system, causing the dive.

Shaneah did not speak before the court but placed a comforting hand on Ms Ward when she spoke to media outside.

"A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h). The Maglev train completed a test run on a track in Yamanashi, beating the previous record of 361mph (580km/h) set in 2003. Another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow, and engineers at the Central Japan Railway Company predict it could reach 373mph (600km/h). Scroll down for video . A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h) Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. The seven-car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h), which will cut the journey time for a 178-mile journey by more than half. For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h). The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time. Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964 . It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr). It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027 . China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (£830million) to build. Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe. Andy Kunz, president

'That wasn't a good idea to say that. 40 million, he should take it,' 50 Cent told TMZ. Broner had told TMS Sports he didn't appreciate receiving the offer via email: 'The capacity of the contract was $40 million for five years, that's just bull****… Like I wanted to tell him, and hopefully this get to him, stop sending your workers to come talk to me.

"Marouane Fellaini struck twice as Belgium moved within three points of Euro 2016 Group B qualifying leaders Wales with a 5-0 thumping of Cyprus on Saturday. After a win and two draws from their first three matches, Belgium knew the pressure was on to produce a performance befitting a side ranked fourth in the world. 'The players enjoyed themselves and knew what to do. Yes, I'm satisfied,' Belgian coach Marc Wilmots told reporters. Marouane Fellaini celebrates after scoring for Belgium in their European qualifier against Cyprus . Christian Benteke (right) is congratulated after scoring the second goal in Belgium's win over Cyprus .

The hosts, who reached the quarter-finals of last year's World Cup, were 2-0 up at halftime although they could easily have been four or five ahead against a packed but often porous Cypriot defence. Manchester United midfielder Fellaini opened Belgium's account midway through the first half after the visitors failed to clear a corner. A cross by Eden Hazard then set up Christian Benteke to make it 2-0 in the 35th minute. Fellaini found the top corner with a perfectly placed long-range strike in the 66th minute but that effort was matched a minute later by Hazard. With two defenders in front of him, the Chelsea playmaker shifted cleverly to the right before curling the ball into the net off the inside of the far post. Debutant Michy Batshuayi completed the demolition in the 80th minute after the hard-working Radja Nainggolan dispossessed a defender. Fellaini is congratulated by his Belgium team-mates after scoring the opening goal of the night . Vincent Kompany (left) and Fellaini celebrate after the latter got the ball rolling against Cyprus on Saturday . Cyprus, who beat Bosnia 2-1 in September, were without six injured players and barely mounted an attack with a single off-target header in the second half proving their only threat. 'We lost to the better team. Belgium is one of the best in the world,' said Cyprus coach Charalambos Christodoulou. 'We have to forget this game. We knew from the start it would be difficult to get something away against Belgium. Aston Villa man Benteke (right) celebrates with team-mate Radja Nainggolan at the King Baudouin stadium .

"When 16-year-old Billy Flynn gunned down the husband of his high school instructor and lover, Pamela Smart, in 1990, the trial became an instant tabloid sensation. Its lurid details aired gavel-to-gavel on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle and spawned movies and books. Twenty-five years after Gregg Smart's killing, Pamela Smart remains in prison serving life without the possibility of parole and Flynn makes his first bid for parole Thursday, his 41st birthday. Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Smart's 1991 trial that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus credit for pretrial incarceration. Here's a look at some key details in the case: . Teacher: Pamela Smart (seen in this 1991 file photo) was convicted of conspiring with her 15 year-old lover, William 'Billy' Flynn, to kill her 24 year-old husband, Greggory Smart. Smart is serving a life without parole sentence . Student: In this 1991 file photo, William Flynn testifies on his 17th birthday how he shot Greggory Smart in the head and killed him. Flynn pleaded guilty to killing Smart and has a parole hearing scheduled for Thursday . The plot . According to trial testimony, Smart was 22 and one of Flynn's instructors in a self-awareness program at Winnicunnet High School in Hampton when she seduced the 15-year-old Flynn. She told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything, including her dog and furniture, if she divorced Gregg Smart as their wedding anniversary approached. Flynn said he and three cohorts bungled an attempt to kill Smart in April, when they got lost on the way there. But on May 1, 1990, he and 18-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. To this day, Pamela Smart denies knowing about the plot. But the state's star witness, a teenage intern in whom Smart confided, secretly recorded her after the killing saying, 'If you tell the (expletive) truth, you'll send me to the slammer for the rest of my (expletive) life.' Smart was convicted March 22, 1991, of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy and witness tampering. Randall got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released. Life in prison: Flynn (seen in January 2008) married while behind bars, has a teen stepdaughter and has earned his GED and electrician's helper license . Media circus: The trials's lurid details aired gavel-to-gavel on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle and spawned movies and books . Sensational trial . Smart's trial was the first in the country to be televised nationally from start to finish, her trial lawyer, Mark Sisti, said ruefully. 'Her trial turned into the ultimate daytime TV drama, and the witnesses were dressing up for it and performing rather than testifying,'

"Brandon Marshall is to be traded for the third time in his NFL career and will join the New York Jets after three years with the Chicago Bears. The prodigiously talented wide receiver turns 31 this month, but the move had been widely touted. Deemed an outspoken maverick by many at Soldier Field, he raised eyebrows with a post-game locker room rant after defeat to the Miami Dolphins in October. His appearances as an analyst on 'Inside the NFL' weekly were also said to be a distraction. Brandon Marshall will head to New York on Tuesday for a medical ahead of his move to the Jets . The mercurial Marshall is yet to play in the play-offs . New head coach John Fox and offensive co-ordinator Adam Gase appeared lukewarm about Marshall at best. 'We’re trying to evaluate where everybody fits and how we best use them and, again, trying to put the best football team on the field. He’s part of that process,' Fox told the Chicago Tribune last month. Marshall was close to Jay Cutler - following him to Chicago from Denver via Miami - but raw quarterback Geno Smith could test his short fuse. ESPN broke news of the trade, which will also see the Jets give the Bears a fifth round draft pick. Marshall signed a four-year deal in Chicago last May, and had seven consecutive 1,000 yard seasons before falling short last year - largely due to missing the final three games with a shoulder complaint. Despite the numbers, Marshall is yet to appear in a play-off game. Perhaps that will change in New York. New head coach Todd Bowles was with Marshall during his two-year stint in Miami and will have been influential in the trade. The move will likely mean the end of Percy Harvin's short stint with the Gang Green, with Marshall to pair up with Eric Decker. Marshall was drafted in the fourth round of the 2006 draft by the Broncos and is a mental health spokesman, spreading awareness of his battle with Borderline Personality Disorder.

But the 92-year-old's family was under the impression she planned to sell the house and allowed charity Age UK to clear it out. Her beloved dog Mitzy was also taken to a local animal sanctuary and later re-homed. After returning to find the house empty, the great-grandmother has criticised the charity and her family. Scroll down for video . Pamela Clothier had to retrieve her possessions after she returned from hospital to find her house cleared . The 92-year-old says the worst thing was losing her dog, Mitzy, who was given to a local animal sanctuary . Mrs Clothier said: 'My son Peter didn't think I was going to make it, so he just upped and tried to sell everything. I can't believe he could be so cruel.' She added: 'They left me with nothing. All my furniture was gone, all my diaries, books, clothes, everything. The worst thing is that I can't get my dog back either.' She spoke about the incident after Age UK offered her an 'insulting' £1,000 compensation. She said: 'They did get me some of my furniture back, and I have been able to get more things from my friends, but I still feel like it's not my home any more. 'In my day I would have knocked the spots off anybody, but now I'm absolutely demolished.' Mrs Clothier has lived alone since her Bomber Command hero husband Clyde passed away in 1991. The fiercely independent nonagenarian added: 'I loved my home - it had masses of memories. I've got nothing now, not even my dog. 'Peter made up his mind that selling my property was the thing to do, and he got rid of the furniture that was clogging up the place. I was left effectively having to start my life over again.' Pamela Clothier says she was horrified when a charity cleared out her belongings without her permission .

"A white supremacist who has been charged with three murders entered a plea of not guilty in court on Friday. Frazier Glenn Miller, 74, is charged with capital murder in the April 13, 2014, shootings at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas, and at the nearby Village Shalom Retirement Center. Miller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, is a Vietnam War veteran from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party. None of the victims of the 2014 shooting that took place on the eve of Passover, a week-long holiday in which the Jewish community celebrates their freedom from slavery in Egypt, were Jewish. Scroll down for video . Frazier Glenn Miller (above) entered a plea of not guilty for charges of capital murder in the killing of three individuals on April 13, 2014 . Miller, a supremacist, allegedly opened fire outside a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas screaming 'Heil Hitler!' Miller (mugsghot above), who says he is ill and does not have much time to live, also asked for a speedy trial . On Friday, Frazier also asked for a speedy trial and to have Internet access while he is in prison. The judge granted him the right to a speedy trial, which will begin August 17, but denied him Internet access. Miller said he would go to trial in 30 days if he could represent himself. Overland Park police Sgt. Marty C. Ingram testified earlier this month at a preliminary hearing that he heard shots fired at the Jewish Community Center and saw the doors of the center's theater shatter. He said he took cover as more shots hit the building's facade back on April 13. 'Dust, smoke was flying everywhere at that point,' he said. The gunman then drove away. When he heard that fellow officers had arrested a suspect, Ingram accompanied some witnesses to the arrest scene to determine if they could identify him. As they approached the patrol car where Miller was detained, he shouted 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed. Miller is accused of killing Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were attending a singing contest audition at the community center. He also is accused of killing 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the nearby Jewish retirement home. Miller (above in 80s) was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car . At a December hearing, Miller, who has emphysema, said he was afraid that he doesn't have much time left to live following a trip to the emergency room in March. Miller previously served three years in federal prison on weapons charges and for planning the killing of the Southern Poverty Law Center's founder.

"Samantha Cameron is to hit the campaign trail as part of a Tory strategy to keep her husband in Number 10. Conservative strategists believe the PM's wife could be a secret weapon in the battle for re-election on May 7. The couple appeared together yesterday in the first of many campaign visits, but David Cameron admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold. Scroll down for video . David and Samantha Cameron are to appear together regularly during the election campaign to woo floating voters . Mrs Cameron has secured a broadly positive press since moving into Number 10 five years ago, largely by keeping below the radar. Many of her appearances have been linked to her charities, including Save The Children, Comic Relief and Tickets For Troops. She has also championed the creative industries, hosting events in Downing Street to mark London Fashion Week. But she is now expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last week to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister. She said: 'He's definitely for my mind the best man for the job. 'I hope that me and the family help him to keep things in perspective - keep him grounded - help him to pace himself over the next eight weeks.' And yesterday they were filmed together discussing their hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009. The couple appeared at Salford Royal Hospital on Saturday, where they spoke to patient Tom Lawrence about their hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009 . Mrs Cameron was on the front row for her husbands keynote speech to the Conservative Spring Forum . Mrs Cameron managed to avoid being caught pulling an embarrassing expression, something her husband did not acheive . They were seen speaking to a patient during a visit to Salford's Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. The PM said: 'When our son was very ill, we often went into hospital and it is very difficult to get out at the weekend.' Mrs Cameron added: 'On a Friday, if we thought there was any chance that we could get home, I was like: 'We've got to get out this afternoon'.' The Tory leader has made much of his regular 'date nights', slipping out of Downing Street to visit trendy restaurants like Kitty Fisher's in Mayfair and the celeb haunt Chiltern Firehouse. But the nights out will have to be shelved while the couple focus on winning votes. Mrs Cameron used an appearance in a BBC interview at the couple's Oxfordshire home last week to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister .

"(CNN)Five full weeks into Aaron Hernandez's murder trial, prosecutors have called 77 witnesses. Jurors have yet to hear from the former NFL star's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick or owner Robert Kraft. But this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd in 2013. Check out some of the key moments you might have missed this week. A DNA analyst from the Massachusetts State Police crime lab said she found that Hernandez's DNA matched the DNA taken from a marijuana joint found near Lloyd's body at the crime scene. Lloyd's DNA also was found on the blunt. The DNA analyst, Diane Biagiotti, testified to finding a partial DNA match from Hernandez on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the Enterprise rental car office. But under cross-examination, lead defense attorney Jamie Sultan got Biagiotti to acknowledge there's a high likelihood that DNA from chewing gum could have transferred to the shell casing found in the dumpster. The office manager at the rental car office, Keelia Smyth, testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the Nissan Altima returned by Hernandez on June 17, 2013. She said she threw them in the trash bin outside of her office. Inside Hernandez's downward spiral . It was revealed by Sultan that the state never submitted the gum for DNA testing. The state has not yet explained why. We may hear the answer during the state's redirect of Biagiotti on Monday. Hernandez is seen on surveillance video buying gum, and he also offered some to Smyth. Biagiotti said under cross-examination that it's highly unlikely to find DNA on any shell casing. One reason is because the heat from the gun wipes away any DNA, she said. The shell casings found at the crime scene did not have enough DNA on them to produce a DNA profile. Hernandez's family was in court on Friday after a week's absence. Hernandez's mother, Terri Hernandez, told CNN' that she thought Friday ""went very well"" for him. Testimony this week also focused on fingerprints from Hernandez and Lloyd that were found inside the rented Nissan Altima. The car also had fingerprints of Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are also charged with killing Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. State Trooper David Mackin, a fingerprint expert with the Massachusetts State Police crime scene services, reported finding the fingerprints of Wallace and Ortiz in a Chrysler 300 that Hernandez rented. Prosecutors call it the ""getaway car,"" which was ultimately found abandoned in Bristol, Connecticut. But no prints were found on the .22-caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near Hernandez's home. Hernandez is charged with illegal possession of that gun. In addition, no prints were found on any of the shell casings, including the casing found stuck to the blue bubblegum in the dumpster outside the Enterprise office. Another key find: tire treads of the rear

"Prison officer Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, was arrested on Thursday. He and fellow Klan members planned to kill a black inmate after his release in retaliation for a fight, officials said . Three Florida prison officers who belong to the Ku Klux Klan have been charged with plotting to kill a black inmate after his release, officials said on Thursday. The KKK men believed the prisoner was infected with HIV and hepatitis and he bit one of them during a fight, officials said. Klans men Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, David Elliot Moran, 47, and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42, each face one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, according to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office. The supposed hit man was an FBI criminal informant who recorded those scenes and others over the past year. Investigators said he faked pictures of the black man's death to help build a case against three Klan members who worked at a Florida prison. The case is the latest black eye for the troubled state prison system. The state said the murder plot started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center in Gainesville, rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmate. Moran is currently a sergeant there. Newcomb was fired in 2013 for failing to meet training requirements, according to the department. Bondi's office said the three were also members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The group has garnered attention in recent months for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. The FBI was alerted to the murder plot by a confidential informant inside the Klan, according to an arrest affidavit. Scroll down for video . David Moran, a prison employee (pictured left), who together with another employee of the Florida Dept. of Corrections and former employee Charles Thomas Newcomb (right) were arrested for plotting to kill a black inmate who had allegedly bitten one guard during a fight . The informant was present when Driver and Moran talked with Newcomb, identified as the KKK chapter's 'Exalted Cyclops' or leader, and recorded many of their conversations. In late 2014, authorities say Driver gave the Klan chapter, called a klavern, a photograph of the inmate, who'd been let out on supervised release. 'Both Driver and Moran ... told the (confidential informant) that they wanted (the inmate) 'six feet under',' the FBI's affidavit said. The informant recorded all three men making plans to murder the inmate, according to the affidavit. In the recordings, the men often refer to the inmate using a racial epithet. Their first attempt to find and kill the inmate failed and the informant recorded a conversation with Driver to confirm he still wanted him dead, the affidavit said. 'Do you want this guy terminated?' the informant asked. 'Yes sir,' Driver replied, according to the affidavit. The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has garnered attention for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists.

"A computer programmer who killed his girlfriend and then almost got away with it after staging a cover-up has been jailed for five years. Edward Metcalfe claimed that the death of Tracey Topliss, 47, had been a tragic accident after she fell down the stairs at their home in Hall Green, Birmingham. A post-mortem also ruled that her death had been an accident, but after a friend of the victim told police of domestic violence within the relationship, police re-investigated the case and charged Metcalfe with murder. Edward Metcalfe, right, who has been jailed for five years following the death of his partner Tracey Topliss, left. Her death had initially been ruled as an accident . Today following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, he was acquitted of murder but convicted of the manslaughter of his partner of 13 years and jailed. The court heard how Miss Topliss, a National Grid worker, was killed on November 15 in 2013 at the couple's home. Both she and Metcalfe, 36, had been drinking after she received the news that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer. Hugh O'Brien Quinn, prosecuting, said that following an initial post-mortem, it had been concluded that Miss Topliss's death had been accidental. The judge told Metcalfe, pictured, that his behaviour had been 'utterly selfish' and that he showed a 'complete lack of remorse' However, he added: 'That was until Mrs Sharon Wade contacted the police and told them of her concerns. 'She had been a good friend of Tracey Topliss. It was to her that Miss Topliss had complained about domestic violence from her partner.' It was then that a second post-mortem was conducted and the court heard how the pathologist discovered an injury to the victim's cheek, consistent with a heavy punch. Judge Paul Farrer QC said that Miss Topliss was a 'hard-working, successful and well-respected by her professional colleagues.' Addressing Metcalfe, he added: 'There must have been some disagreement between you which caused you to lose your temper. 'You delivered a significant punch to the right side of her face. The blow caused her to fall backwards and strike her head against a table. 'You thought of nobody but yourself. Rather than trying to help her or call the emergency services, you left her lying on the floor of the hallway. 'You waited approximately for two-and-a-half hours before dialling 999. 'Your behaviour was utterly selfish and betrayed a complete lack of remorse. You showed a callous disregard for your victim.' However, David Crigman QC, defending said: 'What he has been found guilty of is one punch with disastrous consequences. 'It must have happened within seconds. There was no evidence of a protracted argument. But for her falling backwards and hitting her head, the deceased would not have suffered a serious injury.' Metcalfe was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter and jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court . Metcalfe was then jailed for five years and after the hearing, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Edward Metcalfe initially deceived the authorities into

It is the brainchild of drinks giant Diageo and ThinFilm Electronics, which develops printed electronics. The bottle has sensor tags using ThinFilm's OpenSense technology on its labels that allow the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky, or afterwards. It uses a smartphone’s near field communication (NFC) capabilities so that a handset can be hovered over the label to unlock its digital secrets. The bottle has sensor tags using ThinFilm's OpenSense technology on its label that allows the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky, or afterwards. It also tells a user that the bottle was properly sealed and when it is open (illustrated by the prototype) Scanning the label could, for example, give consumers special offers, cocktail recipes or film content. The technology could also be useful for the London-based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes. The sensor tags will remain readable after the factory seal has been broken so that they provide ‘an additional layer of security in protecting the authenticity of the product,’ Diageo says. This is because unlike static QR codes, which are easy to copy and don’t include sensors, the new labels will be permanently encoded in the factory do they can’t be copied or electronically modified.

"A woman accusing NFL player Warren Sapp of assault in his hotel room the night after the Super Bowl has denied prostitution. Britney Osbourne, 23, claims the former defensive tackle picked her up at a bar, demanded a strip tease by throwing money at her in his hotel room, then pushed her to the ground when she protested. Pleading not guilty to prostitution, she denies Sapp's claim that she was paid $300 for her to perform sex acts on him on February 2 in the Renaissance Hotel of Phoenix, Arizona, TMZ reported. If guilty Osbourne, who has previously been arrested for prostitution, faces time in jail. Scroll down for video . Denial: Britney Osbourne, 23, denies prostitution and claims she was assaulted by Warren Sapp last month . Former NFL player Sapp (left) also claims he paid Quying Boyd (right) $300 to perform sex acts on him in his hotel room after the Super Bowl on February 2. Boyd has pleaded not guilty to escorting without a license . The other woman detained in connection with the incident is 34-year-old Quying Boyd, who has been charged with not having a license to escort. Boyd, who has also pleaded not guilty according to TMZ, was arrested in 2014 in Manhattan for allegedly luring rich male clients to steal thousands of dollars at a time. She was released without charge. She denies performing sex acts on Sapp for money. Sapp, 42, attempted to strengthen his story by showing police officers video of the women performing sex acts on him, the New York Post reported last month. He is charged with assault and soliciting prostitution, for which he faces six months in jail. Sapp said that one of the women demanded more money and both women started screaming at him when he said no. 'He told her several times that she needed to leave, but she was irate,' says a police report. Career: Sapp played 13 NFL seasons, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers then with the Oakland Raiders . The incident allegedly took place in the early hours of February 2 at Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix . 'At one point, she used Warren’s phone to call security to his room.' During the argument Sapp allegedly tossed one of the woman out of his room, knocking the other woman down. Sapp was fired by the NFL Network after the story broke last month. Sapp, a member of the Football Hall of Fame, was in town covering the big game for NFL Network. Sapp's biography has since been pulled from NFL Network's On-Air Talent list on its website. The football analyst was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution and assault. He has since been released from custody without bail after a judge ruled that he was not a flight risk. According to reporting by AZ Central, police were called to Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix at around 2.30am Monday after the incident in response to a noise complaint.

"QPR director of football Les Ferdinand has called for a Rooney Rule-style law to be introduced in English football to challenge what he believes is a 'lack of diversity' in the game. Football Association chairman Greg Dyke was first to suggest the adoption of the American system - which requires NFL teams to interview at least one minority candidate for each head coaching role - in 2014. And now Ferdinand has reopened the debate by insisting it could be the best way to give prospective black managers the confidence to aspire to positions they currently feel are beyond them. QPR director of football Les Ferdinand would like to see the introduction of a Rooney Rule-style law . The QPR director of football believes there is a lack of diversity in English football . Ferdinand told Sky Sports: 'We're not saying you have to give anybody the job - we're just saying ""give us an interview"" - that's all. 'It's just a case of being able to sit down and put your credentials on the table. At the moment we're not even getting that chance. 'People often talk and say ""I'm not racist"" and don't even realise that they are being racist because they won't give you that opportunity. 'You may have already decided who your next manager is going to be but if I sit down in front of you I might impress you so much that you might recommend me to someone else.' FA chairman Greg Dyke was first to suggest the adoption of the American system in 2014 . Ferdinand wants black managers to be given the opportunity to showcase their credentials at interviews . Dyke's support for the Rooney Rule was not shared by others in the game with Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore rejecting the idea. But Ferdinand's views are shared by anti-racist campaigners Kick It Out, which told Sky Sports News: 'The access to opportunities for employment in football continue to be out of reach for many. The recruitment procedures are flawed, and there is a lack of accountability and transparency in the processes. 'We need to see a level playing field established where individuals possessing the necessary qualifications and experience are able to apply and be taken into proper consideration for positions. 'As it stands, many credible candidates who are suitable for jobs do not feel it is worthwhile applying as they see a closed culture which exists preventing them from having a fair chance.' The League Managers Association supports the implementation of a Rooney Rule-style law, and a spokesman said: 'The LMA is committed to the fundamental principle of equal opportunities for anyone, from any background, who wishes to work and build a career, as a manager or coach, in professional football and we are focussed on the need to increase the number of managers from black and ethnic minorities who have coaching or management qualifications.'

"The wife of a passenger on missing the MH370 flight plane has spoken of her heartache, revealing she is still desperate for answers a year after the airliner vanished. It has been 12 months to the day since Perth father Paul Weeks boarded the Beijing-bound flight in Kuala Lumpur and his wife Danica Weeks is still at a loss about what to tell her young boys - and where their beloved father has gone. Ms Weeks said despite being advised by people that she needs to tell Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2, what happened to him, she refuses to lie to their sons and will wait until the truth is discovered. Scroll down for video . Danica Weeks doesn't know what to say to her sons Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2 about where their daddy has gone . Paul Weeks boarded the MH370 flight a year ago . 'People say you've got to tell them the truth and I say ""do you?"" because I don't and I'm not going to put them through what I think it is then it turns out to be something completely different – and I will choose to tell them,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald. Ms Weeks described the past year as 'surreal' and a 'blur' without being able to see, or even say farewell, to her 'best friend'. 'I'm just this housewife wanting her amazing husband. He did so much for us as a family and he would do exactly the same if he was in my shoes – he would want to bring us home – and I'll do it for him, he deserves it,' she said. Her mining engineer husband, who was on his way to start a new job in Mongolia when the plane inexplicably vanished, gave her his wedding ring when they said their goodbyes at the airport on Marhc 8, 2014. Ms Weeks said she could not have survived the trauma of the past 12 months if it wasn't for the support of the Western Australian community. She added that it has been impossible to begin the mourning process and even think about moving on. 'Even for the children, we haven't even had a memorial or had a chance to say our goodbyes,' she said. '[Since MH370] There have been two plane crashes and they get the bodies home – we don't even get a piece of the plane.' This comes as China's Foreign minister vowed to never give up looking for the plane while Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the search can't go on forever. Other officials said discussions were already under way between countries involved in the search as to whether to call off the hunt in coming weeks.

"(CNN)A court in Turkey this week sentenced two cartoonists to 11 months and 20 days in prison for insulting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Soon after, the court changed the jail sentence to a fine of 7,000 Turkish lira or about $2,700 each. Cartoonists Bahadir Baruter and Ozer Aydogan draw for the weekly satirical magazine Penguen. Founded in 2002 with a weekly average of 65,000 readers, the irreverent comic book -- similar in many ways to the French magazine Charlie Hebdo -- regularly skewers Turkish politicians. A defamation suit was filed against an August cover of Penguen in which a cartoon figure of Erdogan is welcomed to the presidential palace by a public servant. Erdogan tells him, ""But this is so dry. We could have at least slaughtered a journalist."" In a statement to the press, the Penguen team explained that a citizen who described himself as an Erdogan supporter ""sent an email to the Prime Ministry Information Center. ... According to the notice, the employee (in the cartoon) 'made the gay signal with his fingers.' "" Turkey's public prosecutor eventually launched an investigation, claiming that both the speech bubbles and the ""hand drawing"" insulted Erdogan. While the court ruled Wednesday in favor of Erdogan, a full-length explanation of the verdict will be released in a week to 10 days. It is so far unclear whether the judge ruled that the speech bubbles or the ""gay hand gesture"" or both were an insult. The ruling comes amid an increase in criminal cases lodged against journalists, students and public figures for ""defamation against a public officer."" In 2014, Turkey was ranked one of the world's worst jailers of journalists by the media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders and its press status ""not free"" by Freedom House. The Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Nils Muižnieks, expressed his concern about the ruling against Penguen as well as the surge in criminal cases against people accused of insulting Erdogan. ""This sentence is misguided and, along with a pattern of criminal prosecutions, sends a chilling message to media professionals and all those who want to exercise their right to free expression,"" Muižnieks said. Ann Harrison of freedom of press advocacy group PEN International told CNN, ""We have long called for decriminalization of defamation, particularly of state officials, as to criminalize criticism of authorities severely stifles reporting and public debate."" Harrison noted that special mandates from the United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Organization of American States have called for the abolishment of criminal defamation laws. Penguen announced it will appeal the decision. The magazine also defiantly released a new cartoon mocking the case. ""We will continue drawing our cartoons,"" Penguen announced in a statement. ""We hope this case will be the last example of the intimidation effort on free thought.""

"(CNN)When one man sat down next to a second man in a St. Louis light rail car and asked him his opinion on the shooting of Michael Brown, it was not the beginning of a discussion. It was the start of an assault, police said. The second man, who was white, didn't want to answer the question. Then the first man, who was black, boxed him in the face. Two more African-American men joined in the beating, according to a police report about Monday's incident. It was caught on surveillance cameras on the MetroLink train and a passenger recorded it with a cell phone and posted the video online. It has gone viral. Police confirmed to CNN that the online images came from the attack. The victim, 43, was commuting home when a young man in a red T-shirt and cap walked up to him. The victim asked not to be named in media reports. The man asked to use the victim's cell phone. He declined, and the young man sat down beside him. ""Then he asked me my opinion on the Michael Brown thing,"" the victim told KMOV, ""and I responded I was too tired to think about it right now."" The suspect, in his 20s, stood up. ""The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face,"" the victim said. The video showed the suspect unleashing a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who covered himself with his hand and forearms. The two other men, also in their 20s, joined in, police said. As the train pulled into a station, a security guard saw part of the beating and alerted police. The man in the red T-shirt could be seen on video kicking at the victim's face before the train's doors opened and the assailants ran out. The train's surveillance cameras captured clear images of their faces, which MetroLink passed on to journalists. Police are looking for the three men. They face possible charges of third-degree assault, police said. It is a misdemeanor under Missouri law. The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, police said. The first punch dug the frame of his eyeglasses into the skin of his nose, the victim said. He declined to receive medical treatment. But then there was the emotional pain. On the video, people could be heard laughing while the man was beaten. ""I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,"" the victim said. ""And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911."" Condemnation of the beating has spread across social media, including from people who protested the shooting of Brown last year by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The officer was not indicted in Brown's death. St. Louis alderman Antonio French, a vocal community leader in the aftermath of Ferguson, tweeted his disappointment in the beating. ""Mike Brown question sparks MetroLink beating caught on video,"" he wrote. ""This is disgusting. We have a major problem, STL."" CNN's John

"Sacrifice: Jogendra Sen was the only non-white man in his regiment . They were all young, proud, and ready to serve king and country. But among the eager group of young men who had signed up to fight in the First World War together, one face stood out from the rest. Jogendra Sen rushed to join the queue of recruits to the Leeds ‘Pals’ Battalion when it was raised in September 1914 – and became the only non-white member of the 15th West Yorkshire Regiment. Yet were it not for a chance discovery almost a century later, his life – and death – might have been lost to history. A pair of broken and bloodstained spectacles in an Indian museum have shed light on the sacrifice of a volunteer who battled prejudice and racism to serve the country he made his home. They were the same glasses that ‘Jon’, as he was called by his English comrades, had worn in a photograph taken at a training camp in Yorkshire. Cruelly, the Bengal-born student’s race had barred him from fulfilling his dream of being an officer in the British Army, even though he was highly educated and had earned a degree in electrical engineering from Leeds University. But it also won him a place in history. Because less than 20 months after that training camp photograph, Jogendra Sen was killed in action near the Somme on May 22, 1916. Academics believe that the 28-year-old private had become the first Bengali to die fighting for Britain in the war. Although many more would later serve on the Western Front in the Indian Army, at the beginning of the war, most Bengalis were banned from joining up in their own country because of racial prejudice. The catalyst that allowed the tale of Pte Sen’s spectacles to emerge publicly was Dr Santanu Das, a reader in English at King’s College London, who noticed them and some of his other belongings in a museum on a visit to Sen's home town of Chandernagore, some 22 miles north of Kolkata in West Bengal, India. One of the chaps: Private Sen, centre, and his comrades pose for a photograph at a training camp in 1914 . Poignant: Jogendra Sen's glasses and other belongings were discovered in a museum in India . A book of friendship quotes given to Private Jogendra Sen by 'Cis', believed to be Mary Cicely Newton . When the academic mentioned his discovery during a talk at Leeds University, a local researcher recalled seeing Sen’s name on its war memorial. From this, Leeds researchers painstakingly pieced together one man’s war. Sen had worked as an engineer while continuing with his studies. A photograph of a woman found in his personal effects, inscribed ‘Yours with love, Cis’, was found to be of Mary Cicely Newton, who had links with the Mill Hill Chapel in Leeds where, it transpired, Sen sang in the choir. But although Sen was deeply involved in his local community, he faced discrimination even as he offered his life for the war effort. In

"Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’

"Ashley Barnes says that he has laughed off allegations from Jose Mourinho that he was guilty of a 'criminal tackle' on Nemanja Matic when Burnley drew at Chelsea last month. Barnes' challenge was branded 'criminal' by Mourinho and Matic's retaliation saw him receive a red card during last month's 1-1 draw while the Burnley player was unpunished. It thrust Barnes and his club into the national spotlight and speaking about the incident for the first time to Burnley's programme for their match against Manchester City on Saturday, the 25-year-old striker explained how he dealt with the furore. Burnley forward Ashley Barnes attempts a shot as his side beat Manchester City 1-0 on Saturday evening . This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Nemanja Matic at Stamford Bridge last month . Barnes closes down Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko during the Premier League clash on Saturday . The Burnley striker said: 'You're always going to get people who come out of the woodwork and voice their opinion. There were lots of comments made that it was a 'criminal tackle' and that it was disgusting but you just have to laugh it off really. 'Obviously I've not meant it. I give my all for the team but I'm an honest player. As I've gone to pass the ball he's come to try and screen in front of the strikers. I've took a heavy touch and as I've gone to pass to Jonesy (Dave Jones) I've caught him on the shin with the follow through of the pass. 'It wasn't intentional, of course. I would never go out on a football pitch to try and hurt an opponent. But there were so many different angles and it got picked out and scrutinised to the nth degree but you just have to get on with it. Martins Atkinson shows the red card to Matic after the Serbian pushed Barnes over in retaliation to the tackle . 'I don't really take anything from it. All I can do is apologise that I've caught him in that manner. As you can see nobody in the ground reacted and the next minute he came and pushed me over. Barnes said he was unaware at the time he had hurt the Serbian international: . 'Obviously I wouldn't have been happy if he had caught me there but as I say I've not meant it and I didn't know that I'd hurt him because it was just my momentum that took me that way. 'You're always going to get something like that in your life and I think that's one for me, but I like to think I deal with these things quite well.'

"Two of the teenagers who masterminded the Anzac Day terror plot in Melbourne had recently scouted police stations ahead of a possible attack. It comes as a friend of the teenagers who are believed to the planned attack in Melbourne revealed the moment the two young men 'became radicalised'. The man, who has not been identified, claims the death of Numan Haider was the moment 'we all became more radical', according to News Corp Australia. Scroll down for video . Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon . Multiple photos of Mr Besim on his social media pages show him posing with one raised index finger, a symbol that other ISIS supporters have also frequently used . He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) Haider was killed by police last year after he attacked officers with a knife, and is believed to have planned an ISIS-like attack. The two alleged ringleaders of the Anzac Day plot reportedly attended Haider's funeral. The information comes after police held one of the alleged ringleaders in jail under tough new terror laws, despite not being charged. The man, who cannot be identified due to suppression orders, could be held 14 days after police applied for a Preventive Detention Order. Another man, Sevdet Ramadan Besim, 18, was charged with planning to carry out an attack. Both men often visited frequented the controversial Al-Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale. It was also revealed the young men arrested on Saturday had personal links with a senior Australian jihadist and Islamic State recruiter in Syria. Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash, 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS, according to Fairfax Media. Prakash, who is know by the jihadist name Abu Khalid al-Kambodi, may have been in direct communication with the teenagers until recently. Prakash is thought of in the same way as Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer who was believed killed fighting around the Northern Syrian city of Kobane in late 2014.

"(CNN)Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. ""My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),"" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. ""It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner."" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. ""We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's,"" Mainzer wrote.

"People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13% higher than a colleague . The cost of divorce can wreck retirement many years after the break-up of a marriage, according to research. People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra £2,100 a year – £17,800 rather than £15,700 – to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages £22,100, Prudential’s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that £9,500 – the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday’s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse’s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests . The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce – usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse – does not fade away even as old age approaches. Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through ‘pension-splitting’ arrangements. One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research . Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: ‘Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. ‘A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the

Four orange signs each bearing a white heart and the word 'Boston' were placed at the site. They were mounted on poles wrapped in blue and yellow flowers, the marathon's colors, to mark the tragedy that took three lives and left more than 260 others injured. Martin's older brother Henry and younger sister Jane, who lost a leg in the explosion, helped unwrap one of the flags on the street as bagpipes played during the low-key ceremony. Scroll down for video . Somber: The Martin family, whose son Richard was killed in the Boston bombings, walk down Boylston Street with Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, left, ahead of a ceremony to mark two years since the tragedy .

Ceremony: Jane and Henry Martin remove a drape covering a memorial banner to honor the victims. In total, four large orange banners were unveiled near the explosion sites on Tuesday morning . Memories: The family takes a moment to reflect at the scene as a ceremony to mark the anniversary begins . The family of Krystle Campbell, who also died in the attacks, helped unwrap another banner with the help of Governor Charlie Baker. Also at the ceremony was Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the bombings. His ashen face was captured in a now-iconic photograph as he was wheeled away by strangers. One of those strangers, Carlos Arredondo, is now a close friend. Arredondo, who became known as 'the man in the cowboy hat' was also at the site on Tuesday morning to greet Bauman as he walked on prosthetic limbs. 'We're here to pay tribute to the people who lost their lives,' Bauman told WFXT-TV. They were joined by city officials including Mayor Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker.

"As a wealth management consultant for a prestigious London firm, Craig Lister is used to keeping his cool. But lately, that's become rather more difficult. Craig, 54, is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer, which starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body - and has the side-effect of hot flushes. 'I have about ten to 12 flushes a day, and six to eight at night,' says Craig, a Yorkshireman who lives in Watford, Hertfordshire, with wife Sue, a teacher, 52, and their three children, George, 22, Evie, 20, and Joseph, 18. Craig, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012. He is now well and his tumours have shrunk . 'I know when one's coming. The feeling suddenly builds up as if you've gone into a sauna. Within minutes I'm in full sweat. Five or ten minutes later, it's gone.' Craig has taken to carrying a spare shirt in his briefcase when he goes to meet clients. 'I'll turn up to a lunch and suddenly have a hot sweat and my shirt will be soaked,' he says. 'I nip off to the loos and have a wash and change.' Hormone therapy, usually given in the form of regular injections or implants, is the first treatment offered to men with advanced prostate cancer - where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. It can't cure the cancer, but can help keep it under control. Hormone therapy is also given alongside radiotherapy to some men with localised prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and make it easier to treat. The jabs typically contain drugs called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) blockers. These act on the pituitary gland in the brain, to stop the production of hormones which are released into the bloodstream and bind with cells in the testicles to make testosterone. Even though the cancer is now microscopic he is still taking hormone treatment . The majority of prostate cancers rely on the hormone to grow. Lowering the amount in the body means it's less able to spread. In England alone, 13,000 men receive the treatment every year - in the form of jabs given monthly or every three months according to the charity Prostate Cancer UK. However, blocking testosterone can cause a variety of side-effects, explains Ali Rooke, a specialist nurse at the charity. 'Testosterone is a man's natural source of energy, so along with hot flushes we often see fatigue. It also has an important role in sexual function, so there can be a loss of libido,' she says. 'There can be mood swings and depression; some men also report breast swelling, nipple tenderness and weight gain around the middle. All of these are similar to what women go through during the menopause, when levels of their equivalent hormone, oestrogen, start to fall.' Hormone therapy also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and can cause bone thinning, because testosterone is important for bone density. Studies by Prostate Cancer UK have found that 80 per cent of men having hormone therapy will suffer hot flushes,

"Aeroplanes are infamous as breeding grounds for bacteria, with tray tables, seats and blankets singled out as the worst offenders on board. But an entrepreneurial team are hoping their new invention will revolutionise the cleaning of aircraft and help airlines win the battle against bacteria . Arthur and Mo Kreitenberg have created a robot, called the Germfalcon, which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin. Scroll down for video . A father and son team have created a robot, called the Germfalcon, which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin . The seats, tray tables and blankets on an aeroplane are breeding ground for bacteria including E.coli . According to the businessmen, germs such as E.coli and MRSA can linger for up to a week on suraces within an aircraft and there are no clear rules on how often aeroplanes should be cleaned. But the family team has developed the unusual new robot as a way to counter issues with cleaning the interior of a plane - which currently only takes place a few times a year. When the plane is parked and empty, the device, which is the size of a drinks cart, patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself. As it does, it spreads its two 'wings' over the seats on either side. Those wings contain UV-C lamps, which are the same type used for disinfection in places like hospitals and water treatment plants. It also has UV-C lamps on its top and sides. Arthur and Mo Kreitenberg, from Los Angeles, said the 3.5billion people expected to fly this year risk falling ill due to poor plane hygiene. Writing on their Kickstarter page to raise money for their project, Mo said: 'Germs will survive on aeroplane surfaces sometimes for as long as seven days. 'There are no regulations or cleanliness standards for the passenger cabins of airplanes. Aeroplane travelers are at heightened risk of catching the common cold, flu, or more serious infections.' They said their device could spare passengers from catching illnesses when flying and give airlines a competitive edge. Last year a study from the Auburn University in Alabama discovered disease-causing bacteria can survive for up to a week inside plane cabins, on surfaces such as seat pockets, tray tables, window shades and armrests. When the plane is parked and empty, the device, which is the size of a drinks cart, patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself. As it does, it spreads its two 'wings' over the seats on either side . Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacteria that could cause infections, skin disease, pneumonia and sepsis, lived the longest (168 hours). Escherichia coli (E. coli), which can cause urinary tract infection, respiratory illness and diarrhoea, was found to survive for 96 hours. Mo added: 'The industry is growing aggressively. Implementing daily, routine airplane sanitization could disrupt or limit the rate bacteria and viruses spread, as the industry grows.

"A 10-year-old Michigan boy ran over his 9-year-old brother with a stolen car in the state's northern Lower Peninsula, authorities said. The younger boy was successfully freed and airlifted to a Flint hospital for treatment. The 9-year-old's ordeal took place after he and his older brother twice stole cars from a Village of Roscommon dealership. Investigation: A 10-year-old Michigan boy seemingly ran over his 9-year-old brother with a stolen car in the state's northern Lower Peninsula, authorities said. The two boys are believed to have used a cooler to break into a used car dealership (pictured) The Roscommon County Sheriff's Department responded at approximately 2:30am Sunday after receiving a call, Detective Sergeant John Wybraniec, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told Daily Mail Online. The boys live with their grandparents across the street from the used car dealership, he said. Wybraniec said deputies responded to the initial break-in and saw the lights were on inside, that a northeast window had been broken, and that there was a cooler underneath it. After securing the business, deputies noticed that vehicles outside were 'askew, not in a neat line that they normally are,' Wybraniec told Daily Mail Online. The sheriff's department said in a news release that thieves swiped car keys and wreaked havoc at the dealership by driving cars and slamming them around. The boys confessed to the joyrides, according to the sheriff's department. Wybraniec told Daily Mail Online said that the boys took out a 2009 Impala and a 2012 Malibu, and that a total of six vehicles were damaged. He said that deputies collected the car keys and the Department of Human Services was contacted. Deputies received a call around 11:30am on Sunday, Wybraniec said. The two boys took the same cars out and drove along Shelley Street. One car, the 2012 Malibu, slammed into a snow bank and got stuck, he said. Wybraniec said that the 10-year-old was behind the wheel of the 2009 Impala that he seemingly drove over his brother. 'We think it's inadvertently,' he told Daily Mail Online. The boy was found underneath the car in a vacant lot next to their house. Wybraniec said that the boys' grandmother discovered the 9-year-old pinned underneath and contacted 911. Wybraniec said it didn't appear his injuries were life-threatening, but that their extent is unknown. He said that deputies do not know the motive for stealing the cars, but that it appears the pair snuck out after their grandparents went to sleep and used the cooler for the break-in. The brothers, who both have learning disabilities, spoke to police and will be interviewed this week by a Children's Assessment Center specialist, Wybraniec said. Charges are possible but unlikely, he said.

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall hopes injured Newcastle winger Shane Ferguson could play a surprise role in the club's play-off bid. The Northern Ireland capped midfielder was sent north by the Magpies as part of a five-man package on the final day of the January transfer window. But Gers missed the fact he was carrying a long-term knee injury when they failed to carry out a medical. Stuart McCall confident Shane Ferguson can play a vital role in Rangers push for promotion to the SPL . Ferguson, 23, only checked in to the club's Murray Park training base on Monday after he was finally given the green light to resume action. Now McCall has revealed the Derry-born wide man could make his Gers bow as the Ibrox side look to climb back to the Premiership through the play-offs. The Light Blues boss said: 'I was really pleased yesterday when I saw him training. When you have been out for so long with a knee ligament injury, it's not just the physical aspect but the mental one. 'But he was really positive. I've had a wee chat with him and he's desperate to get involved. 'He's a wee bit away from match fitness and won't be ready to play in the next week or two because he's been out too long. The on-loan Newcastle United wide man has been out injured since he joined the club but is back training . 'But he is mentally in the right place, as in he is here to help, and he could be a welcome addition for the back end of the season.' The deal which saw Ferguson, Haris Vuckic, Gael Bigirimana, Kevin Mbabu and Remie Streete swap St James' Park for Ibrox has proved controversial. So far, only Vuckic has played regularly. Street picked up an injury on his debut against Raith and has not been seen since, while the other three arrived packing injury and fitness issues. But there was another sting in the tail for the frustrated Gers faithful when they learned the deal included a clause which meant their club would have to give Newcastle owner Mike Ashley a £500,000 cheque if they won promotion. McCall, though, joked he would be happy to hand over the cash if it meant he had succeeded in reclaiming Gers' top-flight slot. He said: 'It was a surprise to everyone when the news about that came out, because it's quite a lot of money, especially when only one of them is playing. 'But if it was me - and it's not because it's not my money - I'd love to give Newcastle £500,000 because that means we have got promotion.' Having made 23 appearances for his parent club, Ferguson will be a welcome addition to the squad . Ashley's standing in Govan took another pounding last week too when it emerged the club's iconic trademarks and badges had been registered on a government website in the name of his Sports Direct firm. The billionaire tycoon loaned the previous regime running the club £5million in January and took

"Charges against Andrew Hamblin, 23, stem from a domestic disturbance Sunday at a residence in Campbell County . An East Tennessee pastor who has appeared on a reality television show about handling snakes in church faces charges of assault and reckless endangerment. Charges against Andrew Hamblin, 23, stem from a domestic disturbance Sunday at a residence in Campbell County. No-one was injured. Elizabeth Hamblin told officers that as she was leaving a park with her four children and Jeremy Henegar, Andrew Hamblin got behind them, and pointed a handgun from his vehicle, reports Knox News. The warrant does not specify the relationship between Henegar and Elizabeth Hamblin, but it states the two share the Hickory Hills residence. Elizabeth Hamblin said that when she arrived home Hamblin pulled up in front of their residence and waved a handgun before he fired a shot in the air. She claims he then pointed a gun at Henegar and fired a second time, missing Henegar and striking the residence, before fleeing. Deputies say Elizabeth Hamblin’s infant child was in the home at the time. Investigators recovered a bullet that was fired into the residence. Hamblin is the pastor of the Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, which uses snake handling in services.

Deputies say Elizabeth Hamblin’s infant child was in the home at the time . He has appeared on the reality show 'Snake Salvation' on the National Geographic Channel. Hamblin was due in court for arraignment Monday. It wasn't immediately clear whether he had an attorney to reach for comment. In 2013, state wildlife officials seized 53 copper heads and rattlesnakes from Hamblin and cited him for illegally keeping them, but a grand jury declined to indict him. In 2014 Hamblin and his worshipers were evicted from their church because of their fondness for handling venomous snakes while praying and dancing. Clyde Daugherty, who built the LaFollette, Tennessee-based church in 1994, rented the building to Andrew Hamblin for just $267 a month but eventually became fed up with all the serpents slithering about and occasionally injuring or killing congregants. 'Too many people were getting hurt and dying, and that's a proven fact,' Mr Daugherty told . 'He was focused too much on the wrong things, like attention from the media and the TV show, instead of the word of God.'

"The leader of Kazakhstan has apologised after winning the presidential election with 97 per cent of the vote saying it would have been 'undemocratic' for him to make his victory more modest. Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote . But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. Kazakh economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.5 percent this year from a 4.3 percent rise in 2014. Gross domestic product may actually shrink if oil prices drop to below $50 per barrel, Kazakh officials have said.

"This is the moment when a not-so-little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle. Charlene Fritz, 35, was visiting Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach. Despite being no more than two months old, the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs, and Ms Fritz had a struggle sitting upright. Scroll down for video . One big cuddle: The elephant seal is thought to have been no more than two months old, but at a whopping 200lbs, Canadian tourist Charlene Fritz still struggled to reciprocate the hug . Making friends: Ms Fritz had the surprise of a lifetime when the baby elephant seal came out of the water for a cuddle during an expedition to Snow Hill Island in the Antarctic Peninsula . Will you be my mummy? Elephant seal pups are abandoned by their mothers at just one month to learn how to take care of themselves . Charlene, from Saskatchewan, Canada, said: 'The seal climbed on top of me without hesitation. We shared a very sweet moment in time I will never forget. 'Her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into. Like the deepest depths of the sea. I could have stared into her eyes forever.' She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath.

"(CNN)It's a golfing paradise forged from the ashes of the space race. And, according to owner Dave Pelz, it might just be the best back garden on the planet. One thing is certain, no self-respecting golfer would emerge from a stint patrolling the perfectly coiffured turf at Chez Pelz in Austin, Texas any worse around the greens. ""They say it's the world's best backyard,"" one of golf's most renowned short game coaches, and former NASA employee, told CNN's Living Golf show. ""It's my dream. I have a dream job and I live in my dream house. I live with my dream girl. I'm a happy guy."" It's no wonder Pelz is content. His named is etched in the evolution of golf. His students, including five-time major champion Phil Mickelson, have amassed a combined 20 majors between them and as one of golf's most fertile brains, Pelz has 26 golf patents to his name. The 70-year-old still works with Mickelson prior to major tournaments and the player known as ""Lefty""credits Pelz with helping to elevate his game to the elite level. ""I was 0-for-43 in majors before I met him, and I've won four, plus a Players Championship since,"" Mickelson was quoted as saying prior to capturing his fifth major -- the British Open -- in 2013. ""That says it all about him, in my book."" The septuagenarian pioneered the use of statistics back in the 1970s and 80s, his analysis of the game sculpted by a 15-year stint working for space agency NASA. His insistence on short game practice, and invention of clubs to help players hone their skills in that department, have informed the modern professional's approach. ""I did space research and golf research on my own time,"" explained the brains behind the two-ball putter, one of the best-selling clubs of all time that helped golfers line up their putts more accurately. ""NASA has the most unbelievable equipment in the world and that was the dawn of the space race. Sputnik had just gone up. ""We were trying to catch the Russians in terms of space exploration. And I got in a wonderful group of scientists and learned to do honest to God research."" Pelz banked a place at Indiana University thanks to a golf scholarship and chose to study physics. He famously played the legendary Jack Nicklaus 22 times and lost to the 18-time major champion on every occasion, but made significant improvements to his game once he began working for NASA. Using the one variable at a time method favored by scientists, Pelz began grading his own performance using the methods he'd picked up at the Goddard Space Flight Center. And gradually, piece by piece, he began to deconstruct each facet of his game and isolate the improvements he needed to make. ""I started measuring my own putting,"" he said. ""I started measuring my short game. I started measuring my driving. ""I learned how to measure things at Goddard Space Flight Center because they had the best instruments in the world and I learned the practical application of the

"MI5 covered up the sexual abuse of boys in the notorious Kincora home, a former Army Intelligence officer claimed last night. Brian Gemmell, a former captain in the Intelligence Corps, said spy chiefs ordered him to ‘stop digging’ when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the Northern Ireland children’s’ home. He spoke out during a meeting with victim Richard Kerr, who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from the home before being molested by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile gang. Scroll down for video . Brian Gemmell, a former captain in the Army Intelligence Corps (pictured), said MI5 spy chiefs ordered him to ‘stop digging’ when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the Northern Ireland children’s’ home, Kincora . He claimed he was sexually abused by politicians and other senior men at Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico and Elm Guest House, in Barnes, west London, which are being investigated by Scotland Yard amid ‘credible’ claims a Tory MP murdered a young boy. Campaigners claim Mr Kerr’s account provides a clear link between VIP paedophile rings in London and Belfast. MI5 has faced long-standing allegations of covering up child abuse to enable it to gather intelligence on Loyalist politicians during the Troubles. But it has also been accused of not acting to protect leading Establishment figures involved in the crimes. Mr Gemmell, who served in military intelligence in Belfast, presented a report on allegations of abuse at Kincora to a senior MI5 officer in 1975 but to his astonishment was told to quit his probe. Speaking to Mr Kerr on Channel 4 News, he said: ‘That’s the thing that hits me - that if I really pushed the thing through, you could have been rescued. I’m sorry.’ His revelations will strengthen calls for the allegations about the Irish children’s home to be covered by the judge-led abuse inquiry announced by Home Secretary Theresa May. The inquiry will investigate whether public bodies, including governments, charities, the Church and BBC, failed to protect children. It was set up amid claims a child sex gang operated in Westminster in the 1980s. The investigation into historical abuse, which will be led by New Zealand High Court judge, Justice Lowell Goddard, is likely to be able to study files held by MI5. Mr Gemmell said: ‘I think Richard’s transporting over to the United Kingdom mainland to be abused, rather than just being abused in Northern Ireland, speaks volumes. It ties the two together.’ Mr Gemmell met with victim Richard Kerr, who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from Kincora (pictured) before being molested by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile gang . Speaking to Channel 4 News, Mr Kerr, who now lives in Dallas, Texas, said he and two other boys suffered abuse at Kincora in the mid-1970s before being trafficked to London in 1977, where they suffered further abuse. Boys - many in local authority care - are alleged to have been abused by figures including the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, Cabinet ministers, clergymen, pop stars,

"President Barack Obama threw off the gloves and took a direct punch at one of his possible successors, likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker, in an interview airing this morning. Responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office, Obama told NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep that such an approach 'would be foolish.' 'And, you know, perhaps Mr. Walker, after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy, will feel the same way,' the president added. Walker fired back at Obama on Twitter, saying, 'Americans would be better served by a President who spent more time working with governors & Congress rather than attacking them.'

Obama's jab at Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term. The current administration has been more willing to weigh in, however, when a presumed Republican candidate threatens to dismantle one of the president's prized domestic or foreign policies, which, in the case of Walker, was the nuclear arrangement with Iran. 'I am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedents of presidential power that they won't start calling to question the capacity of the executive branch of the United States to enter into agreements with other countries,' Obama told Inskeep during their Monday afternoon chat following the NPR host's invocation of Walker's past comments. 'If that starts being questioned, that's going to be a problem for our friends and that's going to embolden our enemies.' Continuing, Obama said, that 'would be a foolish approach to take' and slammed Walker. A cadre of probable Republican presidential contenders have spoken out against the Obama administration's laboriously negotiated pact with Iran to stunt the growth of the country's program. Walker is the only one to say he would not honor his predecessor's deal with Iran and the international community if elevated to presidency, however. 'If I ultimately choose to run, and if I’m honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing — not just for the region but for this world — we need is a nuclear-armed Iran,' he told radio host Charlie Sykes last week.

After taking advice from the League Managers’ Association, the 53-year-old has benefited from sessions with former international cricketer Jeremy Snape, now a sports psychologist. Alan Pardew called Manuel Pellegrini a 'f***ing old c**t' during Premier League encounter back in . The touchline spat occurred during a Premier League match between Newcastle and Man City in January 2014 . ‘My natural instinct is to be aggressive in the way my teams play,’ Pardew told the BBC. ‘But I have had to learn from my own experiences and not get too involved in that myself. Jeremy has helped me on the sidelines in terms of focusing on what I can control. ‘All the times I have been in trouble (I have reacted) when I felt an injustice so when those issues arise now, I know not to react and that is when I switch the off button.’ Pellegrini’s team are under a little pressure.

But if I work in this part of the league for the rest of my career I will be extremely happy,’ he said. Pellegrini said recently he felt his City squad lacked one really big player.

Wilshere was a Hitchin boy, spotted early by Luton’s scouts before Arsenal took him to their Hale End academy at nine. At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger’s side. Charlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham . Like Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town . Soon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder. The Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season. ‘We just want what’s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,’ said dad Julio on Wednesday. ‘He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.’ Charlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. ‘Other parents have commented on it in the past,’ admitted Julio. The big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA’s compensation guidelines. The transfer fee involved is £10,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton. There are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision. Charlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost £10,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton . 11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona . Julio’s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports. Julio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: ‘Charlie doesn’t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.’ Charlie’s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents’ home in

"Founder: The charity was set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996 . A leading children’s charity is facing a crisis after three of its directors resigned amid an apparent row over funding, it was revealed yesterday. Kids Company has received around £30 million of public money since 2008 and has celebrity backers including rock group Coldplay, businessman Sir Richard Branson and Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996, it supports 36,000 vulnerable children in London, Bristol and Liverpool and has been championed by Prince Charles and David Cameron. But concerns about the way the charity is run are understood to have led some senior managers to raise issues with its board of trustees. The resignations of interim finance director Diane Hamilton, human resources chief Adrian Stones and director of development Mandy Lloyd then followed. A statement from Kids Company said: ‘It was with great regret that they felt unable to continue working within the organisation because of the uncertainty of funding, which led to high levels of stress in the workplace which was unsustainable.’ But a source close to the directors reportedly said: ‘These departures are a direct result of these employees’ doubts about the future of Kids Company ... The trustees were told of their doubts but they don’t seem to have reacted at all.’ Miss Batmanghelidjh, a trained psychotherapist, became known as ‘Mother Camila of Camberwell’ for her work with some of South London’s most disadvantaged children. Michael Gove is said to have tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012 . Born in Iran, she is known for her colourful style. In 2013 she was named one of Britain’s 100 most powerful women by Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour and appointed a CBE. The Sunday Times reported that the resignations were revealed as she denied persuading Mr Cameron to intervene after then education secretary Michael Gove tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012. Miss Batmanghelidjh said that an independent audit in 2014 showed ‘the charity was well run but lacked funding’. But critics have questioned whether it is over-staffed – it employs around 600 people.

"A 19-year-old man has been indicted on murder and other charges in the shooting death of a Las Vegas mother of four in a neighborhood gunbattle. The indictment filed Friday accuses defendant Erich Milton Nowsch Jr. of murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle. The shooting was initially characterized as road rage but was later found to involve more complex relationships. Scroll down for video . Erich Nowsch Jr. (pictured in a Las Vegas courtroom February 23) was indicted Friday on charges of murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle in the killing of Tammy Meyers . The indictment doesn't name a getaway driver in the February 12 killing of 44-year-old Tammy Meyers. Her husband, Robert Meyers, says she took their daughter home after a late-night driving lesson and fetched her 22-year-old son with his gun to find a driver who frightened her earlier. The 19-year-old's defense team hope the request to the coroner's office will be able to determine whether Meyers, 44, or somebody next to her fired a gun before she died . Police say the son fired several shots at Nowsch during the fatal shootout in a cul-de-sac outside the Meyers home. The 44-year-old Meyers was wounded in the head February 12 and died two days later. Nowsch was arrested on February 19. Nowsch's defense team said in court today they are trying to obtain surveillance video from Johnson Junior High School, where Meyers was allegedly teaching her daughter to parallel park the night before the shooting. They also want police to turn over radio recordings from the night of the shooting and the day of Nowach's arrest, reported Las Vegas Review Journal. The 19-year-old is being held without bail. He is due back in court March 12. Many questions remain after conflicting accounts from authorities and Meyers' family about what initially was characterized as a road rage attack. Following Nowsch's arrest late last month, his lawyers said he was high on marijuana while he was being questioned, and police knew it. He surrendered to the authorities after a stand-off in suburban Las Vegas. Claus said he plans to argue in court that anything Nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial. It's not clear what Nowsch told detectives after his arrest. 'People tend to say things that aren't entirely credible when they're under the influence,' he told the Associated Press. Attorney Augustus Claus said 'not only' did the police let Nowsch smoke, they 'watched him do it' as they tried 'to talk him down' during a standoff that involved a helicopter and a SWAT team. Last week, Claus said he may consider using a fractured skull Nowsch suffered as an infant at the hands of his abuse father in his defense. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson will consider Nowsch's childhood injury while deciding whether to seek the death penalty against him. Nowsch has been accused of shooting 44-year-old Tammy Meyers dead during an act of road rage. It has since

"James Bond may like his Martini shaken, not stirred, but the fictional spy hasn't had to contend with zero gravity when sipping his favourite tipple. Making cocktails in space is a difficult business, but now there’s a specially designed ‘glass’ in the pipeline that promises to force liquid to stay put. Grooves in the 3D printed vessel will let astronauts enjoy the aroma of a beverage and keep the fluid in place so they can drink in a way they are used to on Earth. Scroll down for videos . A Californian company has designed a martini glass (pictured alongside a cup) intended for zero gravity that has ridges to ensure liquid stays inside it and can be sipped by an astronaut . A company called Cosmic Lifestyle Corp (CLC) in Oakland, California came up with the design - which is a work in progress - to solve the problem of drinking in space. Nasa once developed ‘parabolic sherry’ and astronauts have been known to have a swig of vodka, but drinking from a conventional glass is difficult. This is because liquid becomes sticky and clumps together in blobs in zero gravity. If a glob of water is broken, for example, it splits into many smaller blobs that scatter everywhere and are hard to clean up. To solve this problem, liquid is typically kept in bags with attachment for straws, but while this is practical, it’s not an elegant solution and means astronauts can’t smell the liquid, which is naturally less pungent and tasteless in zero gravity. The start-up chose to 3D print the cup so the complicated design can be refined quickly – with each design taking around 15 hours to print. Because there is already a printer on the ISS, the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away, without the need to transport the delicate vessels. Image shows early versions . In the 1979 film, Moonraker, James Bond, played by Roger Moore (a poster is shown), has a space adventure but doesn't attempt to drink his signature martini in space . The first step is drop the glass inside a 102ft-tall lift at Portland State University, to produce two seconds of weightlessness, so that the durability of the glass and how different fluids react, can be tested. Experts will use a high speed camera to look at what is happening and refine the design. Researchers will then conduct live tests with humans on a parabolic aircraft or ‘vomit comet’. One unofficial test has already taken place. The ultimate goal is to 3D print a ‘glass’ on the ISS. ‘The Zero Gravity Cocktail Project is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment,’ the company said. ‘We are creating an open air drinking container that allows you to enjoy the aroma of the drink, yet keep the fluids under control. ‘Your mouth completes the connection like a straw and you can suck the drink into your mouth.’ The ‘glass,’ which is said to ‘combine the beauty of a classic martini glass with the physics of space science’ has

"Footage has emerged of doomed Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan speaking about second chances just hours after the first round of executions on January 18. The heartbreaking video shows Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail. Behind him prison bars are visible as he looks tearily into the camera and talks in soft spoken tones. Scroll down for video . The heartbreaking video shows Andrew Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail . The 30-second video was aired on Channel Seven's Sunday Night. 'My name's Andrew Chan,' the convicted drug smuggler said. 'It's a day - pretty much a few hours - after the execution of six innocent lives. 'Guess what runs through my head is about how precious life really is.' On January 18, five people were executed by firing squad on Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island - in Central Java. Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, Malawi's Namaona Denis and Indonesia's Rani Adriani were killed that day. Another woman Tran Bich Hanh, from Vietnam, was also put to death nearby. Myuran Sukuraman (right) revealed he knew the identity of ringleader Mr Big and tried to strike a deal with Indonesian police to spare his life, while Chan (left) denied he knew anything about him . Kerobokan prison had been the Bali Nine duo's home for 10 years after they were found guilty of drug smuggling . Their deaths triggered Chan to ask: 'I guess sometimes you kinda got to think, what does it take to get a second chance? 'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you’re a convicted criminal.' Since they were sentenced to death, Chan converted to Christianity and studied to become a pastor while behind bars. At the same time, Sukuraman - under the tutelage of Ben Quilty - has become an artist, even teaching inmates how to paint. This turnaround in the pair has led many to believe they have been rehabilitated. Sunday Night also revealed fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukuraman knew the identity of 'Mr Big' - the ringleader of the group - but did not want to name him publicly as he feared for the safety his family. Sukuraman told the news program he had tried to trade this information to avoid the death penalty, but Indonesian police refused the offer. Myuran Sukuraman (left) and Andrew Chan (right) are being led to an armoured vehicle at Cilacap airport in Central Java on Wednesday . 'We tried with the police to get some sort of co-operation thing but there weren't really like that was our only card that we had to play,' he said. 'They wouldn't and then the lawyers advised us not to go that way.' While Chan said he did not know the identity of the mystery ringleader.

"Keith Thurman and Robert Guerrero gave a prime-time television audience something to watch Saturday night. Thurman won a piece of the welterweight title with a bruising decision win over Guerrero in the debut of a new boxing series on network television. And he did it with the kind of fight that had the crowd on its feet and gave a much needed boost to boxing in the first prime-time fights on NBC in 30 years. 'That's kind of performance that wins the hearts of fans even when you don't win the fight,' Guerrero said. 'The fans love that and that's what boxing is all about.' Keith Thurman (left) lands a left jab on Robert Guerrero during their WBA welterweight title bout . The fight was the highlight of a card that also included a win by Adrien Broner over John Molina in a super lightweight bout. But while fans booed that fight for lack of action, they cheered from the opening bell as Thurman took apart Guerrero in a fight that had a little bit of something for every fan - except a knockout. 'I know I was hurting him each and every round,' Thurman said. 'But he's a veteran and knew how to pace himself and stay a little out of my range.' Thurman knocked Guerrero down in the ninth round and won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown. But Guerrero fought hard and wasn't afraid to trade punches even while bleeding from a cut over his left eye late in the bout. A bloodied Guerrero rises to his feet after he was knocked down by Thurman in the ninth round . Thurman is sent to the neutral corner by referee Kenny Bayless as Guerrero recovers on the canvas . Thurman landed 211 of 598 punches to 104 of 497 for Guerrero, but that didn't tell the whole story. Thurman's punches were much harder and seemed to shake Guerrero on several occasions, though they didn't deter him from pressing the fight even after being knocked down and nearly knocked out in the ninth round. 'I keep fighting my heart out and that's what the fans like about me,' Guerrero said . Thurman won every round on one ringside scorecard and 10 rounds on the other two, using thudding punches to keep Guerrero away. Still, he was never able to put him away and Guerrero came back in the 10th round to land some big punches of his own while Thurman was on the ropes. 'Robert Guerrero was a tremendous warrior,' Thurman said. 'He was there the whole way.' Thurman won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown . It was a signature win for Thurman, and not only because he was showcased on the top of the television card. He beat a fighter who fought Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2012, lasting all 12 rounds though dropping a lopsided decision. And he remained unbeaten in 25 fights with a performance that could put him in

"The good news for all concerned in Monaco was that it had stopped raining. Arsene Wenger had raised fears on the eve of the game and as the downpour continued into the night the Arsenal manager wasn't the only one casting anxious glances skywards.

Much has happened to Monaco since then. They almost dropped into the third tier of French football and faced extinction before Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev came to the rescue and got them moving in the right direction once again. The first leg result against Arsenal was confirmation that the Rybolovlev project is still on track, having survived a change of direction and an exodus of top players like James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao last summer.

"Nigel Farage has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten, it can be revealed. Ukip, which will today unveil its manifesto, has reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls. A party strategist said 'something extraordinary' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list. Nigel Farage has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten . South Thanet, Kent (Majority: Con 7,617) Clacton, Essex (Ukip 12,404) Rochester & Strood, Kent (Ukip 2,920) Thurrock, Essex (Con 92) Great Grimsby, Lincs (Labour 714) Boston & Skegness, Lincs (Con 12,426) Camborne & Redruth, Cornwall (Con 66) Dudley North, West Midlands (Lab 649) Castle Point, Essex (Cons 7,632) Heywood & Middleton, Greater Manchester (Lab 617) After Ukip won the Rochester and Strood by-election last November and gained its second MP, Mr Farage said the party could go on to win 'dozens of seats' in the election. But Ukip campaign chiefs have now adopted a 'shotgun' approach with a far fewer targets. Mr Farage will this morning launch the party's manifesto in Thurrock, Essex. A Ukip source said: 'It will be a broad and open offer to those on low and middle incomes. That's something which no other party is doing.' Among the seats dropped from the list of hopefuls is Folkestone and Hythe, where candidate Janice Atkinson was replaced after allegations of fraudulent expenses claims. The target list includes South Thanet, where Mr Farage is standing, along with Clacton and Rochester and Strood, where Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless won by-elections after defecting from the Tories. The party also hopes to win in Thurrock, a tight three-way marginal where the Tories are defending a majority of just 92. Another focus is Heywood and Middleton, in Greater Manchester, where it narrowly lost a by-election to Labour last October. Ukip's election co-ordinator Chris Bruni-Lowe, who masterminded last year's by-election wins, is organising campaigns in the ten targets. The party is helping write campaign literature, organising mailshots to voters and putting up billboards, while other candidates are mostly being left to their own devices. Clacton, where Tory defector Douglas Carswell (left) is standing for Ukip, is one of the few seats the party still thinks he can win . Ukip's immigration spokesman has admitted that even the leadership of the party has been left confused by its policy on foreigners moving to Britain. At an event last month Steven Woolfe said the deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, who has written Ukip's manifesto, did not understand the immigration policy even when he showed her diagrams to explain it. It is claimed that Mr Woolfe, who was speaking after a meeting in Dudley, said: 'The problem is, even within my own party, my own deputy chairman, didn't seem to understand it herself despite the fact I actually put picture graphs. 'I put the numbers on and the point is people confuse immigration. Immigration consists of loads of

"Caller ID as we know it could be getting a revamp. Facebook has launched a new app called Hello designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers. Scroll down for video . Facebook has launched a new app called Hello (pictured) designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers . The free app is currently in testing and is only available on Android devices in the US. It is expected to roll out to other regions and devices if testing is successful. 'Billions of calls are made everyday on mobile phones and people often have very little information about who’s calling them,' explained Facebook's product manager Andrea Vaccari in a blog post. Facebook has tweaked its News Feed setting to make posts from friends more prominent. The rules about seeing multiple posts from the same person in a row have been relaxed to show more from friends. Content posted directly by friends who people interact with more or have a direct relationship with will now appear higher up in News Feed so they are less likely to miss it. The latest update will also make posts and Pages that friends have liked and commented on appear lower down. Facebook said: 'The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you. 'This means we need to give you the right mix of updates from friends and businesses. 'This balance is different for everyone [and] as more people and pages are sharing more content, we need to keep improving News Feed to get this balance right.' 'Today we are starting to test Hello, a new app built by the Messenger team. 'Hello connects with Facebook so you can see who’s calling, block unwanted calls and search for people and places.' When a user receives a call, Hello shows them info about who’s calling, even if they don’t have that number saved. Users will only see information that people have already shared on Facebook, and not everyone links their mobile number to their account so this could be the app's downfall. Callers must also have a Facebook account in order for the data to be shared but they don't necessarily have to be logged in at the time of the call. They also don't need to have Hello installed, either. Another feature of Hello includes making it easier to block unwanted calls. From the settings menu in Hello people can block specific numbers and adjust whether they want to automatically block calls from commonly blocked numbers. This is useful for blocking company phone numbers or spam callers, for example, and blocked calls go straight to voicemail.

"A New Zealand couple needed a home upon returning home after living in the UK, so they built one on the back of an old flatbed truck. Hannah and Alex purchased a 1986 Hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love. The result was a solar-powered two-bedroom, wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in Nelson, New Zealand. How a truck becomes a home: A New Zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck . Making do: Alex (left) and Hannah (right) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own, but couldn't afford to buy a full-sized lot . 'We came back to New Zealand from the UK in 2009,' Alex told Smoking Tire. 'We knew we couldn't afford to buy property at that point. We didn't have money.' So, the couple started building. After a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time, the project took shape. Though, to hear Hannah tell it, they just slapped up the place in a weekend. '[We] welded a frame, put the wood on and built this house,' the modest Kiwi told Smoking Tire's Matt Farah. Once they finished, the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they'd purchased in Nelson, New Zealand. Now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature: aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees and a babbling brook outside their door. Ingenuity: The couple started with a steel frame and slowly, project by project, built a home in about a year and a half . Gorgeous: Hannah and Alex now have a gorgeous, wood-lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook . Details: The couple has a wood-fired stove to keep out the cold, stained glass windows and other creature comforts . They're nearly self-sufficient, too. The home is powered mostly by solar panels. Alex said their first power bill was just $25. The stove and hot water are gas-powered and water comes from a nearby spring. 'I didn't want to live inside a plastic box,' Alex said. 'Not because I'm a hippie but because it feels nicer and is just a nicer place to be.' All told, the project cost Hannah and Alex about $25,000. And the couple even plans to build another one like one day. 'It's really, really nice,' Hannah said. 'We love it.' Two bedrooms: The home has a bedroom for the couple as well as a loft that doubles as a spare room where the cat sleeps . Green: Water comes from a nearby spring and most of the electricity comes from solar panels .

"Lee Dyer, 40, (pictured), has been sentenced to five years in prison after trying to smuggle £8million worth of liquid amphetamine across the border . A van driver who tried to smuggle £8million worth of liquid amphetamine in wine bottles has been jailed for five years. Lee Dyer, 40, from St Helens, Merseyside was stopped by Border Force officers at the Channel Tunnel terminal in Coquelles, France last May and told them he had been in Belgium doing plastering and collecting solar panels. Officers found boxes containing more than 100 wine bottles in the back of Dyer's van, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. The substance inside the bottles appeared oily and later checks showed the liquid tested positive for amphetamine. Dyer was arrested and checks on the van showed it had been hired in Warrington, with Dyer supplying the hire company with a false address. For previous trips he had also used hired vehicles, taking them abroad illegally. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne at street-level purity, with a potential street value of almost £8million. Last month, Dyer admitted importing controlling drugs and he was today sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne, with a potential street value of almost £8million . Matthew Rivers, from the NCA's Border Policing Command, said: 'The story Dyer told to explain his trips to the continent was a lie. Our investigation proved that in reality he was a professional courier who travelled to the Netherlands to source drugs. 'This was a huge quantity of amphetamine, enough to make many hundreds of thousands of street-level doses and fuel further criminal activity.' Paul Morgan, director of Border Force South East and Europe, said: 'This seizure means a significant quantity of drugs failed to reach the streets and demonstrates Border Force's commitment to keeping them out of the UK. 'We work closely with law enforcement colleagues, including the NCA, to prevent drug trafficking and do all we can to put those responsible behind bars.'

"Former PM Tony Blair was given an award for his 'global legacy' by Save the Children last year . Save the Children has apologised over its decision to give Tony Blair an award for his 'global legacy' after a furious public backlash. Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision, but insisted it was only meant to mark his work in Africa and not his entire time in Number 10. Mr Forsyth, a former Downing Street aide, admitted it would have been 'wrong' to give an award to the former PM for his political legacy rather than for his work on international aid. Mr Blair was handed an award for spending billions of taxpayers' money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year. The former PM, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid, was given the charity's Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development. But the award sparked widespread fury when it was announced in November. More than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the award to be rescinded and around 500 Saved the Children staff members have reportedly backed a similar petition. Questioned about the award on the BBC's Today programme this morning, Mr Forsyth said: 'I know that many of our supporters and volunteers were very upset and our staff, several of our staff too, and I'm very sorry for that.' He said the decision had been made by the British charity's 'sister organisation' in the US and insisted the award was only for his Africa work. Mr Forsyth said: 'Yes, it was a global legacy award. It was called that. But actually it was an award very, very specifically for Tony Blair's efforts on Africa at two G8 summits at Birmingham and Gleneagles, not his wider legacy. 'And if it had been for his wider legacy I think it would be wrong, but it was for something quite specific that helped Africa and children. 'I'm sorry it's upset so many people. It's not really what we do at Save the Children. What we're really doing is on the ground in Syria with the Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone – that's the work we do. 'This has been really an unnecessary distraction. I do apologise to those people that it's upset.' Justin Forsyth (left), the charity's chief executive pictured in Lebanon with Samantha Cameron, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision to honour Tony Blair . Mr Blair was handed the award for spending billions of public money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year - also attended by Mike Bezos (centre left), Dakota Fanning (centre right), and Nicholas Kristo (right) Mr Forsyth admitted the row had 'in part' damaged the charity in eyes of some staff but expressed hope people would accept organisations 'make mistakes'.

Bale Shbaka Kaza (left) came to his aid . Tribute: Mr Wallace posted this tribute to Mr Matson on Sunday afternoon after speaking to his widow . 'He didn't hesitate and took off after me,' Mr Wallace told The Detroit News. 'When he got to me we were both hanging on to the board and trying to paddle towards shore. I don't think we even said anything to each other. Suddenly he let go and went under. I think he had a heart attack right then.' He added: 'I feel so sorry for that man. 'Someone who gave their life for me ... I've been doing a lot of crying this week.' Another man, Bale Shbaka Kaza, eventually spotted Mr Wallace and rescued him from the rocky-based ocean with bare feet. Mr Matson's widow, Annette, said he likely had an epileptic seizure.

"Arsenal are eyeing up a move for Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus to replace Theo Walcott. The England winger risked irking Arsene Wenger by claiming talks over a new deal have not started, despite the Gunners boss repeatedly stating the opposite. Wenger confirmed the club's intention to offer Walcott a new contract in February and when asked about whether talks had started on March 13, the Gunners boss replied: 'The first contacts have been made and we will see how that progresses.' However, Walcott, who currently earns £90,000-per-week, took to Twitter to contradict his manager. Arsenal are already looking at potential replacements for Theo Walcott, as his contract comes to an end . Walcott has not completed 90 minutes for his club since January 2014, and wants over £100,000 a week . Walcott has only recently returned from injury and is struggling to hold down a regular first-team place . In response to TV reports that he had been involved in a training-ground bust-up with Wenger, Walcott tweeted: 'I don't normally comment on false stories about myself but reports about contract demands and bust-ups with the boss are complete nonsense. 'There have been no contract talks as yet and my current focus is not on contracts but on doing my best for Arsenal FC.' Walcott's tweet made for an intriguing twist in what is already turning out to be another uncomfortable contract extension saga between Arsenal and the England international. The 26-year-old wants north of £100,000-per-week to sign a new contract at the Emirates Stadium. Given he is not a first-team regular, the Arsenal hierarchy are showing a reluctance to meet Walcott's pay demands. Likewise, Walcott is growing increasingly frustrated at his lack of game time since returning from a long-term knee injury. Walcott goes through his paces alongside fellow Arsenal and England star Kieran Gibbs on Thursday . Walcott, who is out of contract at the Emirates stadium next summer, trains alongside Harry Kane . The England winger took to social media to deny the claims that he and Arsene Wenger had fallen out . Walcott enters the final year of his contract at the end of the season and the Gunners will consider cashing in on the speedster in the summer, for a fee of around £15million, to avoid losing him for nothing in 2016. And Sportsmail understands the club have already started identifying targets to replace Walcott if the contract stand-off cannot be resolved. Dortmund forward Reus will lead the list of candidates to fill Walcott's shoes if he leaves north London this summer. Theo Walcott has denied a bust-up with Arsenal over his new contract negotiations . Arsenal could turn their attentions back to Marco Reus if Walcott were to leave in the summer . Reus, who scored for Germany against Australia on Wednesday, has long been a favourite of Wenger . The Gunners failed in an attempt to sign the Germany international last summer, but retain a strong interest. The club's global network of spies have been instructed to pinpoint potential candidates should Walcott leave. Given Walcott's

Seven of Slager's fellow cops responded to his call forback-up after the shooting - as handcuffed Walter Scott lay dead or dying with five bullet wounds to the back. But the fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting given to the media, or in the force's incident report filed after the shooting. Officers also told an internal report that they gave Scott CPR, but the video only shows them checking his pulse and standing over his body. One officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body. Scroll down for video . Questions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPR . Scott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.' Slager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened. 'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser — as trained by the department — and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said. 'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.' On Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation. There are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows. It is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation. The video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground. As Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body. Haberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away. Radio records show that an officer reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back. Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down. The same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed is two sentences. The second reads: 'I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and

"The President and First Lady both filmed TV appearances in Burbank, California on Thursday - but billed taxpayers for two separate private flights to get there. Barack Obama took Air Force One to LAX, at a cost of more than $1million, so he could be on Jimmy Kimmel Live. But, rather than ride with him, Michelle Obama chartered a different, earlier plane for a slot on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, filmed in the same LA suburb as Kimmel's program. Scroll down for video . Obamas' day out: The president goofed around on-screen with Jimmy Kimmel, left, while the First Lady flew to California to give Ellen DeGeneres a hug (right) Busting moves on our dime: Michelle Obama took a different flight to her husband to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres show and dance to Uptown Funk . Tough at the top: Barack Obama took some time to read insulting tweets about himself on the show . Despite the closeness, the White House has insisted that the pair's schedules 'were not in sync', CNN reported. The Commander-in-Chief used his time on the airwaves to read out mean tweets about himself, while Mrs Obama busted dance moves alongside DeGeneres to the tune of Uptown Funk. Obama's episode of Kimmel has aired already, while the full DeGeneres show is due on Monday. White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz defended the arrangement to a group of reporters on Air Force One. No room for Michelle: The president took Air Force One for the TV appearance, at an estimated cost of more than $1million . Low-key: Obama took Marine One, background, from LAX to Burbank airport . He said: 'I believe on this occasion the schedules were not in sync to travel together... I'm not even sure they overlapped.' Obama's visit was also occasion for a host of obvious - and expensive - security measures. When the president took a helicopter from LAX to Burbank airport, he was accompanied by three military choppers. A team of snipers was also dispatched to Los Angles to guard the president, who took a 40-car motorcade from Burbank's airport to Kimmel's studio. Entourage: These black-clad security men were on the tarmac in Los Angeles as part of Obama's detail . The Obamas are not thought to have seen one other at all in California. The president flew on to Phoenix on Friday afternoon, while the First Lady returned to the White House Thursday. Air Force One costs more than $200,000 an hour to fly, meaning the tab for Obama's flight to Los Angeles will have passed the $1million mark by itself. The specifics of the First Lady's travel arrangements are not clear, though it is likely to have stacked tens of thousands of dollars on to the overall cost. It is not the first time the First Family has come under scrutiny for drafting multiple planes for very similar trips. A 2011 summer jaunt to Martha's Vineyard saw the President take Air Force One solo to the famous golfing spot. Michelle, Sasha and Malia followed in a separate jet just

"(CNN)A grand jury in Dallas County, Texas, has decided not to indict two officers in the fatal shooting of Jason Harrison, a schizophrenic man whose mother had called police for help getting him to the hospital. ""This particular case was reported out as a 'no bill,' from the grand jury,"" said Cristal Retana, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County District Attorney's Office. The grand jury's decision not to indict means Officers John Rogers and Andrew Hutchins won't face criminal prosecution in the case. But the officers are still facing a wrongful death lawsuit from Harrison's family. The incident occurred in June, and Harrison's family filed a lawsuit in November. The release of video from one of the officer's body cameras put the shooting back in the headlines last month. In it, Harrison's mother answers the door for police and nonchalantly walks outside. ""Oh, he's just off the chain,"" she says. ""You can hear him, talking about chopping up people."" It was a fairly routine occurrence for her to call the police for assistance with her son. An officer asks who she's talking about, and she replies, ""My son, bipolar, schizo,"" as Jason Harrison appears in the doorway behind her. He is twiddling a screwdriver between his fingers. One of the two officers called to the scene tells Harrison to drop the tool, a command the officers repeat at least four times as Harrison's mom screams, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" Within five seconds of that first command, the 39-year-old schizophrenic man is shot five times -- including twice in the back as he crashes headlong into the home's garage door, just a few feet from his mother. Video from one officer's body camera fades to black as Harrison's mother wails, ""Oh, they killed my son! Oh, they killed my son!"" The officers continue to tell Harrison to drop the weapon. The Harrison family's lawsuit against Rogers and Hutchins says they should have used nonlethal means of defusing the situation instead of choosing to engage ""in unlawful vicious attacks"" when they and the department were aware of Harrison's condition. The suit also claims the officers violated Harrison's civil rights. The officers, however, said in affidavits that they were forced to shoot an armed man who they deemed dangerous after he failed to comply with repeated orders to drop a screwdriver. CNN's Matthew Stucker and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

"Father Tony McSweeney, 68, watched as care home manager John Stingemore, his paedophile friend, fondled a teenager in the shower of Grafton Close Children’s Home . The 'Fat Vicar' who conducted Frank Bruno's wedding has been jailed for three years for abusing a boy at a children's home. Father Anthony McSweeney was locked up after the court rejected his claim that his 20st size meant he could not have molested boys as they sat on his lap. The 68-year-old, who officiated at the boxer's wedding to ex-wife Laura, watched as care home manager John Stingemore, his paedophile friend, fondled a teenager in the shower of Grafton Close Children’s Home in Hounslow, west London, between 1979 and 1981. The Catholic clergyman, once part-time chaplain at Norwich City FC, also collected vile child porn over ‘decades’ and was caught with a drawer crammed with sex toys by his cleaner, Southwark Crown Court heard. McSweeney was leading the congregation at St George’s Church in north Norwich when the claims against him emerged in 2013. He was originally charged with Stingemore, 72, but the care home manager died weeks before the trial was due to start. McSweeney’s 15-year-old victim remembered a ‘massive’ trainee priest who was a ‘right bulk’ visiting Grafton Close. Together with Stingemore, McSweeney forced the young teenager to expose himself to them and touched him under the pretence of making sure he was ‘clean’ four or five times. ‘This was joint enterprise by both men to use the victim for their own sexual gratification,’ said prosecutor Sarah Plaschkes QC. ‘On a number of occasions this defendant, together with the officer in charge of the home John Stingemore, would be present when the victim was in the bathroom. ‘Mr Stingemore would touch him by, in his words, lifting his balls and making him bend over.’ The men groomed the ‘vulnerable’ and ‘isolated’ boy by using the washing routine to ‘confuse the child’ and to hide their true motivation. Both pensioners were accused of targeting children while Stingemore, of Stonehouse Drive, St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, was in charge of the council-run home. The disgraced clergyman was found guilty of one count of indecent assault. Together with Stingemore (pictured), McSweeney forced the young teenager to expose himself to them and touched him under the pretence of making sure he was ‘clean’ four or five times . The morbidly obese Catholic priest argued he could not have molested boys as they sat on his lap because he was too fat to fit a teen on him . He was further found guilty of three charges of making indecent photographs of children after sickening images of sexual abuse were discovered on his Dell laptop dating between 2012 and 2013. He was cleared of three counts of indecent assault and one of taking an indecent photograph of a child relating to two boys who lived in the home he volunteered in. McSweeney sat open-mouthed as he was jailed for three years for his crimes. Judge McCreath explained the clergyman ’was prosecuted and convicted on a joint enterprise basis and

"Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10, low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers.

"Sergio Ramos was the first man Carlo Ancelotti embraced at the final whistle of Real Madrid’s dramatic Champions League win over Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Asked after the game when it was that he had decided to move the defender forward into midfield to cover the absence of Luka Modric, he replied: ‘The minute after I found out Modric was injured’. The two kept it between themselves and it worked on the night. Ramos is one of those players for whom the old Liverpool song about Jamie Carragher ‘We all dream of a team of Carraghers’ would be appropriate. He could play in every single position on the pitch. Sergio Ramos (left) celebrates with Javier Hernandez (centre) and Pepe after Real's winning goal . Ramos gees up the crowd during another all-action display at the Santiago Bernabeu for Real Madrid . It was a fiery Madrid derby on Wednesday night, but Ramos (left) once again proved his worth to Real . He often fools around in goal at Spain training. He started his Real Madrid career as a right back and won the European Championship there for his country. He has filled in at left-back, can play across the midfield and actually started his youth football career as striker. Had he been born British he would probably have grown up as a box-to-box midfielder. In Spain midfielders who have pace and can head and tackle often end up at centre-back and that is where he has settled. On Wednesday when his team needed him he was pitched into midfield and he let no-one down. And that’s the thing about Ramos. He very rarely lets anyone down. He is Real Madrid’s Carles Puyol – the all-action hero who rises above everyone else in in the penalty area in the Champions League final and heads in a corner that equalises Atletico Madrid’s 1-0 lead in injury time, allowing Real to play out extra-time and score three more to lift the trophy. Ramos heads away from his own penalty area, but spent most of the game marshalling the midfield . The makeshift midfielder holds off Atletico Madrid's Koke during a superb display in the middle of the park . And when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against Bayern Munich in 2010 in the Champions League semi-final when he sent his kick – at least as far as Twitter was concerned – into outer space, he has the guts to take another one in the European Championship final a couple of months later, and not only score but dink it Panenka style over the keeper’s dive. He has been mocked in the past for his Colemanballs comments that usually amount to declaring himself ‘happy with the three points’ after a cup game or ‘looking forward to the second leg’ after a league game, but even those who have in the past mocked him have come to admire him. It always seemed that even Jose Mourinho during his fall-out with Iker Casillas could never really properly fall out with Casillas' ally Ramos

He is accused of shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane at Wayne Community College on Monday morning before fleeing more than 500 miles south. He was arrested sleeping on Daytona Beach on Tuesday.

Brent Sass of Eureka was told he violated Rule 35 of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which prohibits cellphones and other two-way communication devices with wireless capability. The 35-year-old musher was running fifth place and a quarter of the way through the 979-mile contest when he was pulled off the course. Scroll down for video . Still smiling: Brent Sass of Eureka (right) was disqualified on Tuesday evening from the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race for carrying an iPod touch . Sass told the Alaska Dispatch News that he had no idea that he was doing anything wrong. 'I didn’t use [the iPod touch] and I had zero intent of using it for a Wi-Fi connection in checkpoints, but I was just completely clueless,' he said. 'I mean I gave my dad my cell phone because I knew you couldn’t have cell phones on this race specifically and I was just ignorant.' Sebastian Schnuelle, a Canadian dog musher and dog sled racer from Whitehorse, Yukon, who is not running in this year's Iditarod described Sass' disqualification as 'disappointment'.

'He was running a great team,' Schnuelle added. Sass, owner and founder of Wild and Free Mushing, has been racing and training huskies for 12 years. Originally from Excelsior, Minnesota, Sass moved to Alaska in 1998 to 'fulfill a lifelong dream' of living in the state. He attended the University of Alaska Fairbanks where he graduated with a major in geography and started mushing shortly after. Weather impacts: Iditarod mushers began their 1,000-mile trek across Alaska along a new route after poor trail conditions forced organizers to push the race's start north, bypassing a mountain range . Career high: Musher Timothy Hunt waits for his turn near the start area during the Iditarod . Since his first race in 2006, Sass has placed in over 20 races, including several first place finishes. Last month he won 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race. The Iditarod began Monday in Fairbanks and will finish in Nome. Aliy Zirkle of Two Rivers was in the lead 227 miles into the race Tuesday at the Tanana checkpoint, where Sass is currently resting.

"Rafa Benitez is what he is; an excellent cup manager. He proved this yet again on Thursday, when his Napoli side blitzed past Europa League favourites Wolfsburg by four goals to one on the Germans' home turf. But despite managing some of the continent's most established clubs since leaving Valencia just over a decade ago - Liverpool, Inter, Chelsea (albeit on an interim basis) and Napoli - he has amassed a grand total of zero league titles. Benitez famously guided Liverpool to the Champions League in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes . Benitez remains popular at Anfield, but when he left there were few regrets over his departure . Donovan Chandler is a Liverpool fan writer on 90min.com . At Anfield, we will be eternally grateful for the Champions League trophy he delivered in 2005, in spite of possessing what was, on paper at least, our worst accumulation of players in recent history. Djimi Traore, Antonio Nunez, Milan Baros and Igor Biscan - cult hero that he was - were all part of that unfathomably successful squad. All four were dispensed of either that summer or the one that followed. Two years after Instanbul, Benitez was (almost) at it again with a side that better resembled the one he would have wanted, though it wasn't quite good enough to overcome an improved AC Milan side on this occasion. For all the Spaniard's successes, he also brought in the hapless Djimi Traore and Czech forward Milan Baros . And although we ran Manchester United a close second two seasons after that, we actually ended up further away from the Premier League title than we had been in a number of years during his final campaign (2009-10) - a failure that signalled the end to an Anfield tenure that also yielded our last FA Cup. In between, he lumbered us with the Josemi's, Albert Riera's and Phillipp Degen's of this world; none of us had many regrets over his departure - except, of course, that it was the catalyst for our introduction to Roy Hodgson. Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006 on penalties against West Ham . With Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard playing well together, Benitez got close to the title, but never won it . And for all his moments, I fully believe we are on the right track again under Brendan Rodgers, even if we can't quite clutch that final Champions League spot this season - or miss out on the FA Cup. That's why, if Rafa returns to England again in the summer - as is being speculated due to Napoli's Serie A shortcomings this season - it will receive little more than a shrug from large sections of the Kop. His league failings mean he is unlikely to be sworn in at any of our top-four rivals, unless Manchester City need someone to keep the seat warm for their dream conquest Pep Guardiola. Liverpool's failure in the Premier League means that Benitez will always be remembered as a cup specialist . As far as my

"The Brisbane apartment where Marcus Volke murdered his transgender wife, dismembered her body and cooked her remains is now on the rental market. Volke killed his Indonesian wife and sex worker, Mayang Prasetyo, in October last year in their apartment on Commercial Road in Teneriffe in Brisbane's inner-city. The brutal crime ended with Volke - who was a male escort - taking his own life in a nearby industrial bin. Scroll down for video . This eerie photo features the stove top used by Marcus Volke to boil the remains of Mayang Prasetyo's body . The couple met Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome while they were both working as escorts in 2009 . The property was listed online in late February as a ‘fully furnished apartment’ looking to fetch $500 a week for rent. The advertisement has since been removed however it is still believed to be available upon private inquiry. Four other apartments in the complex are currently being advertised. Eerie photos of the apartment feature a shot of the stove Mr Volke used to boil the remains of his deceased partner. Properties like Volke’s that have an unsavoury past are more commonly referred to as ‘stigmatised properties’. The apartment on Commercial Road in Teneriffe in Brisbane's inner-city has four other apartments on the market . Queensland Police removed a toxic-labelled container following the discovery of Ms Prasetyo's body parts found boiling in chemicals in a Brisbane apartment . If these walls could talk: As the apartment was the site of a brutal murder it is classed as a stigmatised property . Properties are considered stigmatised if a murder, suicide, death from natural causes, violent crime or drug related offence took place on the property. It can even be considered stigmatised if the previous owners believed the house was haunted. While real estate agents are not obligated to advertise events that have occurred in the property, they must disclose the information to interested parties. Stigmatised: The real estate agent was asking for around $500 for the 'fully furnished' apartment . This isn’t the first property in recent times to come on the market with a dark past. In Sydney’s Hyde Park, the luxurious apartment where Simon Gittany murdered his fiancé Lisa Harnam failed to sell despite expectations it would be picked up for more than $2 million dollars. Emergency services remove her body from the DoubleOne 3 Apartments in Commercial Road . The remains of Ms Prasetyo were found cooking inside a Teneriffe apartment - in Brisbane's inner-city - in Ocrober of last year. Volke fled the scene when police showed up at the couple's home and was later found with his throat slashed and a knife in an industrial bin nearby.

Magistrate Michael Quinn reminded him he had a number of similar convictions on his criminal record, but Mr Philp said these were a long time ago and he wanted to 'change things.'

"Hong Kong (CNN)Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media. The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.

"(CNN)In an audio message purportedly from an ISIS spokesman, the group announced that a pledge of allegiance from Nigerian-based Boko Haram has been accepted by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The 28-minute message, which cannot be independently authenticated by CNN, was posted online by ISIS supporters. The message says that the caliphate, or Islamic State, has expanded to western Africa and congratulated ""our jihadi brothers"" there. The spokesman, Abu Mohammed al Adnani, encourages people to join fighters in Africa if they cannot make it to Iraq or Syria. Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, announced in an audio message last week that the Islamist terror group was going to ally with ISIS. Jacob Zenn, a terror expert who lives in Nigeria, told CNN on Saturday the alliance would make sense for both groups. ""Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands,"" Zenn said. ""It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS's biggest affiliate. ""ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate."" Boko Haram, whose name translates as ""Western education is sin,"" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. What Boko Haram's pledge of allegiance to ISIS means .

"Jenson Button is convinced ailing McLaren will one day challenge the might of Mercedes despite the two teams currently at opposite ends of the pace spectrum at present. McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda suffered abject humiliation in the season-opening grand prix in Australia earlier this month. The team were already without the services of big-name acquisition Fernando Alonso after the Spaniard sustained concussion in a testing accident in Barcelona. Come the race, reserve Kevin Magnussen failed to even make it to the start line due to a power-unit issue that forced the young Dane to pull over on the formation lap. Jenson Button waves to the crowd before the first race of the season in Australia . McLaren were well of the pace in Melbourne... Button finished 11th, two laps behind winner Lewis Hamilton . At least Button saw the chequered flag, describing it at the time as 'a small victory', albeit finishing two laps down on race-winner Lewis Hamilton in 11th and last place. Despite McLaren's seemingly hopeless position heading into Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix, a positive Button can see hope on the horizon. 'We're a hell of a long way behind, but I feel we have something we can mould into something very special in the future, which is very exciting,' said Button. 'Being 1.5 seconds off the pace and knowing you've peaked with your package, that's got to hurt. 'Whereas at least we have a glimmer of hope we can possibly challenge Mercedes one day.' Asked as to the reasoning behind his belief, Button replied: 'The direction with the car in terms of aerodynamics, but also with how aggressive this engine is, which is why we're having so many issues. 'In many ways - it's probably wrong for me to say - it's probably more like a Mercedes than it is the other two manufacturers (Ferrari and Renault) in terms of design, aggressiveness and packaging. Lewis Hamilton sprays champagne from the podium after winning the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton led team-mate Nico Rosberg home in Melbourne as Mercedes dominated the opening race of 2015 . 'It's just going to take a little bit of time, but if we didn't have that hope you wouldn't see the strong effort by the whole team. 'They're not heading to races because they're paid to, they're doing so because they're passionate about racing. They're looking forward to the future as much as I am.' The one bonus for McLaren this weekend is Alonso is poised to return, pending a final medical check by the FIA at the Sepang International Circuit on Thursday. Racing director Eric Boullier, for one, is happy to have the Spaniard back on board as he said: 'I'm pleased to see Fernando back in the car. 'He's raring to go, and I know he's been working hard behind the scenes to prepare himself for this weekend.' Fernando Alonso is poised to return to the McLaren cockpit providing he passes an FIA medical on Thursday .

"These pictures show the moment a weasel bit off more than it could chew when it made the unwise decision to attack a heron. The aggressive mammal was seen leaping up and biting the large bird's beak, with the move quickly backfiring for the weasel who did not live to tell the tale. After deciding enough was enough, the heron scooped up the critter in its mouth and flew to a nearby lake to drown it, dipping the weasel underwater twice to make sure it was dead. Clinging on: This aggressive weasel was drowned by a heron after the mammal annoyed the bird by attacking it and biting its large beak . Pick on someone your own size: The weasel was pictured biting the heron's beak as it bit off more than it could chew by taking on the large bird . Going down: The annoyed heron decided enough was enough, picking up the weasel in its beak and flying to a nearby lake to drown it . Dunk: The large bird plunged the mammal into the water twice, holding it underneath the surface until it had drowned . The photographs, taken by bird watcher Jonathan Forgham, show nature at its most brutal as the heron gobbled down the weasel in one gulp. Mr Forgham was leaving Elmley Nature Reserve on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, after spending three hours photographing owls when he spotted the weasel attacking the heron. He said: 'I got my car closer and could see the weasel attacking the bird. At that point the heron wasn't trying to eat it, it was just trying to get rid of it. But the weasel attacked its beak again and the heron picked it up and flew of to the pond. 'I drove the car round there in time to see the heron try to drown the weasel. It lifted it out of the water and then dunked it again to make sure it was dead. 'When the weasel was quite motionless the heron swallowed it.

"Eight animals are dead, including at least one alligator that once belonged to Michael Jackson, after a fire last week destroyed two enclosures at a zoological park in Oklahoma. Authorities suspect an arsonist is to blame for the March 26 fire that left seven alligators and a crocodile 'boiled to death' at the Garold Wayne Interactive Zoological Park, News OK reports. The fire was set in the early morning hours that March day and Joe Schreibvogel, the founder of the zoo, said not only did the alleged criminal set the fire, but also stole a large amount of equipment Schreibvogel used to record his independently produced television show, JoeExotic TV. Alligators: At least one of Michael Jackson's alligators (photographed) from his Neverland Ranch died ina fire at the Garold Wayne Interactive Zoological Park in Oklahoma . Escaped: Eight animals died in the fire that destroyed two reptiles enclosures and one alligator reportedly escaped . 'This was personal,' he told News OK. 'They targeted the studio to shut me up. They wanted to get me off the air...or else they would’ve targeted something else [in the Park].' In addition to destroying the two reptile enclosures, the fire also destroyed a video production studio. Garvin County Sheriff Larry Rhodes told KJRH that the fire was arson and most likely an attempt to cover up a burglary or theft. Only one alligator escaped the blaze. KJRH reports that one alligator that reportedly belonged to the self-proclaimed King of Pop suffered severe smoke inhalation but is in recovery. Destroyed: Not only did the alleged criminal set the fire, but also stole a large amount of equipment Joe Schreibvogel, the founder of the zoo, used to record his independently produced television show, JoeExotic TV . Arson: Officials say an arson investigator has not officially declared the incident a case of arson, but has ruled out other likely causes like electrical issues and lightning from recent storms in the area . All Times: Schreibvogel said that, despite the fire, the park will remain open but armed security guards will be on duty at all times . Schreibvogel told News OK he is often targeted by animal rights groups and extremists, calling them 'animal terroristst.' He said it is an 'ongoing pattern,' noting that he has received threats before. 'It is more of disgust,' He told KJRH of his feelings toward the incident. 'If somebody has an issue with the zoo or an issue with me personally then take it up with me. 'These animals didn't deserved to be burned to death.' Rhodes told News OK that an arson investigator has not officially declared the incident a case of arson, but has ruled out other likely causes like electrical issues and lightning from recent storms in the area. King of Pop: After the worldwide mega-star died in 2009, the animals that made up his massive menagerie were spread across the U.S. to animals preserves, sanctuaries, and animal enthusiasts . No one has been arrested or charged in the case. Schreibvogel, who reportedly filed for bankruptcy in 2013, said repairs

"If Wigan Athletic are to be relegated from the Sky Bet Championship, then their new manager Gary Caldwell would want to see them go down kicking and screaming. Martyn Waghorn took that a little too literally against Millwall, his red card for a senseless kick at Dan Harding punished by a Lions side determined to avoid a similar fate. When Waghorn, who played for Millwall on loan from Leicester in 2013, lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour, it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points. And they were duly delivered when Jimmy Abdou headed home Harding’s cross with 15 minutes remaining, sending a febrile Den into raptures. Millwall team-mates rush to congratulate substitute Magaye Gueye after he scored their second goal . Lions No 1 David Forde celebrates after Jimmy Abdou came on to break the deadlock with a rare strike . Martyn Waghorn was one of three players sent off - two for Wigan and one for Millwall in the fiesty clash . Millwall: Forde (c); Cummings, Nelson, Beevers, Harding; Upson, Abdou, Williams (Bailey 42), Martin (Gueye 68); O’Brien (Woolford 84), Gregory . Substitutes not used: Archer (GK); Cowan-Hall, Fuller, Taylor-Fletcher . Scorers: Abdou 75; Gueye 90+3 . Booked: Gregory, Martin, Bailey, Beevers . Sent off: Upson . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Pennant (Chow 81), Perch (c), Kvist (Ojo 90+1), Kim Bo-Kyung, McLean; Fortune (Waghorn 53) Substitutes not used: Al Habsi (GK); McCann, Barnett, Murphy . Booked: Bong, Bo-Kyung . Sent off: Waghorn, Pearson . Referee: Stephen Martin (Staffordshire) In his six seasons at the club, that was only Abdou’s seventh goal. What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn’t a misprint. There was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O’Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall’s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction. The game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm. And a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson. Millwall’s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night. The plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points. Harris had described this match as a ‘Cup Final’ and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell’s men. Wigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall .

'I am completely focused on the last 10 games, because they could be my last here.' Liverpool are also thought to be admirers of the youngster, who also visited the Nou Camp to watch Barcelona play earlier this season. However, Dybala insists he was only there for the football, and not to discuss a potential transfer. He added: 'I went to Camp Nou merely as a spectator. There were a lot of great players out on the pitch, it was a great game and it helped me because I learned a lot from watching it.'

"(CNN)Back in 2010 Britain's politicians broke new ground. They were long used to haranguing each other in the UK's rowdy House of Commons -- but they'd never had American style pre-election head-to-head debates. It is necessary and long-established political fare in the U.S. -- but over here in the UK, it was novel. It seemed to go well -- political points were scored, and polls were commissioned looking for advantages gained or lost. It was a drama of sorts, even though no knock-out punches were landed. Prime Minister David Cameron and his Conservative party won the election, but not by enough to go into government alone. For the past five years he's been governing in coalition with the UK's third party, the Liberal Democrats. And their leader, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, has mostly backed Cameron in Parliamentary debates against the opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband. Britain's broadcasters, keen to channel lively politics onto prime time TV and boost ratings, have been working the corridors of power themselves over the past year to try to nail down a repeat -- or two -- of the 2010 knockabout. What's at stake isn't just the proposed debates ahead of May's general election -- but the enshrining of such debates permanently into Britain's political architecture -- just like in the U.S. But while Cameron and Miliband have hired former White House election advisers to edge them in to the lead, no one can agree on what form a debate should take, how many there should be, or even who should be invited. Cameron has insisted on just one debate involving the leaders of seven leading UK parties -- giving equal airtime to the Greens, the Scottish Nationalists and the upstart rightwing UK Independence Party (UKIP), among others. But Miliband's Labour party is holding out for at least one head-to-head debate with Cameron. No one seems to be budging but both of the UK's largest parties could use the bump in the polls such a debate might bring. Part of the problem is the British electorate, which has changed since 2010, boosting the fortunes of some of the country's former political outliers. The rightwing UKIP, which has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union, has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of Cameron's Conservatives. In Scotland, the September independence referendum (which narrowly failed) so reinvigorated the Scottish National Party that they could hit what is usually a key Labour stronghold, undermining Miliband's bid for power. All of this has made the whole process of nailing down precisely who will be allowed in the debate that much more tortuous. For the big leaders who drive that conversation, it is about how each outlier can help them -- and hinder their rivals. It once looked like it would become as much of a British institution as rain, or fish and chips, but now the election debate seems in danger of not happening at all. On the upside, you can still tune in to House of Commons TV most days

"Manchester United defender Chris Smalling took a trip down memory lane as the 25-year-old went back to his old judo club. Photos of the visit, during which he presented some members with replica United jerseys, were posted on the International Judo Federation's official Twitter account alongside a flashback picture of Smalling as a youngster. The England international, who only made the decision to join the social networking site on Friday, excelled at the martial art as a teen and was even named national champion for his age group, before football took precedence at 15. The International Judo Federation shares pictures of Chris Smalling taking the time to visit his old club . Smalling was a gifted martial artist and was at one stage named national judo champion for his age group . The Manchester United defender presents some replica jerseys to some of the members of the club . Smalling began his footballing career with minnows Maidstone United in Kent, before a string of impressive performances saw him snapped up by then Premier League side Fulham in 2008. After only a handful appearances for the Cottagers, his talent was clear and Smalling signed for Manchester United one year later. It has been a remarkable rise for the former Chatham Grammar School student, who if football had not worked out, was set to study Business Management at Loughborough University, having gained a decent set of A-Levels. Smalling will be hoping to make manager Louis van Gaal's starting line up for the crunch clash with local rivals Manchester City this weekend, as United aim to finish the league campaign in the top-four.

"They have eluded explorers, hunters and scientists who have been searching the Himalayan mountains for the mysterious yeti for over a century. Now it seems we are no closer to knowing what creature lies behind the mysterious sightings and footprints that have led to the legend of the Abominable Snowman. A key piece of evidence that suggested many of the sightings were due to an unknown type of bear living in the Himalaya has now been ruled out. This footprint taken by British explorer Eric Shipton in 1954 is regarded as one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of a yeti and new research on hair samples shows that the mystery is far from being solved . Biologists used DNA analysis to examine claims that hair samples attributed to yetis appeared to belong to a scientifically undiscovered species of bear. Instead they have found that the DNA in the hair samples has degraded making it impossible to attribute them to any species of bear. The . first accounts of Yetis emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists . who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas. They . depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and . carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound. The . term Abominable Snowman was developed in 1921 following a book by . Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury called Mount Everest The . Reconnaissance. Popular . interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists . began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the Yeti. They reported seeing strange markings in the snow. The . Daily Mail led a trip called the the Snowman Expedition in 1954 to . Everest. During the trip mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson . photographed ancient paintings of Yetis and large footprints in the . snow. A number of hair . samples were also found that were believed to have come from a Yeti . scalp. British . mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when . scaling Annapurna in 1970. He said that while searching for a campsite . he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a Yeti's call. That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. The researchers conclude, however, that from the colour and shape of the hair samples, they were likely to have come from common Himalayan brown bears rather than an unknown species of bear. This means that the identity of the species behind yeti sightings is still a mystery. Dr Eliécer Gutiérrez, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian Institution, said one of the hair samples had apparently come from a bear that had been shot by hunters. He said: 'We have concluded that there is no reason to believe that the two samples came from anything other than Brown Bears. 'What strikes us as odd is that an “experienced hunter”, who was very familiar with the Brown Bear, could mistake the animal that he had shot for anything other than a bear

"Arsene Wenger wants Cesc Fabregas to be shown the ‘respect he deserves’ when he returns to the Emirates Stadium in the blue of Chelsea on Sunday. The problem with that is a decent chunk of Arsenal’s supporters feel he doesn’t deserve much. That became obvious on Thursday, when one prominent fan called for the removal of a Fabregas banner from the Ken Friar Bridge. Cesc Fabregas returns to Arsenal on Sunday and Arsene Wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception . Wenger wants 'respect' for the club's former players and counts Fabregas as a man who deserves that . Gunners fans offer their good luck to Fabregas in 2011, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time . Extreme, perhaps, but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where Fabregas built his career, not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from Barcelona to Chelsea are still as clear as mud. Any clarity, it seems, will have to wait. Wenger was at his cryptic best on Thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re-sign the player, saying: ‘We will have to discuss that one day. With all the terms.’ When pressed on whether it was his decision, he added: ‘It’s not as clean as that. I cannot speak to you about that now because that will not help us to win on Sunday.’ At that point it was suggested to Wenger that Fabregas chose not to come back and Wenger said: ‘I don’t know, I don’t know.’ The Frenchman has previously claimed that by the time he knew Fabregas was available, a deal with Chelsea was virtually concluded — comments which jarred a little with the Spaniard’s statement last summer that Arsenal ‘decided not to take’ their option. Whatever, it would be ambitious for Fabregas to expect an overwhelmingly positive reception on Sunday. The midfielder set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Certainly, there was already a degree of disappointment within the club about how their relationship with the player ended when he left in 2011. But Wenger said: ‘I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday, (I want him) to be respected like he deserves.’ Wenger added: ‘The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc’s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here.’ When he returns, it will be as a key part of the champions-elect and under a manager in Jose Mourinho who has won seven and drawn five of his 12 meetings with Wenger. That clash, in itself, is a fascinating sub-plot to this fixture between the top and second-placed teams in the Barclays Premier League. Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 .

"Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has defended the company's ridiculed 'Race Together' campaign as 'very genuine'. The campaign is encouraging workers to write 'Race Together' on cups and strike up conversations about race as they serve customers their coffee. The company is also preparing a guide with questions to pose, such as: 'How have your racial views evolved from those of your parents?' After the campaign was announced earlier this week, the coffee chain was slammed on social media and was accused of using racial tensions to boost its bottom line. But during Starbucks' annual shareholders meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, Schultz defended the campaign and said the company is simply trying to use its massive reach for good. Defense: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told Good Morning America, pictured, that he is simply trying to use the company's reach for good with its new 'Race Together' campaign . 'Some in the media will criticize Starbucks for having a political agenda,' he said. 'Our intentions are pure.' Speaking on CBS This Morning on Thursday, he added: 'This is a highly charged, highly emotional issue, we understand that. 'We've tried to be very thoughtful, very genuine, very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores, potentially, we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference.' He said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company's workers can 'elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day', he will be satisfied. After the campaign was announced, Twitter ruthlessly mocked Starbucks. One user tweeted: 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train.' Standing firm: He also addressed the massive social media backlash during the company's annual shareholder's meeting in Seattle on Wednesday (pictured), saying: 'Our intentions are pure' Support: Schultz was joined on stage at the annual meeting by rapper Common, who also spoke about the importance of engaging with people from different backgrounds in support of the campaign . Controversial: The new campaign encourages workers to write 'Race Together' on customer's cups and to strike up conversations about race. Pictured, customer Matt Ullman shows off one of the new stickers . Another added: '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life ""white man's burden"" crisis.' An executive on Starbucks' communications team, Corey duBrowa, even blocked people on Twitter before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign. DuBrowa later said in a post on Medium that he felt he was being 'personally attacked in a cascade of negativity' and that he had gotten overwhelmed, but later reactivated the account. When Good Morning America asked Schultz about some of the scathing criticism on Thursday, Schultz responded: 'Well, you know what I say to that - no good deed goes unpunished.'

"After two drama-filled defeats in a week to local rivals Aston Villa, victory over Stoke, the club he managed for seven years before they judged his work there to be done, was a welcome tonic for Tony Pulis. A fourth consecutive clean sheet at home and a first-half goal from Brown Ideye takes West Bromwich Albion to 13th and 11 points from the drop zone. When Pulis, the engineer of Crystal Palace’s great escape last season, took over in January they hovered just one point above the bottom three, offering little to inspire optimism among their fans. Now their place in the top tier looks secure. Stoke were aiming at a fourth win in a row for the first time since 2011 but Pulis halted their progress. He said: ‘It doesn’t mean any more to win over Stoke, I had a wonderful journey there and left them in a sound financial and good position and did wonderful things. Today was about West Brom getting the points.’ Brown Ideye scores the opening goal during the match between West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City . Ideye's opener was the only goal of the game as West Bromwich Albion beat Stoke at the Hawthorns . Pulis praised the contribution made by Darren Fletcher, who arrived at The Hawthorns on a free transfer on January deadline day after a lengthy struggle with ulcerative colitis in his later years at Manchester United. ‘He’s been a fantastic signing,’ said Pulis. ‘A tremendous lad. His enthusiasm and energy levels are brilliant. I don’t know what illness it was but he looks as sprightly as any 20-year-old. I thought he and James Morrison [who partners Fletcher for Scotland] dominated the midfield.’ There were a few controversial moments, such as referee Michael Oliver’s decision to wave away what seemed a blatant penalty for Geoff Cameron’s hefty second-half challenge on Craig Dawson in the box. Oliver, who was praised for his officiating of Manchester United’s FA Cup defeat by Arsenal on Monday, is likely to get attention for different reasons after waving away penalty appeals, to Pulis’s obvious fury. ‘Michael will look at that again and be very disappointed, that’s a blatant a penalty as I’ve seen in a long time,’ he said. A beautiful cross into the box from Craig Gardner led to the goal in the 19th minute. It was expertly headed in at the far post by a stooping Ideye, who found it far too easy to escape the attentions of Phil Bardsley.

"Families crossing the Channel by Eurotunnel or ferry face Easter misery after ministers insisted on introducing new exit checks during one of the busiest getaways of the year. Queues of up to five miles and lengthy delays are predicted when the new regime starts on April 8. Under the new rules, the passport of every passenger in a car or coach will have to be individually scanned. Ministers insist that knowing who is leaving the country is vital for counting the number of immigrants in Britain and fighting crime and terrorism. Nightmare journeys: P&O Ferries has claimed new border control rules will cause huge delays leaving the country with 'coachloads of little old ladies bearing the brunt' But even though no checks have taken place over the past 17 years, the Home Office decided the best date to reinstate them should be on the second week in April – when vast numbers of Britons head to the continent during the Easter school break. Ferry companies warn that holidaymakers will be held in queues on the A20 in Kent, blocking the route between Dover and Folkestone during one of the busiest times of year. MPs on the home affairs select committee were sent a letter from the UK Chamber of Shipping claiming trials had shown that queues of at least 650 vehicles would form on busy days. Tim Reardon, the chamber’s policy director, said: ‘The model showed that, with tourist and freight check-in transactions extended by exit checks, the queue of traffic heading for the port of Dover would extend at least 8km, blocking the A20 almost as far as Folkestone.’ Eurotunnel calculates the new system will quadruple the time taken to get vehicles onto shuttle trains. Buses with 30 or more passengers on board will take even longer. Checking a car on to a cross-Channel train takes 15 seconds at the moment. But passport checks on up to five passengers will stretch that closer to two minutes, adding to delays. Eurotunnel public affairs director John Keefe said: ‘You only have to multiply the number of people in each vehicle – five six or seven in a car or 30 or more in a coach – to see how this will play out. Protective measures: The checks start on April 8 and Eurotunnel and ferry companies will be checking the passports of all those leaving the country to tighten national security . ‘That increases the risk of congestion and delays. That’s the risk we are trying to mitigate. But the risks are significant.’ Advice: Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told the Today programme that people should set out on their journeys earlier to avoid delays . Ministers were last night under pressure from MPs to make exceptions to the rules, such as large coach parties. Interviewed on BBC Radio Four’s Today programme yesterday, immigration minister James Brokenshire twice hesitated before saying passengers should set out early on their journeys. Quizzed a third time, he said: ‘On busy days I think it is advisable for anyone to set out earlier to ensure that they are

"(CNN)A sexual harassment complaint has been filed against New Zealand Prime Minister John Key after a waitress complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail at an Auckland cafe. CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that the complaint was filed Thursday morning by Graham McCready, an accountant described in the New Zealand press as a ""serial litigant,"" who has previously launched private prosecutions against Key. McCready's complaint claimed that Key had breached a section of the country's Human Rights Act relating to sexual harassment, TVNZ reported. It reported that he was seeking considerable compensation for the waitress, 26-year-old Amanda Bailey, and ""if she does not want it I ask for the money be given to Women's Refuge."" Key publicly apologized to Bailey, a waitress at his local cafe, for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail, after she complained about his behavior in a blog post. The post, published on New Zealand political website The Daily Blog, says that the odd behavior began during last year's election season. It was ""hardly an acceptable form of greeting,"" Bailey wrote. She wrote that while she didn't directly make her objections clear verbally, her body language ""screamed 'I don't like that.'"" ""As he approached me, he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary, suspense sound effects, like the music from the movie 'Jaws',"" read the post. ""As he towered overhead I slunk down, cringing, whilst (Key's wife) Bronagh told him to 'Leave the poor girl alone.'"" The behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions, the post states. Eventually the cafe's manager made it clear to Key that his actions were unwelcome. Key, who regularly visits the Auckland cafe with his wife, told reporters that his behavior was in the context of ""a bit of banter,"" but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense. The blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own JK 2012 Pinot Noir wine by way of apology. ""We have lots of fun and games there, there's always lots of practical jokes and things. It's a very warm and friendly relationship,"" he told reporters in Los Angeles en route to ANZAC day commemorations in Gallipoli, Turkey. ""But if you look at it now, no. When I realized she took offense by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologized and said I was terribly sorry."" Politicians and public figures also rounded on Key, with Green MP Metiria Turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate. ""A lot of New Zealanders know what it's like to feel as if you're not taken seriously in a job. As politicians, our job is to make people feel safe at work, not bullied,"" New Zealand media reported her as saying. ""It's a sign of how out of touch John Key has become when he can't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is, and when people are not

"New Delhi, India (CNN)Police have arrested four employees of a popular Indian ethnic-wear chain after a minister spotted a security camera overlooking the changing room of one of its stores. Federal education minister Smriti Irani was visiting a FabIndia outlet in the tourist resort state of Goa on Friday when she discovered a surveillance camera pointed at the changing room, police said. Four employees of the store have been arrested, but its manager -- herself a woman -- was still at large Saturday, said Goa police superintendent Kartik Kashyap. State authorities launched their investigation right after Irani levied her accusation. They found an overhead camera that the minister had spotted and determined that it was indeed able to take photos of customers using the store's changing room, according to Kashyap. After the incident, authorities sealed off the store and summoned six top officials from FabIndia, he said. The arrested staff have been charged with voyeurism and breach of privacy, according to the police. If convicted, they could spend up to three years in jail, Kashyap said. Officials from FabIndia -- which sells ethnic garments, fabrics and other products -- are heading to Goa to work with investigators, according to the company. ""FabIndia is deeply concerned and shocked at this allegation,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are in the process of investigating this internally and will be cooperating fully with the police.""

"Human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time, according to scientists. Researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in China that has introduced DNA changes to reproductive cells. Although the scientific paper is yet to be published, the scientific world is abuzz with rumours that the work has been carried out. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren. Human embryos, like the one above, may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques . They say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications. They have described it as 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable'. However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. A gene editing technique known as CRISPR can search through DNA and replace specific genes or remove them. Under proposals put forward by Dr Luhan Yang, human ovarian tissue from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer could be used to obtain immature egg cells. These could then be encouraged to grow in the laboratory before using CRISPR to remove the genetic fault causing the cancer. The defective BRAC1 gene, for example, results in inherited breast and ovarian cancer. By repairing this gene, the resulting egg could be made healthy. Researchers at the moment say this should only be used for scientific research but it opens up the possibility of using edited eggs to create human embryos that have had heritable diseases removed. According to a report by the National Post, Professor George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, says a paper outlining the technology is due to be published. He said: 'There is a paper from China. I don't think it's been accepted yet, but I think it will be at some point.' His comments match those made by several leading scientists working with non-reproductive stem cells who have raised concerns over the new technology. Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases. Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations. Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China. A number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos. Germ line genetic editing alters the DNA in sperm and egg cells - meaning the changes can be passed on . Xingxu Huang, from Shanghai Tech University in China has been seeking permission to perform the technique on

"Three children from a remote mountain village in China travel on horseback for three hours a day in order to attend their nearest school. The eight-year-olds endure the 16km round trip every day accompanied by their elderly grandparents - who walk for six hours a day to ensure their grandchildren get the education they themselves were denied. The grandparents of Huang Shijun, Huang Chenbin and Huang Lingyan take the children from their remote home in Mudong village to school every day on horseback, leading the animals along the muddy, rocky and winding track 1,300m above sea level. The grandparents take it in turns to lead the horses along the trail, which is 1,300 metres above sea level . The journey can be dangerous, particularly when it is icy - then the children have to stay at home . The children, all from the Yao ethnic minority group, are all 'left-behind children' - which means their parents have left them in the care of their grandparents while they look for work in towns and cities miles from their village homes. The People's Daily Online reports the youngsters have ridden the horses along the muddy and often dangerous road to school for the last three years. All three youngsters are in Grade One at Liuli elementary school. Huang Shijun, Huang Chenbin and Huang Lingyan are all aged just eight - and travel 16km a day to school . Huang Lingyan (left) said she loves going to school by horse - and all her friends are jealous of her transport . The muddy road from Mudong to Liuli village was only built in 2010, supported by government grants and cannot carry cars. The school has just one teacher, who has worked there alone for five years, teaching two classes with 19 students in total. Huang Fengjun, Huang Chenbin's 60-year-old grandfather, has been using a horse to carry his grandson to school since Huang Chenbin started preschool three years ago. He said the three families had three horses and use them to carry their children to school. During busy seasons for farmers one elderly person takes all three children to school on behalf of the three families. The children often get soaked through on their daily excursions as they cannot carry umbrellas when it rains . After arriving at school, the horses are tied in front of the school's field to graze and the elderly people return to their village. At 3pm the grandparents walk back to the school to take the children home. According to Huang Fengjun, their horses are very docile and do not run around or kick people. But at the beginning of March one horse ran into the mountains and disappeared. Now the three children have to share two horses to get to school. The children often get soaked through on their daily excursions as they cannot carry umbrellas when it rains. Huang Fengjun said: 'Rain will wet their clothes and shoes, so we use plastic sheets to cover the kids and then take them slowly on the horses to school.' But

"Deceased: Jason Kortz has been identified as the Navy SEAL who fell to his death during a training exercise in Southern California . Navy officials say a SEAL killed when his parachute malfunctioned during training in Southern California was a 29-year-old Colorado man who completed basic training to become a SEAL last year. Naval Special Warfare Group One said Thursday that Jason Kortz of Highlands Ranch, Colorado, died from injuries sustained during the accident in Perris on Wednesday. The Navy is investigating why the parachute malfunctioned. It released no further details. Naval Special Warfare Group One is the Coronado-based SEALs group to which the sailor was assigned. Kortz enlisted in the Navy in 2012 and completed basic training for the SEALs last year in Coronado. He is survived by his wife, parents and brother. KABC-TV captured an aerial shot of the commando's body on the ground covered by an American flag with first responders gathered around. Paramedics apparently received a report around 9am on Wednesday that there was a 'skydiver down' at a grassy location outside of Perris in Riverside County. The sailor died of injuries sustained in the daytime parachute jump but no other details were immediately available. Kortz was identified by officials as a West Coast-based member of the Naval Special Warfare Group ONE. All Navy SEALS are required to take parachute jump course during their qualification training.

"Real Madrid are hoping that a win against Levante on Sunday night will help them make peace with their fans, who have turned on the team after a recent poor run of form. Carlo Ancelotti's men have come under fierce criticism after squandering their lead at the top of La Liga, with Marca's front page on Sunday referring to the situation as a 'pressure cooker'. Levante are the visitors to the Bernabeu, in what AS have described as a 'trial run' for next week's El Clasico. The match at the Nou Camp on March 22 will go a long way to deciding this season's La Liga champions, and Ancelotti will be desperate to reclaim Madrid's spot at the top of the table. The front page of Marca leads with the headline, 'Pressure Cooker' ahead of Real Madrid's game on Sunday . Madrid face Levante at the Bernabeu on Sunday night, while Barcelona beat Eibar 2-0 on Saturday . There will be changes in the starting line-up for the Levante clash, the Spanish papers claim, with Keylor Navas expected to get the nod ahead of Iker Casillas. The Spanish veteran made a number of high-profile mistakes against Schalke in the Champions League last week. Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric are also expected to start, in order to get themselves ready for El Clasico. Marca carry a quote from Madrid boss Ancelotti, who has stated that his team are 'hurt, but won't let our heads drop'. Barcelona continued their good form on Saturday, comfortably beating Eibar 2-0. The win means that they have extended their lead at the top to four points - and it is up to Madrid to close the gap with victory on Sunday. In Italy, Juventus won 1-0 against Palermo, and are now gearing up for their Champions League game midweek . Morata scored the winning goal, and Tuttosport's headline (left) reads: 'Borussia, we're coming' Mundo Deportivo's front page hails the 'solid leaders', who came through the game ahead of a decisive week against Manchester City and then Real Madrid. They write that Lionel Messi was once again decisive, scoring both of his side's goals, one from the penalty spot and the other a 'great header'. Messi has taken his tally to 32 league goals for the season, overtaking rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the process. In Italy, much of the focus is on Juventus ahead of their Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund. Massimiliano Allegri's side beat Palermo 1-0 to 'send a message to Borussia', who they beat 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 game a fortnight ago. Elsewhere, Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini has labelled Yaya Toure his 'son', noting: 'With him, what an Inter!' There has been much speculation over the Ivorian's future at Manchester City, and Mancini has been honest in admitting his interest in the midfielder.

"A former Portuguese detective was today ordered to pay nearly £360,000 to Kate and Gerry McCann after a long-running libel trial. Goncalo Amaral had been on trial over claims he made in a book and a documentary that the couple were involved in their daughter Madeleine's disappearance. In a written verdict, a Lisbon court agreed that Amaral should pay Mr and Mrs McCann €250,000 (£179,000) each in damages and banned further sales of his book The Truth Of The Lie. The couple's lawyer Isabel Duarte also revealed that Amaral had been told to pay interest which she said stood at present at €106,000 (£76,000). Scroll down for video . Kate and Gerry McCann have reportedly been awarded £360,000 in damages from an ex-Portuguese detective who wrote a book claiming their daughter Madeleine had died in an accident instead of being abducted . Police chief Goncalo Amaral (above) ran the initial investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann . Madeleine was three when she went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Mr Amaral, who led the initial investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, released his book three days after the case was closed in 2008. He later took part in a documentary for Portuguese television in which he claimed that Madeleine was dead, that there had been no abduction and the McCanns had hidden her body. The couple, who accuse Amaral of hampering the search for their daughter, had been expected to receive around £1million in damages. Amaral's lawyers have leave to appeal the ruling. The McCanns told the court last summer they were left 'devastated and crushed' by his book, which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief. Mrs McCann, 47, said Madeleine's twin siblings Sean and Amelie, now ten, knew Mr Amaral had written a book but didn't know the detail. Amaral claimed Madeleine (above) had not been abducted, but had died in an accident in Praia da Luz . She told the court last July after applying to make a statement: 'I believe that's what's in Mr Amaral's book and the documentary is very distressing to adults. 'To a child, it could be very damaging.' Asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book, she said: 'I was devastated. 'It made me feel quite desperate because of the injustice I felt towards my daughter and our family as a whole. 'It was very painful to read and I felt sad for Madeleine. I also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage I felt it was doing in Portugal.' She went on to accuse Amaral, thrown off the investigation in 2007 for criticising British police, of 'consistently smearing' them. She also claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter's whereabouts.

"They’re the kind of colourful adverts that would have been created by the real-life Don Drapers, Peggy Olsons and other ‘mad men’ of Madison Avenue. These vintage posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience, passengers wore their best clothes and there was plenty of legroom. They’re featured in a new coffee table book, Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975, which revisits a time when the skies were dominated by the likes of Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp (BOAC) and Continental. Scroll down for video . Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was a dominant and influential airline which declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1991 . Many of the adverts in the book featured beautiful women in an effort to glamorise destinations and encourage people to travel . British Airways promoted its launch of the Concorde in the 1970s (left) while Trans World Airlines (TWA) promoted its New York route . Authored by Matthias C Huhne, the 436-page book contains dozens of glamorous adverts that encouraged those who could afford to fly to visit far-flung destinations such as Haiti, Hawaii, Japan, New York and London. The simple but effective posters showcase each destination with eye-catching cartoons or photos of beautiful women, landmarks such as Times Square and Tower of London, and natural beauty spots including Bermuda’s picturesque coastline and Sydney Harbour. New York was one of the most popular destinations featured in the adverts in Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 . The adverts were created for the biggest airlines of the day, including TWA and Canadian Pacific, which no longer exist . British Overseas Airways Corp led to the creation of British Airways (left) while Continental merged with United Airlines' parent company . It was a time when it cost an incredible amount of money to purchase a ticket for a commercial flight, with many of the ads promoting transatlantic or transpacific travel. The adverts created for the biggest airlines of the day, including many which no longer exist, offer a glimpse at how air travel, advertising and society changed over the 30-year period covered in the book. From a psychedelic image of a surfer in Hawaii to British Airways' introduction of the Concorde, the posters reflect the eras in which they were created by some of the best creative minds of the time, including Ivan Chermayeff, Otl Aicher, Massimo Vignelli and Saul Bass, Academy Award-winning filmmaker. The posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience and passengers dressed smart . The book hails the designers' creative genius and uses special techniques to replicate their work as accurately as possible . In addition to drawings the adverts include photos of natural beauty spots, including Sydney Harbour (left) and Bermuda's beaches (right) Mr Huhne’s book hails their creative genius and uses 17 colours, five types of varnishes and two methods of foil printing and embossing to replicate their work as accurately as possible.

"An eagle demonstrated its footwork after gate-crashing a football team’s training session and enjoying a solo kick-about. Filmed in North Vancouver, the bird - which appears to be a golden eagle, despite some speculation that it is a young bald - is captured standing over a football during its try-out before giving it a slight peck with its beak. After standing and shaking its head, the big bird then moves forwards and rolls the ball to the left with its foot. The bird interrupts the training session by approaching a football and giving it a peck before enjoying a kick-about . Excited by the movement, it runs after it and rolls the ball to the right before jumping up on it with both feet. As the ball rolls away the members of the North Shore Football Club, whose training session had been interrupted by the eagle, can be heard laughing. The bird then runs back over to the football and a youngster can be heard saying: ‘The eagle has landed.’ The eagle gets excited and after rolling the ball, jumps up onto it with both feet and causes it to move . Rolling the ball back a few more times, the bird once again jumps onto it before stopping to give it another peck. Upping the quality, the eagle rolls the ball to the left once more but this time keeps its foot on top of it so that it is controlled underneath. It then successfully jumps up onto the ball with two feet and balances for a moment before its momentum causes the ball to roll away - as if it had given it a kick. The eagle successfully attempts to roll the football with both feet on a number of occasions . The ball is then passed back to the bird by the video maker, but the eagle seems to have lost interest and lets the ball roll by. Before turning and running over towards it with an unmeasured amount of excitement. The video concludes with what must be the team’s coach saying: ‘Okay guys let’s get back in the grid, let’s go.’ The majestic bird finishes its kick-about and sits beside the ball before deciding to fly away . And the bird, who sits majestically next to the football for a moment, flying away. According to National Post Canada, the boys from the North Shore Football team, delighted by the eagle, were from Sutherland secondary school in Vancouver.

"Brendan Rodgers took radical steps to transform Liverpool’s season as he feared a failure to do so would leave him in danger of being sacked. Liverpool’s fortunes have transformed since Rodgers drastically switched his side’s system to an attack-minded 3-4-3 formation in December; they are the form team in the Barclays Premier League, having taken 27 points from the last 33. The memory of how bad things were in November, though, has not left Rodgers and he has admitted that his experience at Reading, when he was axed in December 2009 after just 20 matches in charge, triggered his decision to rip things up and start again. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers speaks to his coaches during a training session at Melwood . The former Swansea City manager shares a joke with Ivorian defender Kolo Toure in training . Rodgers chats to England full back Glen Johnson during the training session at Melwood . Rodgers is highly-regarded by Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners, and he signed a new long-term contract last May but the 42-year-old knows none of that would have mattered had his side’s results continued on a downward spiral. ‘I certainly wasn’t going to roll over and die,’ said Rodgers, whose side face Burnley On Wednesday. ‘I love it here and I want to be successful. But after the Crystal Palace game (in November when Liverpool lost 3-1) in particular, I felt ""it doesn’t matter how much support you have, the team is not functioning"". ‘It could not go on, really. My experience at Reading told me that. That’s what I learned from that sacking. I went in with the full backing of the chairman, who was great to me. Even though it was a three-year project and they wanted me there, I got the sack after 20 games. ‘I learnt that it does not matter how much support you have in the boardroom, you have to get results – and you have to win. So I needed to make sure that I was going to make decisions which would allow us to get back to at least somewhere near where we were. Liverpool beat Premier League champions Manchester City 2-1 in their last league outing . Midfielders Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho both scored brilliant goals during the win . Rodgers admitted the fear of being sacked had driven him on to turn the club's results around . ‘I think the transformation in the team has been really good to see; to see the confidence, and everyone talking about the system and how dynamic it is, and the fluency. I should have done it earlier! I am an innovative coach and I needed to find a way to make us play better.’ At the lowest point in the campaign, when Liverpool tumbled out of the Champions League and were playing predictably, Rodgers’ was noticeably subdued, particularly before they drew at home to Basel in December. He needed to lift himself as much as his players. ‘We had a huge challenge, probably the biggest I have had as a coach or

Sarah Wilson opened up in a candid interview about how her battle with mental illness drove her to believe her life wasn't worth living . During the intimate interview Ms Wilson revealed it was a combination of issues, including mounting stress, anxiety, her thyroid disease and distant family, that drove her to believe her life was no longer worth living. She said 'people get on with their lives' and while she hadn't found a husband, nor had children, she felt increasingly isolated. 'I was essentially very alone,' Ms Wilson added. 'My anxiety brought me to a point where I couldn't quite see the existential point of continuing' 'I couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel,' she added. Ms Wilson said while she struggled through her younger years she has recently 'found some peace with it.' In Ms Wilson's eyes, depression and anxiety are intrinsically linked. She thinks we need to acknowledge this link to be better equipped to tackle the increasing rate of Australian women who are being negatively affected by stress and anxiety.

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is under no illusions about the potential repercussions of Monday night’s visit to Old Trafford. Any clash against Manchester United, particularly in the Wenger era, carries added value for the Gunners. The fact that it is an FA Cup quarter-final with a place at Wembley at stake merely adds to the occasion. And for Wenger it’s a chance to land what could be a crucial psychological blow on Louis van Gaal’s side ahead of the tense season finale. Theo Walcott holds off Nacho Monreal as Arsenal trained on Sunday at their London Colney training ground . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain lets fly with a shot, as Arsene Wenger promised his team would attack United . The Gunners squad are put through their paces as they look to reach Wembley for the third time in two years . Arsene Wenger is confident his team can beat Manchester United by playing attacking football . The FA Cup isn’t the only competition in which these two giants are going toe to toe. They are also battling for a Champions League position, a race which is perhaps more pertinent to both clubs’ long-term ambitions. There are no points at stake tonight but Wenger said: ‘It’s a big game, and every big win in a big game has an impact subconsciously in the belief of the team.’ However, the reverse is also true. Losing against United could plant a seed of doubt in Arsenal’s quest to finish in the top four — and their poor recent record at Old Trafford doesn’t bode well. United have won nine out of their last 10 home games against the Gunners. We shouldn’t forget, though, that Wenger also has pleasant memories of the Theatre of Dreams. He lists Sylvain Wiltord’s goal that clinched the title for Arsenal at Old Trafford in 2002 as his favourite. And the Frenchman insists his current crop of players can produce another win in United’s back yard on Monday night. Arsenal's World Cup winning playmaker Mesut Ozil has been in top form since returning from injury . Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez, who scored a brilliant goal in midweek against QPR, looks lively in training . Per Mertesacker, whose place was in doubt before an injury to Gabriel, gestures to his team-mates . ‘I don’t believe our recent record at Old Trafford (to be a factor). When the team is less good, they lose. When the team is not as good, they lose,’ said Wenger. ‘It doesn’t matter what shirt they wear, or what stadium they play in. It is down to quality. ‘If I’ve learnt something in my life it’s that the performance on the day decides the outcome of the day, not where you play. ‘The fact that we can win away from home, that is important. If you haven’t won away from home all season it’s more difficult. But we know we can do well away from home.’ Tomas Rosicky attempts to control the ball as Walcott, Mertesacker and Ramsey watch on .

"Dame Jane Goodall has condemned politicians for pushing 'Frankenstein Food' Dame Jane Goodall, the renowned primate expert, has condemned ‘deluded’ politicians for pushing ‘Frankenstein Food’. The highly respected academic has endorsed a new book, which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers. Historically, critics of GM food have been lambasted by the GM companies, scientists who rely on their funding, and politicians, including the UK Government, as being ‘anti-science’. However, Dame Jane argues that the advocates of GM food have ignored evidence of harm with the result it is they who are guilty of being ‘anti-science’. The intervention is a powerful condemnation of the way biotech companies like Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer, have forced GM crops and food on to dinner plates in the US without proper safety tests. And she is joining a growing campaign warning that Britain and Europe must not drop safeguards that have kept GM crops out. Dame Jane’s concerns have been raised in the foreword to a new book, ‘Altered Genes, Twisted Truth’, which is written by the American public interest lawyer, Steve Druker. Its publication comes as the US is seeing a growing backlash against GM. Just last week it emerged that the country’s favourite chocolate manufacturer, Hershey, is to drop GM from its products. Dame Jane said she has become appalled as what she calls a ‘shocking corruption of the life forms of the planet’. She said the GM process, which involves adding foreign genes to plants to create toxins to fend off insects or give them immunity to being sprayed with chemical pesticides has fundamentally changed them. However, she complains that supporters of the technology have committed a ‘fraud’ by trying to give the false impression that these new plants are essentially the same as those created by conventional plant breeding. She said: ‘This very real difference between GM plants and their conventional counterparts is one of the basic truths that biotech proponents have endeavoured to obscure. As part of the process, they portrayed the various concerns as merely the ignorant opinions of misinformed individuals – and derided them as not only unscientific, but anti-science. ‘They then set to work to convince the public and government officials, through the dissemination of false information, that there was an overwhelming expert consensus, based on solid evidence, that the new foods were safe. Yet this, as Druker points out, was clearly not true.’ Importantly, she claims, the companies have spread disinformation to try and win public support. ‘Druker describes how amazingly successful the biotech lobby has been – and the extent to which the general public and government decision makers have been hoodwinked by the clever and methodical twisting of the facts and the propagation of many myths. Moreover, it appears that a number of respected scientific institutions, as well as many eminent scientists, were complicit in this relentless spreading of disinformation.’ Dame Jane is considered to be the world’s foremost expert on chimpanzees. She is best known for her 55-year study of social and

"Momentarily, he looked his age. Having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin, Jordan Spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green. History was assured. He wasn’t going to three-putt from there, so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the Masters. He wanted it to be more than that, though. The best it could be. The exuberance of youth was kicking in. Spieth missed. For the first time around Augusta, he made a mild mis-step. He wheeled away, hopped a little, almost coltish in his frustration. He marched back to his ball, prepared to tap it in. Except it wasn’t a real tap-in. There was a bit still to do. And at that point, Spieth checked. He stepped away. He marked his ball. He let Henrik Stenson play. He did the sensible thing. Spieth always does the sensible thing. That is part of his wonder. Jordan Spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14-under 130 . Spieth leads Charley Hoffman by five strokes, matching the largest halfway lead in Masters history . Some might think that makes him boring. It doesn’t make him boring. To shoot 14 under, the lowest two-round score at Augusta, and equal to the best 36-hole score recorded at a major championship, isn’t boring. We may be watching a sporting phenomenon. A performance as breathtaking as Tiger Woods’s arrival in 1997. There will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole. If Spieth repeats his achievement at the Hero World Challenge in Florida last year, perhaps, when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. Those numbers are unlikely though. As the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery, his scores are bound to fall. Against that, it will be a lot harder to chase Spieth’s total than just maintain it. Modern courses have, of course, been Tiger-proofed before — but in the short term Augusta may need to be Spieth-proofed, too, if his scoring stays stable. This was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. He has been in the top three players in five of those six, too. ‘I was a bit out of my comfort zone, at the moment on the 18th,’ Spieth confirmed. ‘I was going to have to work around Henrik’s line — and I just thought if I step away I am definitely going to make this putt, so that was the only way I could miss. ‘I have to work to control those things the next two days. If I can shoot 14 under then a lot of other players could shoot 14 under, so I have to be ready for that and to match their scores now. The stress levels can get pretty high. Still, it’s pretty cool any time you can lead the Masters and to

"Labour would overhaul school inspections in favour of a ‘light-touch’ system allowing teachers to assess each other, Tristram Hunt said . A Labour government would overhaul school inspections in favour of a ‘light-touch’ system allowing teachers to assess each other, the party’s education spokesman has said. Tristram Hunt said a new peer review system would free up teachers from an ‘avalanche of bureaucracy’ and increase confidence in the regulation process. The proposals, which would result in Ofsted taking a less hands-on approach, could be a reality by 2020 if Labour was elected, he said. Mr Hunt acknowledged that the regulator had been a vehicle for progress, but said it was beginning to ‘choke something far more precious’, and threaten the ‘joy’ of schooling. Speaking at the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Liverpool, he said: ‘We can begin the process of “mass devolution” where important powers over professional standards, quality assurance, curriculum development and peer review are handed over to profession-led bodies – and we will. ‘Ofsted needs to move towards a supportive, light-touch, profession-led, centrally moderated, peer review system of inspection. ‘I want this conference to hold me to account for moving towards it over the course of the next Parliament.’ The proposals would see teachers and head teachers helping to assess the performance of other schools. Scroll down for video . Ofsted would regulate this process, although the details of how the system would work have not been finalised. Mr Hunt said: ‘Let nobody tell you this is a soft touch. Let nobody tell you this is a threat to standards. Rather this is the embodiment of trust, collaboration and a 21st-century approach to rigour and under-performance.’ The proposals would see teachers and headteachers helping to assess the performance of other schools (file picture) He added: ‘I want to see an inspectorate that moves beyond box-ticking and data-dependence. ‘I want to see an inspectorate that allows heads with a strong track record the space to innovate and develop a richer criterion of school achievement.’ Priya Dutta, spokesman for the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘The system needs an overhaul, and in general we would welcome proposals for this. ‘But the problem with peer review is that it’s so open to abuse. ‘We would be sceptical about how impartial this peer review would be, so these things would need to be planned very carefully. ‘I’m slightly wary of Ofsted taking a step back because I think there needs to be an independent teaching review body. I wonder how effective peer review would be in practice.’

A Labour government would overhaul school inspections in favour of a 'light-touch' system allowing teachers to assess each other, the party's education spokesman has said. Tristram Hunt said a new peer review system would free up teachers from an 'avalanche of bureaucracy' and increase confidence in the regulation process. The proposals, which would result in Ofsted taking a less hands-on approach, could be a reality by 2020 if Labour was elected, he said.","

"Jonny Howson's double inspired Norwich as they maintained their promotion charge in style with a ruthless 4-1 triumph over relegation threatened Millwall at The Den. The hosts spurned numerous chances in a tense first half before Howson surged from midfield to fire a sublime left-footed strike beyond keeper David Forde. Gary Hooper doubled Norwich's lead with a penalty just before the break after Cameron Jerome was felled by Alan Dunne, before Wes Hoolahan made it three and Howson scored his second on the hour. Jonathan Howson scores the first goal of the game during the Championship match at The Den . Howson celebrates his opener with Norwich City teammate Bradley Johnson as the Canaries smash Millwall . It's all too easy for the away side as they deal Millwall manager Ian Holloway yet another striking blow . A stunned Millwall found enough resilience to claim a goal back after Diego Fabbrini won a penalty that Lee Gregory converted but it was too little too late to ease the pressure on beleaguered manager Ian Holloway. After sustained Norwich pressure for the first 20 minutes, Millwall began to respond, as Jos Hooiveld saw his powerful volley blocked by Carlos Cuellar before Ricardo Fuller struck team-mate Martyn Woolford with another effort. The lively Fuller continued to threaten as first Cuellar and then Martin Olsson clumsily fouled the striker on the edge of the area, but the hosts squandered both opportunities from either side of the box. Gary Hooper celebrates his goal from the penalty spot as Norwich all but seal the points at The Den . Norwich City's Wesley Hoolahan celebrates scoring their third goal in the win against Millwall on Saturday . The hosts' wastefulness was duly punished in the 38th minute when Howson surged through midfield and struck an exquisite drive beyond Forde from outside the area to give Norwich the lead. While Howson's goal was slightly harsh on Millwall, the hosts had themselves to blame for Norwich's second on the stroke of half time. Graham Dorrans' long-range effort was saved well by Forde, only for Alan Dunne to needlessly fell Jerome as the striker went to retrieve the rebound, with Hooper firing the resulting penalty straight down the middle. Millwall manager Holloway looks on as his Lions are tamed by the Canaries at The Den on Saturday . Norwich City manager Alex Neil gives his squad the thumbs up as they comfortably see off Millwall . Millwall's Shaun Williams (left) and Martyn Woolford combine to stop Norwich City's Johnson . Norwich had barely broken sweat in establishing a two-goal advantage and had a chance to make it three soon after the restart but Jerome headed Olsson's cross straight at Forde. Yet it was not long before the visitors effectively ended the contest as a slip by Millwall's Sid Nelson was capitalised on ruthlessly by Hoolahan, who drove a left-footed strike beyond Forde on 57 minutes. And just three minutes later, the Canaries claimed a fourth all too easily as Jerome broke down the left before calmly delivering the ball across the box

"Manchester City are pressing ahead in their interest for Wolfsburg's Kevin de Bruyne. The Bundesliga side want to keep the Belgium international for at least one more season as they plan a crack at the Champions League next year. However, City, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain are all interested in signing him this summer. Manchester City are pressing ahead with a deal for Wolfsburg playmaker Kevin de Bruyne . De Bruyne has been in fine form for club and country this season and is rated at £40m . De Bruyne celebrates with Marouane Fellaini (c) and Radja Nainggolan after a goal against Cyprus . De Bruyne’s agent Patrick de Koster has hinted it would take a bid close to £40million for Wolfsburg to consider selling. Talking last week he said: ‘Clubs who are ready to bid 30million euros for Kevin have no sense of reality. A player like Kevin has a market value of some €50million, €55m or even €60m by now.’ De Bruyne, 23, cost Wolfsburg £16.7m when he signed in January 2014 from Chelsea and has scored 14 goals for his club this season. City defender Aleksandar Kolarov has admitted he’s tempted by a return to Italy after starting just 11 Premier League games this season. The 29-year-old Serb, who cost £16m from Lazio in 2010, fuelled the speculation while praising the job compatriot Sinisa Mihajlovic has done as manager of third-placed Sampdoria. He told Sky Italia: ‘I’d like to return to Italy, but it’s difficult. ‘I’m happy for Mihajlovic. He’s doing very well, as are Lazio.’ De Bruyne, who signed for Wolfsburg in January 2014, chats with team-mate Andre Schurrle against Mainz . De Bruyne is a former Chelsea youngster but never got a real chance to impress at Stamford Bridge . Meanwhile, Yaya Toure has suggested he may be about to step away from international football, after claiming ‘my target is done’. Toure captained the Ivory Coast to glory in this winter’s Africa Cup of Nations, their first major trophy in over two decades, and could now follow his brother Kolo in retiring after suggesting that the Elephants’ new generation should be allowed to flourish. ‘My future?’ he said. ‘You have to wait. Now, my target is done. The time of the youngsters will come soon. We need to let them. ‘It’s always beautiful when everything is going in the right way. I’m delighted with the trophy of 2015. Now I will wait a couple of days before we decide my future.’

"(CNN)More than 300 suspects have been arrested in South Africa in connection with deadly attacks on foreigners that have forced thousands to flee, the government said Sunday. ""We once again unequivocally condemn the maiming and killing of our brothers and sisters from other parts of the continent,"" the government said. ""No amount of frustration or anger can justify these attacks and looting of shops."" Thousands sought refuge in temporary shelters after mobs with machetes attacked immigrants in Durban. The attacks in Durban killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. Heavily armed police have scrambled to stop clashes after local residents accused immigrants from other African nations of taking their jobs. The government praised law enforcement agencies for stopping further bloodshed in Durban. ""We believe that their commitment to duty has prevented injuries and even deaths that could have happened if they security forces had not acted,"" it said. The xenophobic sentiment is certainly not representative of all South Africans. ""There has been an outpouring of support from ordinary South Africans who are disgusted with the attacks not only because they are foreign, or African, but because they are fellow human beings,"" said Gift of the Givers charity, which is helping those seeking refuge. The charity said last week that about 8,500 people had fled to refugee centers or police stations because of the violence. South Africa's government implored citizens to remember the country's history of overcoming challenges with the support of African neighbors. ""During the Apartheid many South Africans fled persecution and death at the hands of the Apartheid government,"" it said in its statement. ""Africa opened its doors and became a home away from home for many South Africans."" President Jacob Zuma has canceled a trip to Indonesia and visited displaced foreign nationals in Chatsworth to express his support, the government said. The Gift of the Givers charity assured immigrants that it has a facility in Johannesburg to help those who might need shelter there. ""We have tents and all essential supplies on standby but pray that sanity prevails and this does not become necessary,"" it said. In the past, Johannesburg has been the epicenter of anti-immigrant tensions. In 2008, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. In that attack, police arrested more than 200 people for various crimes including rape, murder, robbery and theft. CNN's Larry Register contributed to this report.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)A few months before Nigeria's national elections, both main candidates embraced and promised a peaceful election. That pledge is now under serious threat. Protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state as they marched to protest national elections held to elect Nigeria's next President. ""There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable,"" said Lai Mohammed, spokesman for the main opposition party, the All Peoples Congress. The All Peoples Congress says the vote has been rigged, voters intimidated and demanded that the elections held in Rivers state be canceled. The ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party, refutes the accusation, saying the election was ""credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan."" Heavy rain eventually forced the protesters home, but there are fears that it will take more than rain to stop further protests and violence. ""We are concerned by what seems to be happening,"" said Attahiru Jega, Nigeria's election chairman, about events in Rivers state. Nigeria has just held what are thought to be the closest elections since a return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military rule. The two main candidates are incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan and retired general Muhammedu Buhari. What is at stake in the protests in Rivers state is not whether Nigeria can hold an election, but can it hold a ""close"" election. Voting is now over and the results are being counted. Jega says the final result will likely be announced within 48 hours. The fear is that the results may not be accepted by whomever loses. And if the opposition believes it has been rigged out of victory by the ruling party, then the protests in Rivers state could spread to northern Nigeria. Over 800 people were killed in post-election violence across the north after the 2011 elections were thought to be illegitimate. And so both candidates have taken to social media to call for calm. ""I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results,"" stated Jonathan on his Facebook account.

"Dina Amos-Larkin (above), 21, has been left paralysed from the neck down after falling 50ft from a hotel balcony in Salou, Spain . A British gymnast has been left paralysed from the neck down after falling 50ft from a hotel balcony. Dina Amos-Larkin was attending a four-day sports festival in Salou, Spain when she fell while talking to her mother on the phone on April 3. The 21-year-old law student, who represents Great Britain at trampolining, was in a medically-induced coma for two weeks and was told of her injuries when she was brought round a week ago. She told Simon Wright of the Sunday Mirror that authorities initially said the fall, from a fourth floor balcony at Hotel Jaime 1, was a suicide bid. 'That isn't the case - I spent the day doing sport and went drinking in the evening, but wasn't drunk,' she said. 'The balcony rail was lower than my waist and I think I just leaned back too far.' The student, from Poole, Dorset, claimed she is now stranded in hospital as she is waiting for her insurer AXA to review her case. A GoFundMe page has since been set up to raise £20,000 to get Miss Amos-Larkin, who is also captain of the Angels cheerleading squad at Surrey University, home. More than £13,900 has already been donated. The page reads: 'Dina Larkin suffered horrendous injuries including paralysis when she fell from a balcony during a student festival in Barcelona. 'Dina is an international gymnast and aspiring law student. But most of all she is a daughter, a sister and a friend to many. 'Her recovery has been halted because the costs of getting her back to the UK amount to over £10,000. And then there's the adaptive care she will need when she is home.' Her mother Audrey, 48, and father Stephen, 49, told the Sunday Mirror their 'hearts are broken'. The street the hotel is on (above) has lots of high-rise apartments with white rails lining each balcony . A GoFundMe page has since been set up to raise £20,000 to get Miss Amos-Larkin (above), who is also captain of the Angels cheerleading squad at Surrey University, home . 'We just want her home,' they added. Her last Tweet was a week before the incident, when she posted a photo of the cheerleading squad after the Team Surrey varsity and wrote: 'These kids know the score! @Surreyangels brought it home.' She added a picture of the sea on Instagram five days later and wrote: 'Enjoying that ocean spray. Let's hope it can cure this hangover #TOUR #spain #sunshine #ocean #saloufest #coastline #teamsurreytour2015.' A spokesman for AXA said: 'We are looking into the circumstances and until those investigations have been completed, it would not be appropriate to comment further. 'We are speaking to Dina and assisting with her repatriation.'

"Jordan Wills works as a paintball target, with colleagues firing paintballs at him at close range . When student Jordan Wills goes to work he must prepared to pelted by bullets, fired at him at close range and at speeds of almost 40mph. The 19-year-old from London works as a human bullet impact tester, or more simply a paintball target, and every week faces the pellets being fired at his torso to test how hard they are on impact or how large a welt they leave. He beat more than 10,000 other applicants from around the world to land the £16,000 a year job as a tester and fits in being used for target practice around his university studies. 'I guess I have a high pain tolerance - but it's really not as painful as people think,' said the Kingston University Computer Graphics student. 'The hardest part is the anticipation when you know it's coming. 'The most times I'd be shot at during a shift is ten over a course of an hour or two.' And while most people playing paintball will wear some form of protective clothing, Mr Wills does his job in just a t-shirt. He is a fan of the game anyway, and has previously played a lot in his spare time. He works 16 hours a week at different UK Paintball sites across the country on a pro-rata salary of £40,000, which works out at a wage of around £16,000 a year. Mr Wills, who stays in shape as a rower, said despite the welts and the occasional pain he loves his job. He added: 'When people find out what I do they think I'm crazy - but I love my job. 'The initial pain lasts for about five seconds, then it stings for maybe ten seconds - and then it's gone. I don't even remember I've been shot.' The teenager wears protective goggles to cover his eyes - but trusts his well-trained colleagues to steer clear of other vulnerable body parts and stop when he tells them to. The paintballs are fired at Jordan's torso at close range - between 25 and 30 feet by a professional shooter at a speed of almost 40mph. Rather than take the usual approach of fleeing the oncoming paintballs, Mr Wills must stand still while players take aim at him. He reports back on the impact of the paintballs so that manufacturers can ensure new batches are not too hard. Anything that draws blood, leaves too serious a mark or does not explode on impact is unacceptable. Mr Wills was selected for the role out of 10,000 other applicants because of his knowledge of paintball . The 19-year-old often suffers welts on his body from the impact which take three or four days to disappear . The practice leaves him with welts over his body, but the student said he barely notices. 'Sometimes I take a hot bath after a shift, but mostly I just forget they're even there,' he added. 'At first my girlfriend didn't like it, but now she's

After Kimmel's effort sung in the Tagalog, a language spoken by about 57 million of the Philippines' more than 98 million people, went viral Pacman took to Twitter to thank the comedian for singing his song. Pacquiao's 80s-style music video includes a montage of the boxer's fights and his humanitarian efforts .

"A Montana judge who was censured by the state's high court for his comments about a 14-year-old rape victim has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. Scroll down for video . Selected: Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association. He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence.

"British Airways could be facing a compensation payout of up to £90,000 following a pungent smell that forced one of its flights to return to Heathrow Airport. The BA flight to Dubai returned to London due to a foul odour emanating from an overflowing toilet, and three passengers have since filed claims for compensation due to the travel disruption. They argue they are entitled to hundreds of pounds each after cabin crew were unable to fix the problem and the flight turned around near Brussels. A British Airways captain told passengers the smell was from 'liquid faecal excrement' in a toilet . Passengers were initially told that they would board another flight in three hours, but it turned into a 15-hour delay. Three passengers have contacted Claim4Flights.com to seek up to €600 each (£450) in compensation, the maximum allowed for a delay of more than four hours when travelling over 2,200 miles as stipulated by EU rules. If all 200 passengers on board the flight were to claim, BA could be forced into paying out up to£90,000. One claimant is Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev, who was travelling to Dubai with his pregnant wife and two-year-old daughter. At the time he took to Twitter to explain how a 'smelly poo in the toilet' had forced the plane to turn back and land at Heathrow. Tory councillor Abhishek Sachdev was travelling with his pregnant wife and their two-year-old daughter . Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev said passengers were told that crew could not fix the problem . Speaking to MailOnline Travel Mr Sachdev, a Tory councillor, said: 'We had booked a night flight to allow my two-and-and-half-year-old daughter to sleep. 'Initially we were told that the delay would be three hours until another flight. When we landed, the pilot said it would be a 15-hour delay, until 1pm the next day. A smell emanating from the toilet on a BA flight forced the plane to turn back (file photo) 'This meant we lost a whole day of our holiday, and that we also had the stress of travelling on a daytime flight with our toddler daughter.' Mr Sachdev decided to lodge a claim with Claim4Flights.com after being unimpressed with how BA officials dealt with the situation. 'At the baggage collection area, we were told by some BA staff to queue for information. After 15 minutes in that queue, we were then told there was no need to do so, and were given a leaflet,' he added. 'This leaflet simply said BA apologised for the technical fault, even though the pilot was clear that there was no technical fault. 'We then had to wait 25 minutes to get our accommodation and food voucher. About five or six staff were trying to print these for us but couldn't because of system problems they said. 'This was now midnight and we had pleaded with them to hurry up but it still took a long time to resolve. Then we got to the hotel, and had to wait another 25 minutes to check in.'

"Controversial: Hertz installed the cameras as part of the in-car NeverLost app in 2014 . Car rental company Hertz has been slammed by customers for putting cameras inside their vehicles. The controversial device was installed as part of the in-car navigation system and guide, NeverLost 6 app, which was introduced in 2014. Drivers fear the lens is a breach of their privacy, but the firm insist they do not work and have no plans to turn them on. They also state they do not have the bandwidth capabilities to support video streaming. The cameras were added so drivers could interact with a member of the customer services team during an emergency or when stationary. To start a conversation, the motorist or a passenger would have been able to turn on the camera themselves - but because of technical difficulties the feature hasn't been integrated into the system. Rich Broome, a spokesman for Hertz, told the Daily Mail Online it would have been completely customer activated and could not have been turned on remotely. He added that there is 'nothing behind the lens' and there is no timetable to connect the device. However some drivers who regularly rent from Hertz have still expressed their concern at the camera's presence. One customer wrote on the forum Flyertalk: 'I am a regular renter from Hertz (President's Circle). This week after the usual excessive wait for the Hertz airport shuttle, I got into a rental car at O'Hare airport. 'I immediately noticed the new NeverLost and I was completely shocked to see a camera built into the device looking at me. The system can't be turned off from what could tell. Further investigation revealed that the camera can see the entire inside of the car. 'I know rental car companies have been tracking the speed and movements of their vehicles for years but putting a camera inside the cabin of the vehicle is taking their need for information a little too far. Breach of privacy? Some drivers have expressed their concern at the presence of the device, but the hire car firm said there is 'nothing behind the lens' and the camera simply doesn't work . 'I find this to be completely unacceptable In fact, if I get another car from Hertz with a camera in it, I will move our business from Hertz completely. I influence car rentals of many others and I don't think anyone would want to be on camera while they are driving around or sitting at a red light. 'Given what Hertz has invested in this system, I wonder how much consumer pressure will make them to pull the plug on this. Business is built one customer at a time and they will no longer have me as a customer.' The company told a Twitter user who criticized the use of the lens: 'The camera in the NeverLost device was never activated as we do not have adequate bandwidth capabilities to the car to support streaming video at this time.' Mr Broome added that if any customer has any concerns with

"Diarist Anne Frank likely died a month earlier than previously thought meaning there was little chance of her surviving the Holocaust, according to new research. It was previously believed that the Jewish teenager, who was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, died of typhus on 31 March 1945, two weeks before the camp was liberated. However a new study puts the date of her death at some point in mid February, meaning that even if British troops had reached the camp a little sooner, she would likely not have survived. Scroll down for video . Anne Frank (pictured) likely died of typhus inside the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in mid February 1945, a study has shown, not on March 31 as previously thought . Anne's diary, which documents how her family went into hiding from the Nazis in the Netherlands during the Second World War, became a bestseller when it was published after then end of the war. The book documents how Anne, her sister Margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house, but were eventually betrayed and sent to Bergen-Belsen, where she and her sister perished. Anne Frank wrote her diary while in hiding from Nazi persecution during World War II. By 1940 the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped. In 1942 the family went into hiding in secret rooms of Otto Frank's office building. But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945. Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame. After the war the Dutch government set the official date of her death as March 31, based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in March. Because the Allies liberated the camp on April 15, this added a bitter twist to her tale - the thought that if she could have hung on a few weeks longer she might have been saved. However, Erika Prins, a researcher at the Anne Frank House museum, has now revised that date having studied witness accounts, archives, and conducted at least one new interview. Ms Prins said she now believes that Anne and her sister began exhibiting symptoms of typhus at the beginning of February. According to Dutch health authorities, most patients do not live for more than 12 days after that. 'In view of this, the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in February. The exact date is unknown,' the study says. Ms Prins added: 'It was horrible. It was terrible. And it still is. But when you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. Bergen-Belsen was liberated in April 1945, meaning if Anne died in March, then she was two weeks from rescue. But this new study shows she was months from safety (Anne pictured left, with father Otto, and right)

"Brendan Rodgers has criticised Raheem Sterling’s advisor, suggesting that the player is being manipulated by outside forces and that he would be inclined to stay at Liverpool if left to make a decision alone. With Liverpool losing 4-1 at Arsenal on Saturday and seeing their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season effectively ending, Rodgers made veiled criticisms of the player’s agent, Aidy Ward, after the televised interview Sterling gave last week, in which he admitted he was flattered by Arsenal’s interest in him. Rodgers also revealed that he has sat down with Sterling since that TV interview and to tell him that his best interest would be served by staying at the club for now, even though there may come a time when he does leave. Raheem Sterling goes past Mathieu Flamini during the Barclays Premier League match at the Emirates . Sterling has reject a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal at the end of this season, but Rodgers said: ‘I’ve had a good chat with him. I have given him my opinion on it. This is a young kid who has been advised to do something else. A 20-year-old boy does not pick up the phone to ask to speak to the BBC. ‘You don’t do that; him in particular. He just wants to play his football. But of course if he’s asked to do that by other parties then that’s what he’ll do. ‘In the modern game it is obviously something that frustrates us all but it is the market and where football is at. In fairness to Raheem, I brought him in from the youth team and the reserves and I know that a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him.’ Sterling has rejected a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal . ‘In my time in coaching there are a lot of very, very good agents. The only thing I would say on Raheem’s situation is that anyone can see that for his football development and financially, Liverpool Football Club is the best place for him. There is absolutely no question of that. ‘I think he enjoys being at Liverpool and loves playing for Liverpool and knows he is privileged to play in front of Liverpool supporters. As a kid he knows the opportunity is there for him to improve as a footballer. What that will be in five, six, seven years time is different. But for this moment of his career and life, he really enjoys it. He has said that himself.

She was busy rattling off a roster of men who had proposed to her over the decades, when she broke off and fixed a skinny guest with her gimlet eye. ‘After 40,’ she told me, ‘a woman has to choose between her face and her figure. My advice is, keep a lovely, plump pretty face, and stay sitting down.’ Scroll down for video . Former model and actress Candice Bergen, 68, admits in her recent memoir that food is fun, and that it is ridiculous and sad to vomit or starve to stay stick-thin . Then she took to a chair to demonstrate, in a froth of princess-pink tulle from which her elaborately painted face rose in triumph. As she got up again and started working the room, distributing souvenir gold-leaf acorns from her garden and finishing the list of long-deceased suitors — the object of her remarks, a skinny fellow journalist, scowled and fiddled with her lettuce. I — past 40 by then — smiled my chubbiest, most complacent smile. It’s not often my tribe get our bums and faces validated over those of grumpy glamazons. In Bergen's (pictured in the 1960's) memoir she merrily admits to putting on more than 2st over the past 15 years . Now, that face-and-figure tip has been reiterated by Candice Bergen, former model, actress and Oscar nominee, whose memoir A Fine Romance will be published soon. In it, 68-year-old Bergen merrily admits that over the past 15 years she has put on more than 2st. ‘I am a champion eater. No carb is safe,’ she joshes. Food is fun, she believes, and it is ridiculous and sad that her contemporaries either starve or vomit in secret to stay stick-thin. Bergen sounds a riot, just the girl for a grand night out. She also sounds — and here’s the key — confident and sexy. None of that weird, skeletal, Sarah Jessica Parker or Victoria Beckham vibe for her, nor that gristly, hard-body Madonna look, all abs and biceps. Oscar nominee Candice Bergen (pictured) is confident, sexy and fun, despite putting on more than 2st over the last 15 years . Her brand of femininity, which is shared by domestic goddess Nigella Lawson, is a bounce and a grin, a wink and a cuddle. The buxom woman’s image may not suit the gay-dominated fashion industry or the anxious self-hating celebrity circuit, but children (and, frankly, most men) gravitate towards the comfortable female form. Both have an entirely natural instinct to bond with a female who seems fun, comfy, confident and able to enjoy her food. Bergen and Nigella's healthy, curvy figures differ from the tiny frames of celebs such as Victoria Beckham (pictured) and Sarah Jessica Parker . Indeed, scientists lately delighted us with news that the particular sort of fat on the female backside is rather special. It is vital for

"A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house has been spared jail. He was sentenced by Judge Noel Lucas (above) at Guildford Crown Court . A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house while her live-in carer was out has been spared jail. Timothy Norris-Jones, who had previously attacked his mother on two occasions, left her with bruises on her face and a cut on her right wrist that needed stitches, a court heard. The 59-year-old told police the injuries were caused when she fell and said he had accidentally 'caught her face' when he went to catch her in November last year. He was arrested after the victim's carer returned home and called the police. His mother later told detectives: 'He just blew up. 'He was pushing my face and holding my wrists. I can remember I said: ""Stop this Tim, don't do it"".' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. A forensic psychologist told the court that emotionally damaged Norris-Jones looked to his mother for support and 'lost his rag' when she could not provide it. Judge Noel Lucas, sentencing, branded the attack 'horrific' and added: 'It is pretty unforgivable to strike an elderly lady.' He said: 'You gave your mother a systematic beating. 'If I had taken the view that your actions were anything other than those of an ill and weak man, I would now be sending you to prison for a substantial amount of time.'

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton is now officially a candidate for president -- and the never ending Clinton story rumbles on. She has been a part of all our lives now for approaching a quarter of a century. She started as the first lady that the right loved to hate, then the deceived wife, next a senator, then a candidate for president in one of the most dynamic primaries in history and finally, a secretary of state. The Republicans have their aristocratic Bushes, the Democrats have their Clintons. And if Hillary or Jeb were to win two presidential terms, then in the 44 years from 1981 to 2025, 28 will have had a Clinton or a Bush in the White House. The great American republic now looks about as democratic as ""Game of Thrones."" But even though Hillary Clinton has been around nearly my entire lifetime, The Economist may speak for many when it asks: ""What does Hillary stand for?"" There is a paradox she presents: She is by far the best-known presidential candidate across both parties and, for the moment, almost unchallenged within her own. Yet even though Diane Feinstein can assert confidently that Hillary ""doesn't 'need' (the White House). But she wants it"" -- the question unanswered is ""What for?"" And for liberals, who believe that government is there to do something, it's this lack of definition that is surely so disconcerting about Clinton. There are good grounds for a liberal primary challenge to Clinton. The economy has revived under Obama but, say critics, largely to the benefit of Wall Street and the super-rich. The riots in Ferguson, Missouri, were a painful reminder that the poor, particularly the nonwhite poor, have been left behind. Clinton's credentials as a fighter against inequality are mixed. It is true, as the Wall Street Times notes, that she has previously called for ""universal prekindergarten, equal pay for women, increases in the minimum wage, paid family leave, higher taxes on the wealthy and an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for working-poor families."" But she counts among her friends precisely those corporate people blamed by the Occupy crowd for the country's inequality. Clinton is now, wisely, trying to distance herself from the Clinton Foundation -- after all, its fundraising efforts among foreign interests are hardly the stuff of populist liberalism. Then there is her foreign policy record. Clinton voted in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War (though in her memoir last year, she backed away from the vote, writing that she ""got it wrong."") As secretary of state, she is easily associated in the mind of the left with such controversies as the war in Syria, the crisis in Libya and the collapse of the Mubarak regime in Egypt. That some of these may have had little to do with her is beside the point. Clinton is going to have to spend a sizeable amount of time during the primaries explaining and defending the things that occurred while she was working for the Obama administration. Her personal ethics are on the agenda, too -- as demonstrated by the flap

The Conservatives’ economic strategy also won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne. Employment rose above 31million in the three months to February, official figures showed – 557,000 higher than a year before. The Conservatives’ economic strategy won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together. ‘There are now two million more people in work than in 2010,’ the Prime Minister said. The encouraging numbers came as Rolls-Royce announced its biggest-ever order, worth more than £6billion, to power passenger jets for the Middle Eastern airline Emirates. IMF chief Christine Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble praised Mr Osborne’s ‘wonderful job’ of handling the economy. In a blow to Labour, which has opposed most of the Government’s austerity measures, Mrs Lagarde said the Government had provided the ‘right balance’ of spending cuts and tax rises. The plan had reduced the deficit from a record £153billion under Labour in 2009-10 to £90billion last year. She said she had ‘no doubt that can continue to be the case in the future’ under Mr Osborne’s plans to return Britain to the black in 2018-19, a pledge Labour has failed to match. David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together . ‘The fiscal deficit has been significantly reduced over the last few years,’ said Mrs Lagarde. ‘Added to that it is clearly also delivering results. It is obvious that what is happening in the UK has actually worked.’ Mr Schaeuble said he was ‘full of respect’ for what the Chancellor has achieved and delivered what amounted to a highly unusual endorsement of the Tories. ‘The UK and the UK economy has done a wonderful job in the last couple of years,’ he said. ‘The UK and George Osborne has a very good plan for the future. I am very much in favour of what has been achieved and what has been forecast.’ The Chancellor, speaking at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, said the UK ‘is one of the brightest spots in the world economy at the moment’. ‘I am here representing the UK with an economy that is firmly on course – the deficit halved as a share of GDP, strong growth, record high employment, record low inflation,’ he said. Greece poses the biggest threat to the global economy and the deepening crisis could hit Britain, George Osborne warned yesterday. Fears are mounting that the recession-battered country will default on its debts and be forced to leave the eurozone, creating an economic and political earthquake.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)A day after winning Nigeria's presidency, Muhammadu Buhari told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he plans to aggressively fight corruption that has long plagued Nigeria and go after the root of the nation's unrest. Buhari said he'll ""rapidly give attention"" to curbing violence in the northeast part of Nigeria, where the terrorist group Boko Haram operates. By cooperating with neighboring nations Chad, Cameroon and Niger, he said his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals and others contributing to Nigeria's instability. For the first time in Nigeria's history, the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections. Buhari defeated incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by about 2 million votes, according to Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission. The win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in Africa's most populous nation. In an exclusive live interview from Abuja, Buhari told Amanpour he was not concerned about reconciling the nation after a divisive campaign. He said now that he has been elected he will turn his focus to Boko Haram and ""plug holes"" in the ""corruption infrastructure"" in the country. ""A new day and a new Nigeria are upon us,"" Buhari said after his win Tuesday. ""The victory is yours, and the glory is that of our nation."" Earlier, Jonathan phoned Buhari to concede defeat. The outgoing president also offered a written statement to his nation. ""I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country, and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,"" Jonathan said. ""I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word."" Buhari, 72, will be sworn in on May 29. He will take the helm at a critical time, as Nigeria grapples with Boko Haram, serious economic woes and corruption. This isn't Buhari's first time leading Nigeria, but it's his first time in nearly 30 years. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983, closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari. But Buhari himself was ousted by another military coup in August 1985. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? His presidential win is the result of his fourth attempt to lead the country since he was ousted 30 years ago. Buhari is a Sunni Muslim from Nigeria's poorer North, while Jonathan comes from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. Buhari praised voters for exercising their right peacefully. ""Your vote affirms that you believe Nigeria's future can be better than what it is today,"" he said in his statement. ""You voted for change, and now change has come."" Buhari campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime. He stressed that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. His campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of ""new broom,"" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. Despite years of democracy,

"An Egyptian court has sentenced a popular Armenian belly dancer to six months in prison for 'insulting the Egyptian flag' after she wore a tight dress in its red, white and black color scheme. The court in Agouza, west of Cairo, said Sofinar Gourian, popularly known as 'Safinaz', was fined £15,000 after being found guilty in a case raised by a private complainant. She is expected to avoid jail time, however, after paying £10,000 bail and launching an appeal against the six month prison sentence. Offending dress: An Egyptian court has sentenced popular Armenian belly dancer 'Safinaz' to six months in prison for 'insulting the Egyptian flag' after she wore a tight dress in its red, white and black color scheme . Insulting the flag was made illegal by decree under Egyptian President Adly Mansour who ruled for a year after the army overthrew an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013. The change in law made it a crime to raise, display or sell an Egyptian flag if it is damaged in any way, or even if the colour has faded. The law also prohibits adding slogans, designs or pictures to the Egyptian flag. Ms Gourian is understood to have worn a costume made from the material taken from an Egyptian flag during a belly dancing performance in the town of Ain Sokhna in 2013. The belly dancer, who lives in Egypt, had argued that she did not insult the flag intentionally and as a foreigner was less aware of Egyptian laws. Harsh laws: Insulting the Egyptian flag was made illegal by decree under President Adly Mansour who ruled for a year after the army overthrew an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013 . The complaint against her was filed by a businesswoman and hotel owner in Mohandeseen who found the performance insulting, according to Ahram Online. Although she has been convicted of the crime, her £10,000 bail allows her to remain free until her appeal has been heard. Ms Gourian has lived and worked in Egypt for the past two years, where her act has proven to be an immediate success. The Armenian native has already appeared in several Egyptian movies, performed at society weddings and is married to an Egyptian national. Ms Gourian has previously told reporters she hopes to spend the rest of her life in the country.

"The BBC boss who insulted nearly half the country earns an enormous salary without even working full-time, it emerged yesterday. Trying to rebut allegations of BBC elitism, £330,000-a-year Alan Yentob insisted the corporation did make programmes for C2s and DEs – a technical term for the working classes. Viewers said his comments on Newsnight were arrogant and showed he was out of touch. And yesterday the BBC had to admit that – despite commanding a salary more than twice that of the Prime Minister – Mr Yentob’s job is ‘not a contracted full-time role’. Part-time worker: Alan Yentob, pictured, is paid £183,000-a-year as the BBC's creative director, and gets a separate salary as editor and presenter of BBC programmes such as the arts series Imagine . In an embarrassing series of letters, the BBC also struggled to explain what he does as creative director, claiming it is ‘highly specialised and bespoke role unique to him’. Asked for Mr Yentob’s job description, it said that he was ‘a leading figure in the broadcast world’ but was unable to detail his duties. The 68-year old media grandee is paid one salary of £183,300 a year for his work as creative director, and another as editor and presenter of BBC programmes such as the arts series Imagine. He has refused to say exactly how much this is, but BBC insiders says it is ‘easily’ in the region of £150,000 a year, bringing his total package to around £330,000. On Wednesday Mr Yentob was wheeled out to explain the decision to sack Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear but was ridiculed for bungling his lines. Fluffed: Yentob appeared on Newsnight to explain the decision to sack Jeremy Clarkson (pictured) but was ridiculed for bungling his lines . He claimed Mr Clarkson had ‘already suffered’ by being dropped from the show and it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest he shouldn’t be paid until the end of his contract. Mr Yentob then said the BBC did not cater only for the metropolitan elite saying it ‘reached out to…C2s [and] DEs’ – who account for more than 46 per cent of the population. Last night, John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP from Birmingham Yardley, called for an investigation into Mr Yentob’s pay. ‘It sounds to me a lot like somebody who is a popular person within the BBC hierarchy getting a bung for just existing,’ he said. ‘There should be an inquiry into where the value for money is.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘As creative director, Alan oversees the BBC’s creative strategy across all content and services including acting as the focal point for all BBC talent management. ‘Alan has also built the BBC’s partnerships with arts and cultural organisations across the UK.’

"The Black Hawk helicopter that crashed in dense fog during a training mission in Florida was carrying seven Marines from Special Operations Command forces based in North Carolina, and four National Guard soldiers from Louisiana. Bad weather prevented the recovery of bodies and the flight recorder from the wreckage on Thursday, and while the military had not officially released any times, loved one of those on the doomed copter did speak with the press.. Now however, the names and identities of the seven Marines have been revealed. Scroll down for video . Crews lower a piece of a Black Hawk helicopter onto a barge in the Santa Rosa Sound near Pritchard Point in Florida . Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif (left) and Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock (right) Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif was a Silver Star Medal recipient who received the award for facing enemy fire to save a mortally wounded friend in Afghanistan in July 2012. He was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until middle-school when his family moved to Holland, Michigan, the Marines said. Seif, 26, grew up playing soldier in his backyard and joined the Marines just weeks after graduating from high school, according to an article about his award published this week in the Camp Lejeune Globe, the post newspaper. By 2012, he had spent two years as a special forces operator with the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, which operates from the Middle East to Central Asia. Seif and his teammate, Sgt. Justin Hansen, were closing in on one of western Afghanistan's bomb experts, according to the paper. They came under fire, and Hansen was hit. Seif moved Hansen to safer position and treated his teammate's wounds. Seif returned fire, advanced alone across the compound and found the targeted bomb-maker. 'The fact that (Seif) continued to fight through the objective to get Sgt. Hansen taken care of, putting himself in the line of fire, speaks volumes to who he is and demonstrates that he would never leave a Marine behind,' said Maj. Gen. Joseph L. Osterman. Seif's wife was at his side when he received the medal. Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock, 29, was born in Lake Orion, Michigan, and swam on the varsity swim team. He attended Henry Ford Community College for one year before joining the Marine Corps in 2006. Initially, he was a mechanic in an armored reconnaissance battalion at Camp Pendleton in California. He served two tours in Iraq in 2007 and 2008. His decorations include the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Valor. His home near Camp Lejeune was within earshot of dull booming sounds of artillery or other heavy weapons. Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders (left) and Staff Sgt.

"(CNN)Are the upcoming elections in Israel crucial? Will the results -- a fourth term for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or a first for opposition leader Isaac Herzog -- change Israel's policy in a significant way? As Israelis prepare to go to the polls, the answer seems to be negative. Many observers in Europe and the United States seem to be under the impression that during Netanyahu's time in power, Israel was hijacked by right wing zealots -- and that Herzog, leader of the Zionist Union opposition party, is the man who will save the country and return it to the path of sanity. But the fact is that when it comes to the most crucial question regarding the future of Israel and the Middle East -- what to do about the Palestinians -- the difference between the two candidates is negligible, a divergence that is short on substance but long on style and rhetoric. While Netanyahu's insistence on Israel's continued ruling over millions of Palestinians is expressed in aggressive, often religious and nationalistic language, Herzog's justifications for doing the same thing would sound much softer and easier to digest in the Western world. But at the end of the day, neither Netanyahu nor Herzog have any real intention to put an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories. Netanyahu says it clearly and openly; Herzog and his coalition partners only hint at it. READ MORE: 5 key issues for next Israeli leader . This whitewash has been so evident throughout the entire election campaign that a foreigner arriving in Israel would have had a hard time understanding anything about what is really going on here. The main issues that have been discussed during the campaign are economic ones -- cost of living, housing prices, government oversight -- but even then, slogans and populist promises have largely replaced the in-depth debates we should be having. But the topics that seem to have consumed most of the headlines range from pure gossip to scandals, some of them concerning the behavior of Netanyahu and his wife Sara. There was the ""bottlegate"" affair -- claims that the wife of the Prime Minister had pocketed cash from bottle recycling at their official residence. The Netanyahus say they reimbursed the government. Israel is a country that is still looking for its way forward; one that lacks internationally recognized borders; one that has not yet decided whether it is a Western society or a Middle Eastern one; one that cannot decide whether it wants to be religious or secular, Jewish or bi-national. All of these critical issues -- none of them decided on -- have been cast aside, ignored, covered up or denied by a country that has busied itself with the important business of recycled bottles at the prime minister's residence. There is a big elephant in the room, but Israel is turning its back to it. There is a big elephant in the room, but Israel believes that if nobody talks about it, the elephant does not exist.

"Debra Winch, 44, receives up to 60 spam text messages every day after she was turned down for a payday loan . Highly sensitive financial details from loan applications are being sold to scammers and cold-calling firms, the Mail can reveal. Details of how much money applicants asked for, why the cash was needed and why the application was rejected are all being stored on lists and traded. Vulnerable people desperate for cash are then bombarded up to 60 times a day by cold callers and targeted by scammers who have apparently obtained access to the data. The loan records of more than 3,000 applicants were passed to undercover Mail reporters by one data firm. When the Mail contacted people on the spreadsheet, they said their lives had been made a misery since they applied for the loans. Some said they have been targeted by scammers because their bank details had been made widely available. Policeman’s wife Debra Winch, 44, receives up to 60 spam text messages every day after she had an application for a £600 payday loan declined. The mother of three has since been conned out of £360 by two companies which knew her bank account details and removed the money without her knowledge. Afterwards, one of the scammers spoke to her on the phone and said ‘Catch me if you can’ before hanging up. Mrs Winch said: ‘Having a policeman husband and a son who works in security, I try to be careful giving my information, so am upset my information has got into the hands of the wrong people. ‘I haven’t signed any forms and wouldn’t because I don’t know who I’m dealing with. I feel completely violated. It is amazing how much they know about you.’ The loan records were passed to the Mail’s undercover reporters by Birmingham-based firm Targeted Response Direct. Scroll down for video . The data – including the applicants’ names, addresses, work details, how much they had tried to borrow, what they wanted the loan for and why it was turned down – was sent to the reporters as a free sample via email in two spreadsheets, neither of which was password protected. David Billington, a director of Targeted Response Direct, said people kept these records because there was ‘money in it’. When asked where the information came from, he named four payday loan broker websites: www.little-loans.com, www.supaloans.co.uk, www.gocheaploans.co.uk and www.supafinance.co.uk. David Billington (left) director of Targeted Response Direct (pictured with colleague Nick Moore) claimed people kept these records because there was 'money in it' Last night, the City watchdog said such exploitation was unacceptable and vowed to crack down on the firms involved. And the owner of three of the loan sites involved said it had stopped trading in customers’ data after being contacted by the Mail. Christopher Woolard, the Financial Conduct Authority’s director of strategy and competition, said: ‘This exploitation of consumers – many of whom are vulnerable – is unacceptable. Credit brokers cannot pass on consumers’ data without their knowledge, or charge a fee for broking without their consent.

"Cesc Fabregas perks up when he talks about the killer instinct, the ruthless streak that all teams develop at the start of a success story. On instant recall is the World Cup in 2010, when Spain turned to every available resource to reach the final after titanic struggles against Paraguay in the last eight and Germany in the semi-final. Fabregas was part of that team, realising a boyhood dream when he lifted the most famous trophy in world football with one of the best sides in history. Cesc Fabregas urged his team-mates to develop a killer instinct in order to progress past Paris Saint-Germain . Fabregas makes his way on to Chelsea's training pitch with John Terry, Cesar Azpilicueta and Gary Cahill . The Spanish midfielder jokingly wrestles with Didier Drogba and Terry during Tuesday's training session . Chelsea’s dressing room is developing a winning mentality again, lifting their first trophy together at Wembley 10 days ago when Jose Mourinho’s team won the Capital One Cup. It has given them belief. ‘When you unlock the mental fear of the quarter-final, which is what we did with the national team, we felt we could become champions,’ said Fabregas. ‘Once we were champions we were unstoppable, but you have to take this fear out and take it away. We have to believe we are the best. ‘We have to be ready mentally to win every situation because this game will not be a walk in the park.’ He was talking about Wednesday evening’s opponents Paris Saint-Germain, a tough nut to crack in the Champions League as Laurent Blanc’s team arrive in London protecting an unbeaten run that stretches back to January 10. Fabregas likes what he sees in the Chelsea dressing room and yet his experience, after nearly 500 appearances for club and country, tells him there is still room for improvement. ‘If there is one thing missing it is killing teams,’ he admitted. ‘Sometimes we don’t kill them when we have the chance. ‘When we score one we have to score more and more. That’s the only way we can really improve, developing that killer instinct.’ Chelsea can smother teams, a tactic Jose Mourinho has refined quite brilliantly over the years with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid.

Fabregas loves his football at Chelsea, cheerfully claiming that he is at the top of his game following his move from Barcelona last summer. ‘I have to be more disciplined and you don’t see me in the box so much,’ he added. ‘I am more positional, always behind the ball, always finding solutions for the other players and controlling the tempo. ‘If you asked me 12 months ago whether I would work with Jose I would have said “no”, but you

"A man who passed out at a friend's party woke up with more than a hangover when he discovered a guest had tattooed his back. While Josh Darnbrough, 24, slept, his mate Rob Gaskell, also 24, inked the words 'If found face down call an ambulance' on his back, using a DIY kit. Josh, from Mossley, near Ashton, only discovered the prank the following day after looking in a mirror - and said his partner went 'absolutely bonkers' when she saw it. Josh Darnbrough awoke after a party to find that his friend had tattooed his back . Josh (centre) was tattooed by his friend Rob Gaskell (right) who was taking revenge on his mate after Josh had attempted to tattoo Rob with an at-home kit and it went horribly wrong . Rob said he carried out the practical joke on Josh, who had passed out at a New Year's Eve party, in revenge for a tattoo Josh did on Rob's leg two years ago - which had gone horribly wrong. Starting off with a design for a lizard, Josh tried to turn it into a cross, then some hands and a gun - leading to one almighty, permanent mess on Rob's leg and causing his partner to go 'bonkers'. So when he saw Josh passed out at the party, Rob - who is a father of three - said he 'couldn't resist' the opportunity to execute revenge - and spent 30 minutes etching his own design into his mate's back. Amazingly, the prank hasn't harmed the pair's friendship - and the childhood friends, who are both having their tattoos removed, still see each other every day. But Rob does admit to regretting the prank once he had sobered up. He said: 'The opportunity presented itself and I couldn't resist. 'I didn't feel guilty when I was doing it because I'd had a few drinks myself but I was quite remorseful afterwards and asked everyone not to tell Josh who had done it.' Josh, who is a support worker, said although it was a shock, he has managed to see the funny side. 'I was pretty astonished when I looked in the mirror - I thought, ""I didn't go to bed with a tattoo""', he said. 'I didn't know when I'd got it and no one would tell me who'd done it. But since I found out it was Rob it hasn't affected our friendship at all - we still see each other every day. It's just practical jokes between mates.' Rob, also a support worker, added that he would advise anyone against at-home tattoos. 'We had bought a DIY tattoo kit online and originally it was a well-intentioned exercise,' he said. 'Then when it didn't turn out right it dawned on me this was forever and I was stuck with it.

If we were there just a couple of minutes earlier it could have been a different story. ‘The kids were very, very scared but when the driver got out he was laughing and after a while started to boast that he would “just go out and buy another one tomorrow”.’ Martin Johnson said he was walking his granddaughter Charly Pennett home when the wheel flew past .

"Convicted Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan who turned to God after being handed a death sentence in Indonesia has been ordained as a Christian minister. After six long years of study inside Bali's Kerobokan jail, the 31-year-old was ordained inside the prison's chapel last month as he found out his and Myuran Sukumaran's plea for clemency from Indonesian president Joko Widodo had been rejected again. The Sydney man was ordained by Christie Buckingham, a senior pastor with the Bayside Church in Melbourne, who bought with her a letter of accreditation approving Chan as a Christian minister in Australia. Scroll down for video . Convicted Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan (left), seen here with Matius Arif Mirdjaja who he baptised, has now been ordained as a Christian minsiter . Five senior ministers from different denominations endorsed Chan after he spent years studying the religion and helping drug addicts within the prison. Reverend Buckingham told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'I have never experienced a student like Andrew, and probably never will again. He is extraordinary. He has such a determination to learn, in fact almost a desperation.' 'He is the real deal, and Myuran [Sukumaran] is as well. They are living proof that people can change, circumstances can change. Indonesia should be proud of the impact they are having,' she added. Sukumaran and Chan await transfer from Kerobokan prison to the death island of Nusakambangan, where they are set to face the firing squad . Sukumaran (left) and Chan (right) are both said to be changed men since they were arrested in 2015 on heroin smuggling charges . Reverend Buckingham first met the pair in 2011 after her friend founded Indonesian charity group Yayasan Tangan Kasih (Arms of Love) which works in Kerobokan prison. In February, a former inmate of Kerobokan prison told Daily Mail Australia how he was baptised by the Bali Nine member. He said Chan helped him kick his 20-year drug addiction, and called on the Indonesian government to show the Australian mercy. When Matius Arif Mirdjaja first spoke to Andrew Chan in prison in 2011 he mocked him for his religious beliefs. The pair knew of each other from the previous three times Mirdjaja had been ordered to serve time but had never spoken. After Mirdjaja was baptised, he and Chan (second left) started up a Bible study group inside Kerobokan prison . It was not until Mirdjaja (pictured) personally witnessed Chan's devotion to God that he started to believe in Christianity . In 2011, the Indonesian - who is now 40 years old - was imprisoned for robbery. '[The first time we spoke] we had a debate about philosophy and Christianity,' Mirdjaja told Daily Mail Australia. 'At that time, I mocked him because I said that 'The Christian foundation is a really silly thing to believe. How do you as a Christian believe in someone who died on the cross and couldn't save his own ass and you expect him to save your ass?'' Mirdjaja said Chan did not get offended by this exchange and just smiled

Chris has improved and developed immensely during the short time that I have been at the club and has become an integral part of the first-team squad. ‘He always conducts himself in a very professional manner and it is also pleasing that he has scored some important goals this season too.’ Smalling, who cost United £10million from Fulham in 2010, has made 147 appearances and won two Premier League titles.

We have developed as a team over the course of the season under Louis van Gaal and we are now playing as a complete unit. ‘This is a very exciting time to be at Manchester United. We are all determined to get back to where we belong and competing at the highest level.’ Smalling has established himself as a permanent member of England's squad during the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign and that boils down to his vast improvement under Van Gaal.

Provodnikov (right) lands an uppercut to the head of Matthysse despite having a cut opened up early on .

He continued to use his three-inch reach advantage to keep Provodnikov at bay, giving him room to dodge the Russian's powerful left hook. Provodnikov landed several punches in the later rounds but couldn't knock down his Argentine opponent down, although he did stagger Matthysse in the 11th. 'He did, he hurt me,' Matthysse said through a translator. 'But I was able to withstand the onslaught. He's a very tough fighter. He's very strong. He just keeps coming forward.' Don Ackerman scored the fight as a draw 114-114, but Glenn Feldman and John McKaie both scored it 115-113 in favor of Matthysse. 'To me, he was better today,' Provodnikov said through a translator. 'He was the better man in the ring and, you know, it was a close fight but he won and I hope everybody enjoyed it.' The night's undercard was quickly decided when Patrick Teixeira (25-0, 21 KOs) won with a second-round knockout of Patrick Allotey (30-2) in their middleweight bout. Provodnikov admitted that Matthysse was better than him on the day in the majority decision win . Matthysse said he just wanted to rest but talked up a fight with Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao next . The sell-out crowd then had to wait more than an hour for the main event, watching the TV feed of Terence Crawford beating Thomas Dulorme for the vacant WBO junior welterweight title in Austin, Texas. WBO president Paco Valcarcel tweeted he would like to see Crawford defend his title against Matthysse, but the Argentinian had his sights set higher. 'For right now I just want to rest,' Matthysse said. 'I got my daughter, my family waiting for me back home. I want to rest. I want to go back there and see them so much and let's see what happens with (Manny) Pacquiao and (Floyd) Mayweather.' Matthysse and Provodnikov prepare to hug at the end of their fight on Saturday night in Verona, New York .

"Fresh fears were raised last night that Greece could exit the eurozone after it was claimed negotiations with its European creditors were ‘not working’. An official at the International Monetary Fund reportedly admitted that he cannot envisage a successful conclusion to the country’s bailout. Greece this week repeated threats to stop paying off its loan and default on its debt if Europe refuses to release more funds. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors . This would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone, although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's Europe Director has been quoted by the Greek media as saying he could not see a successful conclusion to the country's current bail out. The fund's Europe chief reportedly told his executive board that negotiations were not going as hoped, the Daily Telegraph reported. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors. One Greek official has been quoted by the Financial Times as saying that if the European Central Bank did not play ball with the Mediterranean Eurozone member there could be no alternative to a default. Mr. Thomsen also issued a warning over Greece's recent, weak economic performance. He met with Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis earlier this month. Greece repaid a roughly €450 million loan instalment to the International Monetary last week but Athens' financial problems, as outlined by Mr. Thomsen, have renewed fears the country might miss the IMF payment of €200m payment on the 1st May and another for €745m 11 days later. This could lead to he EU member being forced, eventually, to leave the eurozone. The IMF debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended €240 billion in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (left) met with Mr. Thomsen who expressed worry over the Greek economy. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' (right) government has been talking with creditors since January . Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason. He said at a conference last week that Greece was 'not going to sign on the dotted line of anything you give us just to get the next loan tranche', 'At the very same time,' he added, 'we need to have a fiscal plan that makes sense. At the moment Greece is committed.' However,Greece's new left wing-led government which has been locked in strained negotiations with creditors since winning elections in January continues to hold its recent election victory over the international community.

"Mystery surrounds the sensational CCTV footage showing the gem thieves in the middle of their audacious £60million heist after it was suggested that the police had missed this crucial evidence. The Daily Mirror published sensational pictures of the Hatton Garden raiders 21 hours before Scotland Yard released them in a bid to appeal for information about identities of the thieves. The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted', according to a report today in its sister title The Sunday Mirror, with an apparent source saying it 'blows the case wide open'. But yesterday afternoon detectives insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'. Pictured: The Met has released images of three of the gang which broke into Hatton Garden over the Easter weekend - but has only done so after the shots were revealed by the Daily Mirror . Audacious: Exactly why the police did not release the images beforehand is unclear - especially as the tabloid's sister paper The Sunday Mirror claims they are the key to 'cracking the case wide open' This is in stark contrast with the response given to MailOnline hours before, when police refused to say whether they had the footage. The Met finally released the pictures late on Saturday afternoon, while The Mirror could sell the images to a number of other national titles, including this website. Up until that point, no other newspaper was able to help the police trace the culprits of what could be the biggest ever robbery in Britain. It raises questions about why the police chose to keep them to themselves - or whether they even had the footage. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme this morning, former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said: 'I've never heard of anything like this. 'I'm not blaming The Mirror, but I am pointing some quite accusing fingers at the police for not finding it themselves.' Questions: Former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said he had 'never heard of anything like' a newspaper getting such crucial footage before the police got their hands on it - although police now say they had it . It is likely to put further pressure on an investigation which has already been accused of a number of failings. Owners of the security deposit boxes are continuing to demand answers on why police failed to respond to the alarm when it first went off over the long weekend. And now the MailOnline has revealed some have resorted to bribing security guards, as they desperately try to find out information about what has been lost. The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The CCTV will have gone some way to answering questions for those who lost thousands of pounds in the theft. It reveals how the raiders entered the building by a side door on Thursday evening, minutes after staff left the premises. They then entered the basement through the lift shaft, and broke

"One of Australia's most popular pain killers has been left with a splitting headache, as the national consumer watchdog gets ready to take it to court. Reckitt Benckiser, the company behind Nurofen in Australia, will square off against the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in federal court this month over claims that it has mislead customers. The ACCC will dispute claims made by the company that the Nurofen Specific Pain Range is specially designed to target different types of pain. The consumer watchdog claims that all products contain identical ingredients. Scroll down for video . Australia's consumer watchdog is taking Nurofen to court over its advertising claiming its products target specific types of pain . The products in question are: Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache. ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said cracking down on false advertising surrounding medical products was a targetted priority for the watchdog. 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' Mr Sims said. 'In this case, we allege that consumers have been misled into purchasing Nurofen Specific Pain Products under the belief that each product is specifically designed for and effective in treating a particular type of pain, when this is not the case.' 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' chairman Rod Sims said. It also flagged the 'significantly' higher cost of Nurofen compared to other products as a concern, with the range in question costing up to twice as much as a standard pain killer sold by Nurofen or another comparable brand. A Nurofen spokeswoman denied the allegations in a statement, and said pain-specific products made life easier for customers. 'Nurofen is committed to the quality use of medicines and promoting and protecting the health of Australians,' the statement read. 'Nurofen works closely with all regulatory bodies to ensure high standards compliance to guidelines. 'Nurofen will continue to work with regulators to ensure its packaging continues to be fully aligned with all guidelines and requirements and still offer consumers with clear pain relief options for their pain type.' The ACCC is seeking declarations, injunctions, an order for the publication of corrective notices, penalties and costs. The matter is listed for a case management conference in the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney on March 31.

"Police arrested former Premier League footballer Calum Davenport for allegedly assaulting one of his own team-mates after a local league match in Bedfordshire. Davenport, 32, a former England Under 21 defender who played for West Ham, has been bailed by officers after a man in his 30s received head injuries in the away changing room at Cranfield United. Both men were playing for Elstow Abbey FC and Davenport had been sent off. Calum Davenport (pictured here in 2009) was arrested for allegedly assaulting his team-mate . Davenport was arrested after playing for Elstow Abbey at Cranfield United (ground pictured above) Village football club Elstow play in Division 1 of the Bedfordshire County Football League . His Premier League career ended in August 2009 when he was stabbed in the legs by his sister's boyfriend. Ed Frost, chairman of Cranfield United told the Bedfordshire on Sunday: 'The incident occurred in the away changing room between away players, it was isolated there and didn't spill over into the club house. 'This followed a tense game between two teams at the top of the table, in which Mr Davenport was sent off in the latter stages.' An ambulance spokeswoman said: 'The East of England Ambulance Service Trust was called to an incident on Crawley Road at 3.32pm on Saturday, March 14. Davenport had spells at West Ham and Tottenham but struggled to hold down a first-team place at either club . 'An ambulance was called to a man in his 30s with a suspected head injury and who was taken unwell. He was taken to Bedford Hospital for further care.' Bedfordshire Police have bailed Davenport until April 17. The defender started his career at Coventry before joining Tottenham for £1.3million but he only made 20 appearances over three years and spent time on loan at West Ham, Southampton and Norwich. Davenport joined the Hammers permanently in 2007 but was again farmed out on loan, to Watford and Sunderland. He spent two years with United Counties team Wootton Blue Cross in a bid to regain fitness ahead of a return to the senior game which never transpired. In 2009, Davenport was charged with assaulting his sister during an incident in which he was stabbed in both legs. He was later cleared of all charges.

"Mexicans take it literally when they amp themselves up for a night out in their country's capital. A drinking game popular in Mexico City takes shock-factor to the extreme as friends affirm their macho status by competing over who can handle the most electricity, and they connect themselves to a live current. Known as 'toques' - Spanish for 'touches' - the game has seen a recent surge in popularity through the city, and has seen players' nights-out cut short by urgent visits to the emergency room. 'The drunker people get, the more voltage they can generally handle,' says Javier Rodriguez, who has worked the lively Condesa neighbourhood of Mexico City for the past 35 years. Scroll down for video . Electricuting: Javier Rodriguez has been offering drinkers the chance to play 'toques' for 35 years . Painful: It requires a player to withstand as many volts of electricity coursing through their body as possible . Cheap thrills: People pay £1.50 for a round, and Javier can expect to make more than £300 in a weekend . 'I've seen party-goers pass out after passing 100 volts, although it usually has something to do with what they've been drinking.' 'It's fun,' said Leonardo Flores, who eagerly took up the challenge when Javier passed by clicking the metal handles to make the sound known throughout the capital as a toques vendor. 'It gives you a jolt and you feel good afterwards,' he told the MailOnline, who watched as he withstood 85 volts of electricity passing up his left arm and then down his right. 'People also say it makes hangovers less painful, but that hasn't ever been my experience.' Javier walks a circuit of the bars and restaurants in the trendy party district from 3pm until the early hours of the morning, clicking together the metal handles that players hold onto to complete the electric circuit, which can reach up to 120 volts. UK mains supply runs at around 240 volts. 'It's a long-standing tradition here in Mexico,' he said. 'I've been hired to offer the game at private events: weddings, funerals, Sweet 16 birthday parties, town fairs, political dinners, pretty much everything. 'It's become part of our country's drinking culture. Wherever Mexicans are drinking in large numbers, you can be certain someone is going around offering the electrocution game.' 'Fun': Despite pictures suggesting the contrary, some people claim they enjoy the sensation . Device: The two handles send volts of electricity through the player's body, starting off at just 20 volts . Secret cure: It is also claimed a game of toques can make your hangover less severe in the morning . Each round costs £1.50, and Javier can expect to make more than £300 on a lively weekend in Condesa, one of Mexico City's most popular nightlife districts. Good business, given that that Mexican minimum wage stands at under £150 a month, and that his only expenses are eight AA batteries every three or so weeks. He claims Mexicans are always his best clients, and that not only are international visitors less likely

"Middlesbrough bounced back from defeat to Watford with a convincing 2-0 win over struggling Rotherham United. After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table. Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday . Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79), Forshaw, Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85), Bamford, Garcia Martinez. Subs not used: Ripley, Vossen, Amorebieta, Wildschut . Goals: Tomlin 50, Bamford 66 . Rotherham: Martinez, Hunt, Broadfoot, Wood, Lafferty, Smallwood, Arnason, (Frecklington, 69) Bowery, Green (Sammon, 76), Hammill, Derbyshire (Ward, 59) Subs not used: . Booked: Arnason, Frecklington . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 19,537 . After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved

"As the election race hots up, Labour leader Ed Miliband is getting a small taste of what it might be like to be a member of One Direction. A group of female fans, who've dubbed themselves the 'Milifans', are rallying support for the opposition leader on social media using the Twitter hashtag #milifandom. The largely teenage fanbase have spent the days running up to the May 7th election posting tweets of affection for the politician. Led by Twitter user @twcuddleston, an AS Levels student by the name of Abby, the unlikely fan club has prompted hundreds of tweets from fellow users who share their admiration for the Labour leader.

In her Twitter profile, she describes herself as 'leader of the Milifandom, a movement against the distorted media portrayal of Ed.' And even she is amazed at just how the hashtag has taken off, saying 'There are those in the milifandom, those who find the milifandom funny, and those who wonder how the hell Ed Miliband has a fandom.' Perhaps fearing a gaffe, the Labour leader has remained tight-lipped on what he makes of the Milifans but did tweet the teen behind it, @twcuddleston, saying 'Hi Abby - Delighted that you've joined Labour - welcome.' While Abby seems to be a genuine Labour supporter and a level-headed teen - she's declined giving interviews in favour of revising for her upcoming exams, others seem to be more preoccupied with Miliband's physical appearance than his abilities to run the country. One user @Helen121 defended criticism of Miliband, saying he's 'not ""mouldy"", he's hot!' Another, @helenamelia_xox, said 'If I ever met ed miliband I actually would cry he's so hot.'

"(CNN)There is always champagne at these things, but this art opening is an actual party. Purple light bounces off the white walls in the massive foyer of London's Royal Academy; punk music falls down the stairs and Kenneth Anger's homo-erotic biker short Scorpio Rising is playing on a TV screen. Jarvis Cocker is here, and so are Bob Geldof and Rupert Everett. There are the requisite grey ladies in fur and chapeaux, as well as twenty-somethings in backpacks huddled in groups, downing their drinks before walking into Pace London's booze-free exhibition space for the opening of A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense: A Portrait of Robert Fraser. While his name may ring few bells outside of the seasoned London art community, eminent gallerist Robert Fraser, who ran a gallery in London during the Sixties and again in the Eighties, was a seminal part of the Swinging Sixties scene. His notoriety hinged on scandal, parties and friendships with the most famous rock stars of the era, as well as an undeniable talent for spotting art's Next Big Thing. This is the eminent dealer who sold art to Paul McCartney, and hosted John Lennon and Yoko Ono's first joint exhibition; the Savile Row-clad Etonian whose Mayfair galleries attracted the likes of Marlon Brando, Marianne Faithfull and William Burroughs in the 60s and 80s; the silver-tongued heroin addict who introduced Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat to Britain, and was arrested -- and, in his case, imprisoned -- for drug possession with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards during the 1967 Redlands Bust. Curated by the artist Brian Clarke, A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense -- a winking reference to the police report describing the bust -- aims to blend the rebel, the art connoisseur and the hedonist to present a rounded image of an unsung star of the 60s. ""There are oceans of anecdotes by Robert, and some of them are true. But the anecdote isn't enough to convey the kind of energy that he had, this kind of magnetic energy that drew you to him -- or repelled you depending on your own energy,"" says Clarke, arguably the world's most well known stained glass artist. I first met Clarke three weeks before the opening at his spacious cottage-cum-mansion in London's tony Notting Hill neighborhood. A literal portrait of Fraser painted by Basquiat hangs prominently in the living room, surrounded by works by Warhol, Francis Bacon and others. Clarke, who was a close friend of Fraser's and was the first artist exhibited at his 80s gallery, is still finalizing the exhibition selection, but his energy is easy, if a little manic. Harriet Vyner, a long-time friend of Clarke and Fraser, and author of the Fraser biography Groovy Bob: The Life and Times of Robert Fraser, has been collaborating with him on the catalog. She's on hand to add her own anecdotes to the ocean. ""I remember going to Seditionaries, (Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's 70s punk shop) on the King's Road, and it felt a bit scary, but that was part of the thrill,"" she says.

"Ronny Deila will use international week to scout for Celtic signings but he and his spies are more likely to be spotted at Under-21 or national youth team games than a Euro 2016 qualifier over the next 10 days. Deila wants his club to gain a standing in world football on a par with Ajax for their development and production of young talent. That, he says, will enable Celtic to tempt the elite young stars in European football to Scotland. The Celtic manager’s goal is to close out this season with a domestic Treble, then make the additions capable of helping the squad through the Champions League qualifying rounds. However, it is unlikely that Deila will be throwing a few million pounds to secure any eye-catching signing that would raise supporter expectations ahead of that late summer campaign. Ronny Deila (centre) wants to implement the same youth production standards as Ajax in the future . He explained: ‘We will bring in players but I think we will bring in younger players to build the next generation behind the current one. ‘If we are going to fight with the best clubs in Europe for the best 22-year-olds, then you can forget it. No chance. The only chance we have to get a world-class player is to go to 16/17-year-olds and say: “You will train with the first team”. ‘That’s our chance to get a player in. We have to find some very big talents that can be the best ones. The Celtic boss will use the international break as an opportunity to scout potential younger talent . Celtic have a great chance of completing a domestic treble and thrashed Dundee United once again . ‘We have to think younger and give them the chance to get in the squad and train with the best ones. ‘Ajax get it because they have an unbelievable reputation — and we have to build, over the years, a reputation. That if you come to Celtic, you see what is happening, you get sold to the big clubs and you get a good development.’ Deila helped Real Madrid wonder kid Martin Odegaard on to early stardom by handing him his first- team debut at 15 in Norway. While Celtic would not stand a chance of tempting him to Scotland when Spanish, German or English giants are scrapping for his signature, Deila believes less precocious talent than Odegaard can be mined then nurtured into better long-term prospects under him. ‘There are players there, maybe not at Odegaard level, but close,’ said Deila. ‘With a good development, they can be past Odegaard if he makes the wrong decisions and we make the right ones.’ Deila played a vital role in Martin Odegaard's rise to stardom when he was Stromsgodset manager .

Ronny Deila will use international week to scout for Celtic signings but he and his spies are more likely to be spotted at Under-21 or national youth team games than a Euro 2016 qualifier over the next 10 days. Deila wants his club to gain a standing in world football on a par with Ajax for their development and production of young talent. That, he says, will enable Celtic to tempt the elite young stars in European football to Scotland.","

"(CNN)A term used by President Barack Obama and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to characterize rioters has given new life to a debate over the word ""thug."" ""Of course it's not the right word, to call our children 'thugs,'"" Baltimore City Councilman Carl Stokes told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""These are children who have been set aside, marginalized, who have not been engaged by us. No, we don't have to call them thugs."" ""Just call them n-----s. Just call them n-----s,"" he said. ""No, we don't have to call them by names such as that."" The Rev. Jamal Bryant drew the same comparison Wednesday morning on CNN. The President and the mayor are wrong, he said. ""These are not thugs, these are upset and frustrated children."" ""It's amazing. You don't call six police officers who kill a man without probable cause 'thugs,' but children who are frustrated and don't have an outlet, you call them 'thugs.' 'Thugs' is the 21st century word for the n-word. And it is repulsive and it is offensive to every person who is a parent trying to raise children interpreting what's taking place in this hour."" The recent unrest in Baltimore was sparked by the arrest and death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in custody. Six officers have been suspended over the incident. Bryant delivered the eulogy at Gray's funeral. What we know, don't know about Freddie Gray's death . Mayor Rawlings-Blake responded Wednesday. ""I wanted to clarify my comments on 'thugs,'"" she wrote Wednesday on Twitter. ""When you speak out of frustration and anger, one can say things in a way that you don't mean."" She added, ""That night we saw misguided young people who need to be held accountable, but who also need support. And my comments then didn't convey that."" Kweisi Mfume, Baltimore native and former president of the NAACP, said, ""It's important we not shift the focus into something that has absolutely nothing to do with poverty, despair, hunger, homelessness and a sense of not belonging."" ""Whether we call them a thug, a law breaker, a juvenile delinquent, it really doesn't matter. What matters is how do we take back our streets. And that's what men have been doing, going around, talking to these young men where they, are in their face, and letting them know, you can't control this community. It is not yours. You can't burn it down. You can't force people out. You can't threaten people,"" he told ""OutFront."" ""So I understand that, that people want to talk about a word. But I'm more worried about a movement, and it's not necessarily a movement for positive change. It's a movement for negative change right now unless we get it under control."" Kevin Shird, another Baltimore native and author of ""Lessons of Redemption,"" said ""thug"" is ""not like the n-word in my mind."" But, he said in a CNN interview, the term has ""been racialized across America, so I can see why people would become offended like that."" Shird, a former drug dealer, also said he

"(CNN)The Arizona police officer who intentionally slammed his car into an armed suspect previously faced an excessive force lawsuit in New York, according to court documents. Officer Michael Rapiejko was with the New York Police Department from 2003 to 2006. Two years after he left, he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that Rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest. The lawsuit said Luis Colon had parked his car and gotten out when Rapiejko, with his gun aimed at Colon, ordered him back into the car. During his arrest on charges of obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Colon alleged he was yanked from the car, handcuffed and choked. The charges against Colon were dropped six months later. Colon also sued two unnamed officers who arrived after the initial confrontation, court documents show. Colon and the city settled the suit for $20,000. The settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing . Rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006, and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the NYPD, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. The NYPD has said that it will not release further details about Rapiejko. Rapiejko's actions in Marana, Arizona, in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer, have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer for the February incident. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's ""New Day"" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. ""That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,"" Rozema said. ""So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,"" the chief added. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a nearby Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Rapiejko's camera shows the officer's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. ""We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,"" Rozema said. ""And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy

"Maverick Tottenham forward Emmanuel Adebayor has insisted that he is happy to stay and fight for his place at White Hart Lane and rejected reports linking him with a move away. Taking to Twitter on Tuesday night, the 31-year-old Togo international expressed his gratitude at being able to play in the Premier League and labeled the division 'the best in the world.' Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer.

Adebayor gives an underwhelming performance against League One side Sheffield United in the League Cup . The striker's significantly more modest form since then, however, coupled with the meteoric rise of homegrown star Harry Kane, have left Adebayor little more than a bit-part in the Spurs machine. This season, he has made just 16 appearances in all competitions, scoring only twice and has been criticised for several underwhelming performances, in particular his showing against League One's Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Yet, the former Arsenal, Real Madrid and Manchester City hitman remains adamant that he will see out the remainder of his contract in north London. Adebayor's last Premier League goal for Spurs came during a 1-2 defeat by Newcastle back in October last year. Adebayor has made just 10 appearances in all competitions this season and scored only twice . Adebayor might be deemed surplus to requirements due to the breakthrough of homegrown star Harry Kane .

"Taken during the twilight hours, a British photographer has gone to extraordinary lengths to get the perfect shot including climbing rooftops, hanging from helicopters and even entering restricted military areas. And Paul Reiffer's dedication to his work has enabled him to put together a portfolio showcasing the beauty of some of the world's most famous cities by night. Each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails. Scroll down for video . City snapper, Paul Reiffer, 34, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes, including this of Tower Bridge in London . The winding bridges of Yanan East Interchange in Shanghai are portrayed beautifully in the collection . Reiffer, 34, from Weymouth, Dorset, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes and has visited some of the world's most iconic landmarks in the process. Whether it is the bright lights of the New York City skyline, the winding bridges of Shanghai, or the wispy reflections of Singapore's harbour, each of Paul's photographs reveal a beautiful side to the urban sprawl. By using a specially adapted camera that shoots at a whopping 80 mega pixels per image, the British photographer is able to capture huge city landscapes in extraordinary detail. Constantly on the move, Paul is continuously travelling in an effort to add new locations to his already impressive portfolio. Then New York city skyline is perhaps one of the more noticeable landscapes from Reiffer's work . Behind the scenes of Pauls shoot in Shanghai; the photographer has spent three years collating his work . Each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails; here the lights of Sydney Harbour reflect in the waters . Paul said: 'Some of my images require a lot of planning, unfortunately, one of the ways I decided to get a different view was to get onto rooftops. 'Some with full permissions and authorised access, others less so. 'Ironically, while legitimate access takes a lot of bureaucracy, it's the more 'unofficial' shoots which take the most planning. 'Generally if you search online, or see a city in a magazine, the same old shots will appear time and time again, so while I use other images for reference, I tend to then start researching using tools like Google satellite view and 3D maps along with sunrise/sunset apps to plan my own take on the view of a city. The serene and still waters reflect the bright lights of Singapore, a hive of activity . A gorgeous sunset of the golden gate bridge, San Francisco reveals a beautiful side to the urban sprawl . The roads may be devoid of traffic here in Kuala Lumpur, but it simply gives the light trails more prominence .

"A teacher who was suspended for allowing her class to write 'get well soon' letters to a convicted police killer claims the children wanted to send notes to him. Marilyn Zuniga sparked outrage for allowing her third grade class in Orange, New Jersey, to pen letters to murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal, after he collapsed in the bathroom of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. Abu-Jamal, 60, is serving a life sentence in prison after he shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in cold blood in 1981. Marilyn Zuniga apologised after she allowed her students to write to convicted police killer Mumia Abu-Jamal after he became ill while serving a life sentence in prison, but said the students wanted to write to him . Ms Zuniga has apologised for publicising the efforts of her pupils online, but said they had wanted to write to Abu-Jamal, according to philly.com. Both her pupils and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union wrote to the killer. Ms Zuniga spoke at the Orange school board after she was suspended from her position while officials investigate. She explained that she had previously asked her class to consider Abu-Jamal's quote 'So long as one just person is silenced, there is no justice.' She said when she told students the former Black Panther was ill, they had asked to write to him in prison. Ms Zuniga told the board she had made a mistake and was prepared to resign rather than be fired, to prevent damage to her career. Mumia's supporters say photos of the killer eleased this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is . Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . The letters caused many to criticize the actions of the teacher. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. He previously told Fox News: 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Abu Jamal was sentenced to life in prison after he shot Mr Faulkner in the back and then, once he was dead, in between the eyes. Abu-Jamal shot dead Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, shooting him at first in the back . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death for the killing, but this was overturned in 2012. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels which may be linked to diabetes. The killer's supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Johanna Fernandez, a professor of history at Baruch College who delivered the letters said they had made Abu-Jamal 'smile' and

"Reggie Bush will head back to his native California to fill the Frank Gore-sized hole in the 49ers backfield. The 30-year-old was cut by Detroit after two mixed years; the first inspired, the second injury-hit. ESPN first reported the deal after Bush opted not to join the New England Patriots. Concerns about fitness will plague the running back but when healthy he adds a threat on the ground and in the air. Reggie Bush trains with the Lions ahead of their game with the Atlanta Falcons in London last year . The 2005 Heisman Trophy winner was drafted second overall in the 2006 draft by the Saints. His five seasons in New Orleans yielded 33 touchdowns in 60 games and a Super Bowl victory. Bush moved to Miami Dolphins in 2011. He rushed for 2,072 yards, scoring 15 touchdowns over two seasons before joining the Lions in 2013. After going 8-8 and dispensing with Jim Harbaugh's services, the 49ers have undergone something of a facelift in the offseason. After a botched interview with Adam Gase, Jim Tomsula was promoted from defensive co-ordinator to head coach. And his short stint has seen the retirement of linebacker Patrick Willis, the loss of guard Mike Iupati to NFC West rivals Arizona and long-term staple Gore leave for Philadelphia. Cornerback Perrish Cox also departed to sign a bumper $15million three-year deal with Tennessee. The 49ers have added wide receiver Torrey Smith and defensive end Darnell Dockett and re-signed cornerback Chris Cook, as well as adding former rugby league sensation Jarryd Hayne to the roster.

"New Delhi, India (CNN)Do not generalize India as a country of rapists. That was the firm message from the German ambassador in New Delhi after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male Indian student's application for an internship due to the South Asian nation's ""rape problem."" Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger never did such a thing, according to her and the University of Leipzig. The university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from India; while it wasn't clear how many of them were men, the university said 29 of its 44 Indian students total are male. Still, Beck-Sickinger has admitted making a mistake by engaging the rejected intern candidate with talk about rape in Indian society and how the issue spurred ""many (other) female professors in Germany (have) decided to no longer accept male Indian students for these reasons."" ""It was never my intention to make a defamatory comment about Indian society,"" she said, according to a statement posted on the website of the University of Leipzig. ""I do not have anything against Indian students -- on the contrary. I sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings I may have hurt."" Marital rape: Why is it legal in India? The firestorm began with a recent post on the social-networking site Quora. It featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the University of Leipzig's biochemistry department. They fell under this provocative headline: ""What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?"" The post didn't identify Beck-Sickinger, blacking out the name of the emails' author. But it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her: ""Unfortunately I don't accept any Indian male students for internships. We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in the group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support."" The thing is, Beck-Sickinger says she ""never wrote"" such a message, claiming this email was ""put together from individual segments taken from different mails."" ""I do not reject students because of reasons of race or gender, "" she added. ""I am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way."" Here's what the University of Leipzig says did happen: The professor told the candidate ""the laboratories are fully occupied."" The Indian applicant ""didn't accept"" this rejection, the university says, and went back-and-forth with Beck-Sickinger over email. During that exchange, Beck-Sickinger wrote things that she later regretted -- excerpts of which were posted to Quora and the university acknowledged as legitimate. Speaking about how Indian men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country, she said, ""I fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals. However it is also unbelievable that the Indian society is not able to solve this problem for many years now."" India bans rape documentary . Beck-Sickinger

"A firm which declared that the South of England harboured as much oil as the North Sea has been forced to backtrack on its ‘wild claims’. Last week, UK Oil & Gas Investments (UKOG) boasted it had discovered a ‘world class potential resource’ beneath the Home Counties. The oil exploration company claimed analysis of a well near Gatwick Airport suggested 100 billion barrels of oil lay beneath the Weald Basin, covering Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Kent. UK Oil & Gas Investments has backtracked on its claims the UK could be sitting on an oil reserve larger than what has been extracted from the North Sea and Kuwait. Above, the company's test oil well at Horse Hill . Sceptics immediately queried the bold claims – as the Daily Mail reported – but UKOG’s millionaire chairman David Lenigas insisted at the time that the oil would create thousands of jobs, saying: ‘If you own a farm or land in the Weald, there’s a pretty good chance there’s a bucket-load of oil under there.’ Now the firm has been forced into an embarrassing U-turn, admitting that it cannot be sure how much crude lies beneath the region – if, indeed, there is much at all. UKOG and a consortium of other oil firms hold a licence for just 55 square miles in Surrey and Sussex, a tiny fraction of the Weald Basin. But after finding oil in the area, it scaled up its findings across the whole 1,100-square mile Weald area. The company has now admitted that its estimates were based on findings made in a 55-square-mile stretch of the basin, less than two per cent of the total surface area . A map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the Weald Basin, which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground . It claimed the entire region was rich with the fossil fuel, sparking hopes it had uncovered ‘Britain’s Dallas’. Yesterday, after being instructed to give more details by the London Stock Exchange, it issued a ‘clarification’, admitting the oil should not yet be considered as ‘prospective resources or reserves’. It said further drilling and well testing was needed before it could say how much oil existed on its own site – let alone surrounding areas – and what could be recovered from the ground. David Lenigas has been criticised on the past for exaggerating his companies' successes to drive up share prices . Even then, it seems unlikely it could estimate how much lies beneath the whole region, adding: ‘The company has not undertaken work outside its licence areas sufficient to comment on the possible OIP (oil in place) in either the approximate 1,100 square miles or the whole of the Weald Basin.’ Brenda Pollack, of Friends of the Earth, said: ‘UKOG has backtracked on the wild claims it made last week and admitted that it has no idea how much oil is under the Sussex Weald. ‘This is yet another example of the potential for shale oil and gas being overhyped by an industry

"A terminally ill bride has been granted her dying wish of a dream wedding after being given just six weeks to live. Natalie Price, of Redditch, Worcestershire, planned her big day in just 20 days after being told her lung disease, which also claimed the life of her mother, was terminal on March 6. The mother-of-two, whose eight-year-old son Bradley has just been diagnosed with the same condition - fibrosing alveolitis - and her partner of 11 years, Andy, planned the wedding to ensure they had a fairy tale wedding. A thrilled Natalie and Andy Price hold their marriage certificate after organising their wedding in just 20 days . Natalie and Andy celebrate their big day with sons Callum (on her immediate left) and Bradley, right, as family and friends look on . Andy sprang into action along with family and friends to make it happen. And yesterday Natalie enjoyed her dream wedding day as she married her long-term sweetheart in front of family and friends. 'I'm so happy to have finally married Andy,' Natalie, who lost her ten-week-old baby daughter, Paige, to cot death, said. 'Our wedding day was the best day of my life.' Now the 30-year-old has just one more bucket list wish - to raise enough money to send her two sons, Callum, 11, and Bradley to Disneyland Florida after she dies to take their mind off the pain of losing their mum. Andy, 48, said he was determined that Natalie would have the dream wedding she always wanted. 'Natalie and I have been together for 11-years and we are soul mates. We'd always wanted to get married but we just never got round to planning it. Natalie's father, William Bradley, walks her down the aisle while the guests wait inside . The couple said they had always planned to marry after being together for 11 years . 'After ten months of regular scans and X-rays to monitor Natalie’s health we were told the devastating news that she had declined rapidly and had just six weeks to live. We knew from that moment we needed to act fast. 'Our wedding day was the best day of our lives, it was perfect in every way - I just wish I could have my wife for longer than just a few short weeks. 'It was mine and Natalie’s dream to get married and thanks to our family, friends Lisa Dorgan and Laurence Walsh, and local businesses, we were able to fulfil that wish before it was too late. 'It breaks my heart to think about the future without her but I need to stay strong for our boys. 'Seeing Natalie come down the aisle in her dress allowed me to forget all the heartbreak for just a minute.

"A freshman basketball player with rare brain cancer who made it through full season despite being given only a few months to live is now having problems swallowing as her condition worsens. During her senior year of high school, Lauren Hill was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent. But she still made it through a full season at the Cincinnati university while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor she has. Scroll down for video . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19 (pictured), made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . Her mother Lisa updates her followers on her Facebook page about her daughter's progress and said this week that Lauren was having trouble swallowing, although her humor and bravery are shining through. She posted: 'Lauren sleeps about 12 hours a day and still does not like to take naps. 'Her appetite is not as big as it use to be. She has been having increased issues with swallowing. We had to add some thickener to her water to make it easier to swallow. Food we cut down into bite sizes these days to prevent chocking.' Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . She said her daughter's pain medication has been increased to help her deal with headaches and aches across her body. She added: 'She still has a sense of humor even if her legs give out and she falls. My favorite quote of the week.... ""I didn't fall, I gracefully assaulted the floor."" Got to love her.' Despite the diagnosis, Hill decided to attend college and play for the Division III school. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The Team: The Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team (pictured) held its postseason banquet in a hospital room with Hill . The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead

Melissa Liddle, 23, was found dead at the house she shared with Anthony Ross, 24, and her two sons in South Shields, South Tyneside, on Sunday evening.

Ross was arrested and charged with her murder and appeared at court yesterday . Officers and paramedics were called to her home at about 8.10pm on Mother's Day but she was pronounced dead at the scene. A 48-year-old was originally arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender but police have said he faces no further action. Miss Liddle, who had two sons aged five and seven months and was a volunteer for St John's Ambulance, has been described as a 'loving and caring person'.

'Hopefully this will mean they can do some nice things that will take their minds off losing their mum. 'My uncle said to me that he was proud of me for doing this because it reminded him of Melissa as this would be something that she would of done.' She added: 'The family are so proud and they would like to thank everyone who has donated and will thank them properly at the right time.

They are taking each day as it comes.' The case was referred to Newcastle Crown Court and Ross was remanded in custody until the next hearing on March 19.

"Producers working on the remake of the Oscar-winning Ben Hur have been barred from shooting the epic chariot scene at the Circus Maximus. Filmmakers already on location in Rome and the southern city of Matera reportedly made a request to use the ancient stadium immortalised by the film in December. But it was feared the decision to bring hundreds of extras and heavy vehicles into a fragile archaeological site would lead to public outcry. The Circus Maximus (pictured) is an ancient site in Rome once used for the empire's deadly chariot races. Here it is pictured when it hosted the Live 8 concert in 2005 . The Circus Maximus was capable of holding hundreds of thousands of spectators during the chariot races . However, archaeologists said filming at the ancient site would cause 'irreparable damage' to the famous site . The rent of the ancient ground as a set for two weeks would have netted one million euros for the city’s cash-strapped coffers, Corriere della Sera reported. The classic chariot race scene - in which Ben Hur played by Charlton Heston competes against his nemesis Massala - will now be filmed in a purpose-built reproduction arena in Rome’s Cinecittà studios. The Circus Maximus was the centre of a row last summer when the Rolling Stones were allowed to use it for a concert. Heritage experts said the decision to allow 65,000 music fans to rampage over the area would cause irreparable damage to a ‘very fragile’ site. The millionaire rock band were charged just €8,000. The original 1959 Ben Hur film saw Charlton Heston filmed at the Circus Maximus in the movie's epic chariot race finale (pictured) The ancient arena has been used for pop concerts in the past with Genesis and Lady Gaga playing there in recent years. Bob Geldof's Live 8 concert was held there in 2005. But the site is currently under restoration. Archeologists have continued to discover Roman artefacts including ancient coins, wheels and saucepans as well as the remains of ancient taverns. A spokesman for the Ministry for Cultural Affairs said it was investigating.

"A Massachusetts police department was forced to pay a $500 Bitcoin ransom to hackers who encrypted vital records on their computer network. Tewksbury Police Department came under attack by criminals who infected their network with a form of Internet malware in December before demanding money to decrypt the files. The program called CryptoLocker infects through an e-mail and then scrambles the data on the computer. It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier. Tewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in Bitcoinransom . The only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the Boston Globe. 'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could. 'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort' The department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files. Police became aware of the malware infection the following day. Computers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan. It is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier. CryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. CryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. Computers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads. According to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. When a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency. After this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom. As Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach. 'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier. Tewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of

"Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women. According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to 'relax their vigilance over food', and to always 'remind' themselves: 'You don’t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.' Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website. Scroll down for video . Pseudo-science? Gwyneth Paltrow's (left) osteopath Vicky Vlachonis (right) has written a 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' guide for Goop, in which she encourages a laundry list of food restrictions . Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.' But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece – such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet – have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop’s advice. 'Although not as ""sexy"" as ""anti-inflammatory diets"" and ""magical cures"", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website’s top tips. And when it came to Ms Vlachonic’s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a ‘magical cure’ for morning sickness – while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation – Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims. 'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.' Glowing: In keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, Ms Vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid 'dairy, rich fatty meats, peanut butter, wheat and sugar'. Pictured, Ms Paltrow pregnant with her daughter Apple in 2004 . Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages. 'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber. 'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'. She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion

"Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called ""Princess."" ""Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot,"" said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. ""Nobody fills that boot now."" Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, ""a jolly soul,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: ""Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love."" ""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye,"" Pellegrini told the jury. ""And that is the very essence of terror."" Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. ""These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return,"" Pellegrini said.

"(CNN)North Korea accused Mexico of illegally holding one of its cargo ships Wednesday and demanded the release of the vessel and crew. The ship, the Mu Du Bong, was detained after it ran aground off the coast of Mexico in July. Mexico defended the move Wednesday, saying it followed proper protocol because the company that owns the ship, North Korea's Ocean Maritime Management company, has skirted United Nations sanctions. ""Because the company has avoided the sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council, the Mexican government is acting on the basis of its international obligations as a responsible U.N. member state,"" the Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations said. The Security Council blacklisted Ocean Maritime Management in July, saying it ""played a key role in arranging the shipment of concealed arms and related materiel"" on another ship, the Chong Chon Gang, which was detained by Panama in 2013. But An Myong Hun, North Korea's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said there was no reason to hold the Mu Du Bong and accused Mexico of violating the crew members' human rights by keeping them from their families. ""Mu Du Bong is a peaceful, merchant ship and it has not shipped any items prohibited by international laws or regulations,"" An told reporters at the United Nations headquarters Wednesday. ""And we have already paid full compensation to Mexican authorities according to its domestic laws."" According to Mexico's U.N. mission, the 33 North Korean nationals who make up the vessel's crew are free, staying at a hotel in the port city of Tuxpan and regularly visiting the ship to check on it. They will soon be sent back to North Korea with help from the country's embassy, Mexican authorities said. In the case of the Chong Chon Gang, Panamanian authorities found it was carrying undeclared weaponry from Cuba -- including MiG fighter jets, anti-aircraft systems and explosives -- buried under thousands of bags of sugar. Panama seized the cargo and held onto the ship and its crew for months. North Korea eventually agreed to pay a fine of $666,666 for the vessel's release. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

"Passengers and crew faced mid-air panic on board an Air Europa charter flight after several travellers fainted while en route to Tel Aviv from Barcelona, according to reports. After landing at Ben Gurion Airport this morning passengers told Israeli media that flight attendants were 'hysterical', there was a strong smell of 'gas' in the cabin during the four-hour journey, and 10 people lost consciousness. One passenger told Israeli news website Ynet: ‘They did not let people get up in the bathroom because they were afraid more people would faint.’ Passengers told Israeli media that 10 people fainted during an Air Europa flight from Barcelona to Tel Aviv . In a statement, an Air Europa spokesperson said passengers were feeling dizzy, but did not faint, after noticing a smell that was believed to be kerosene, which powers the jet's engines. The spokesperson said: 'Around 6 people had temporary indisposition this morning travelling from Barcelona to Tel Aviv on flight Air Europa UX433. 'All of them have recovered quickly by drinking a cola drink. All passengers left the aircraft on their own at destination.' Almost 200 passengers and crew were on board the Boeing 737, leased from a company called Flying Carpet, when the situation unfolded. A passenger named Hilla told Ynet that people on board smelled 'gas' after the pilot started the engines while preparing for take-off in Barcelona. She said she complained to cabin crew but was told that everything was 'OK' and not to worry. An hour later, passengers began to lose consciousness, causing people on board to panic, she claimed. Over the plane’s tannoy a flight attendant reportedly asked if there was a doctor on board to assess the passengers. An Air Europa passenger said people splashed water on her to wake her up after she fainted (file photo) One woman who fainted regained consciousness after water was poured on her, but said she soon lost consciousness a second time after feeling dizzy. She told Ynet that she began to feel weak after the person sitting next to her adjusted the air conditioning control above their seat. The woman said: ‘[They] woke me up with water, and after a few minutes I passed out again. 'Stewards were under pressure … and [would] not even let us go to the bathroom.’ The Air Europa spokesperson said there is 'no gas of any type' on the new generation of Boeing 737 aircraft, so the smell perceived by some passengers came from jet fuel. The spokesperson said: ‘The smell of kerosene that some people perceived during flight is normal when the engines are started with headwind, but after short period of time that smell is always removed by the air conditioning system.’ The spokesperson said no emergency was declared and the flight landed as scheduled. An official from Israel's Ministry of Transport said Spanish authorities are investigating. A spokesman for Israel Airports Authority told MailOnline Travel that he was not made aware of any incident on board the plane. He said the flight crew did not say anything about ill passengers while communicating

"Ukip’s Suzanne Evans today said she will step in as party leader if Nigel Farage quits because of ill health. Mr Farage has revealed that he is suffering from a recurring spinal injury that means he is on medication and making twice weekly hospital visits. The Ukip leader has also pledged to be 'gone within 10 minutes' if he fails to win in Thanet South where he is standing to become an MP. Scroll down for video . Stepping into the breach: The party's deputy chairman Suzanne Evans (pictured right) said she would step in as leader if Mr Farage (left) is forced to pull out due to ill health. But she played down his medical problems . Asked what she would do if Mr Farage asked her to 'carry on the mantle', Miss Evans today told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'Well if he said that to me, of course I would, yes. 'But he’s going to win and I cannot wait to see him in the House of Commons, he will really shake things up, it is a very exciting prospect.' Miss Evans, who is the party's deputy chairman, down-played Mr Farage's medical problems. She added: 'His health is fine, his health is absolutely fine and whilst Nigel is leader he has my 100% support. 'He’s a great leader, look what he’s done for this party over 22 years, battered, bruised, physically, verbally, in all manner of ways. He is the man for the job.' In pain: Ukip leader Nigel Farage is suffering from a recurring spinal injury and is on medication . Miss Evans is seen as the party's rising star and has been increasingly tipped as Mr Farage's successor because of strong media performances. She wrote the party's general election manifesto. After the manifesto launch, she was praised for her assured and confident performance and she received Mr Farage’s personal thanks. In January she stepped in as policy chief after Tim Aker quit amid reports he was failing to deliver it on time. Miss Evans, who is a former BBC local radio journalist, works freelance as a PR and marketing consultant and in 2011 founded a health charity for women. In May 2013 she came to prominence when she defected from the Tories to Ukip with a group of councillors in Merton, south London, but she lost her seat in local election last year. She is regularly used by the party for appearances on programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight, and has been fronting the party’s election campaign morning press conferences. But despite increasing talk about her leadership potential, senior Ukip figures privately admit she is unlikely to be elected in Shrewsbury & Atcham, the Shropshire seat where she is standing to become MP. Mr Farage has said it would be difficult for his successor not to have a place in the Commons without the ‘potential for conflict’.

"Amid the horror of a Nazi concentration camp, liberated by the British Army 70 years ago this week, love blossomed against all the odds between an emaciated inmate and one of the soldiers sent to arrest her SS guards. But the love between British soldier, Sergeant Norman Turgel, 24 at the time, and teenage Polish girl Gena, 20, was only kindled because of the generosity and kindness of the camp's British commander Major Leonard Berney. This week survivors and liberators of the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp in northern Germany gathered to commemorate the day British soldiers entered its gates and began the task of saving as many of the 60,000 starving inmates as was possible. Gena and Norman were married two months short of their golden wedding anniversary of 50 years, pictured before his passing in 1995 . Norman Turgel pictured as a young soldier in the British Intelligence Corps in his early 20s (l) and Gena Turgel as a young girl (r) Gena, weighing only a few pounds was, like many others in the camp, a walking skeleton, for whom certain death was only days away. Among the recently dead was Dutch girl Anne Frank whose diaries while hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam became world renowned. But through the striped and filthy prison uniform, Sergeant Norman Turgel of the 53 Field Security section of British Intelligence Corps, spotted an eternal beauty and began talking to her. Before long Norman had fallen in love with the young Jewish girl who at last was being fed proper food and was being given clothes to wear again. Anne Frank, whose diaries of persecution at the hands of the Nazis became the defining account of the Holocaust, was just one of Bergen-Belsen's many victims. Frank was living in the Netherlands when the Nazis seized it in 1940, leaving them trapped. In 1942 they were forced into hiding in secret rooms hidden inside Otto Frank's office building. They spent two years there, but were anonymously betrayed and sent to the concentration camps. Anne, and her sister Margot, were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they died of typhus in February 1945, just months before the Allies liberated it. Bergen-Belsen's SS commandant, the cruel and tyrannical Joseph Kramer, was among those Norman helped to round up and capture. Other soldiers helped hand out fresh bread and fruit. Norman became so besotted with Gena that he told her he was going to marry her one day. But here the story could have ended had it not been for Major Leonard Berney, the new commanding officer of what became Belsen Camp for Displaced Persons. With Norman posted away and other prisoners being repatriated to all parts of Europe, there was a danger of the young lovers being parted forever. Major Leonard Berney, who is now 95, was the commanding officer of liberated Belsen. He played cupid for soldier Norman and Gena. Pictured in uniform (l) and more recently (r) Bergen Belsen was located in northern Germany, south-west of the town of Bergen itself. From 1941 ro 1945 almost 50,000 people were

"A hotel owner believes he has found the perfect solution for revitalising his flagging business - by converting it into a swingers' paradise. Jon Huxley, 46, hopes to cash in on the Fifty Shades of Grey effect and attract guests from the gay and swinging communities at his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent. He plans to install sex swings, bondage rooms and dungeons and have rooms of differing sizes to cater for couples and multiple groups. Jon Huxley, standing outside his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent, is looking at 'developing' his premises to cater for swingers . He hopes the craze in Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as his object of affection Anastasia Steele, can help transform his business. He said: 'We have plans to attract tourists from the gay and swinging community for short breaks and weekends of adult fun. 'Obviously a lot of equipment will need to be installed like swings, bondage rooms, red room of pain and dungeons of delight. 'We would be having these events each weekend and accepting tourist guests during the week. 'Food and drink will be provided as part of an all-inclusive hotel package and it would be a civilised and friendly environment.' Mr Huxley will be hoping to recreate scenes like this from the hit film Fifty Shades of Grey . Clothing will be optional and privacy for our guests will therefore need to be ensured. 'It is not intended to be a seedy or dirty business. It is a respected clientele who enjoy taking their clothes off.' Mr Huxley said he has decided to appeal to the swinging community after rowing with the council over the use of Grade-II listed building. Jon Huxley hopes the change in hotel ethos can see his business grow . For months he had been in a dispute with Shepway District Council over complaints about its use as a house of multiple occupation for homeless people. Councillors voted for an enforcement notice after neighbours complained of anti-social behaviour. Mr Huxley said the complaints had been about anti-social behaviour and noise from the street rather than from inside the property. He said he would not need a council entertainments licence because there would be no live entertainment, loud music or dancing. Asked what locals might think of his plans he said: 'I do not involve myself in what happens behind their closed doors and they should not involve themselves in what happens behind mine. 'I have bills to pay and the income has to come from somewhere. They have seen fit to take away my current source of guests so I have to look for other sources. 'I can't attract tourists because there isn't a market for it anymore and that is a fact I have to deal with.

"Gorkha, Nepal (CNN)The ride from Kathmandu to near the epicenter of Nepal's devastating earthquake is not for those who get easily carsick. Steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where Nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured, in much less than ideal circumstances. The view along the six-hour journey from the capital is deceptive. Although I see numerous landslides, I am surprised that the villages we are driving through are relatively unaffected. During the entire journey, I notice only about 10 collapsed or seriously damaged houses. One of the biggest challenges rescue workers are facing in Nepal is reaching affected people in remote mountainous areas. One of them is Gorkha, a district northwest of Kathmandu. The town we were visiting looks intact. Some houses have cracks, and I see a few collapsed brick walls. Most of the shops and businesses are open. But our first stop at the district hospital brings us into the full reality of the human catastrophe. The hospital campus is overflowing with patients. The facility is simply not big enough to handle such calamity. The injured are not from the town of Gorkha, which lies near the top of one of the numerous mountain ranges. They are from northern part of the district, where some 200,000 people live. To accommodate all the casualties, the hospital built a tarpaulin shelter over the parking lot. At a time of our arrival, there are about 20 patients lying on mattresses on a dusty concrete floor. The youngest is 10, the oldest in his 70s. Most of them have visible wounds: deep cuts, bruised faces, broken arms and legs or spinal injuries. All of their faces with empty looks are still expressing the terror they went through and the pain they are suffering. Mita Gurung, 10, sustained injuries to her face and leg when her house in the village of Sinjung partially collapsed. Her mother was injured in the tremor. Mita is gently tended by volunteer child counselor Tara May Bishakarma. ""I just found what she likes and keep repeating it. Her injuries are fairly superficial, but she is traumatized. It will take some time, but she will recover,"" Bishakarma says. Children usually get excited when being filmed. Mita seems almost unaware of my camera. Little food, less optimism in Kathmandu tent city . The situation in the hospital's emergency room is similar. Every bed is taken. All the injured are taken care of by attentive doctors and nurses. Some have family members with them. Despite the gravity of the situation, the atmosphere here is calm. Gorkha's hospital is ill-equipped to treat more serious injuries and serves mostly as a transit point. Here, the injured get necessary first aid and as soon as possible are transferred to bigger hospitals in other districts or in Kathmandu. There are not enough ambulances, and most of the injured must travel on old buses. People unable to walk are transported on makeshift wooden stretchers. I cannot even imagine traveling on the

"They had earned a trophy and a promising title shot, but there was an appropriate lack of rejoicing by England on Saturday night. Wastefulness is no cause for euphoria. The Calcutta Cup had been retained, but the limitations of the opposition meant that was never in real doubt, despite considerable Scottish tenacity and occasional artistry. Stuart Lancaster, his assistants and his squad know that the standards they reached at Twickenham will not suffice against the leading rugby nations. England beat Scotland but they haven't shown enough to convince yet during the Six Nations . Defeating Scotland earned Chris Robshaw and his men a trophy, but they didn't do enough . The England squad smile for the cameras having defeated Scotland 25-13 to win the Calcutta Cup . 1st minute: George Ford sends Luther Burrell clear but he ignores Anthony Watson in space on the right and the door slams shut. 13th minute: Ben Youngs frees Mike Brown but the full-back — minus a boot — is chased down by Stuart Hogg close to the posts. 15th minute: The pack drive a scrum towards the Scottish line but Billy Vunipola is unable to pick up and touch down. 17th minute: Jack Nowell storms clear with two team-mates on either side but goes it alone, slips and cannot offload the ball. 31st minute: Burrell bursts through and sends Watson scorching to the line, but the ‘try’ is ruled out ny Romain Poite for a forward pass. 54th minute: Rampant England swarm into the visitors’ 22 but the attempted offload by Geoff Parling is pinched by Blair Cowan. 56th minute: Replacement hooker Tom Youngs makes a dazzling midfield charge but it comes to nothing as his pass flies between two supporting runners. 58th minute: Watson breaks from a ruck to the opposition 22 but runs away from Burrell and cannot release the centre to score. 62nd minute: Brown blasts over the Scottish 22 to score, but the ‘try’ is disallowed due to another forward pass in the build-up — this time by James Haskell. While the Red Rose is now planted at the top of the RBS Six Nations table, even shambolic France may be no push-overs in the tournament finale at Twickenham next Saturday if there is not a sharp up-turn in English precision. ‘If you look at the All Blacks, when they create a line break they usually end up scoring,’ said Lancaster. ‘We created 12 line breaks, which is a huge positive because I haven’t seen any team pull Scotland apart like that, but to only come away with three tries is frustrating.

"Police say they have no objections to the late afternoon kick-off for Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford. With plenty at stake for both United and City – both sides are challenging for a top-four spot in the Premier League – some may feel that the 4pm start could be unwise as it allows supporters more time in the pub. However, the man in charge of patrolling the sell-out clash has no such fears. Police say they have no objections to Sunday's Manchester derby taking place in the late afternoon . Chief Superintendent John O'Hare says the kick-off was agreed by all parties and revealed that the decision is down to good behaviour from supporters of each side. 'We have not objected to the 4pm kick-off time at all,' he told Sportsmail. 'That 4pm has been agreed is testament to the excellent behaviour of the overwhelming majority of fans who have attended previous derby fixtures. 'It is the positive behaviour of both sets of fans at previous derby fixtures that means we feel confident this Sunday’s fixture will continue that tradition of the fixture being a safe and enjoyable one.' Rio Ferdinand was hit by an object thrown from the crowd during the Manchester derby in December 2012 . In February, Merseyside Police launched a legal challenge after the Everton v Liverpool match, which was also televised, was chosen for a 5.30pm start although they later withdrew their objection. Police in Manchester have met representatives from supporters groups representing each club and agreed a series of measures. Inside the ground fans in and close to the away end will be limited to two drinks every time they visit the bar. No street drinking will be allowed while police will also be searching supporters and keeping an eye out for pyrotechnics. GMP also say they have no intention to hold back City supporters at the final whistle but add that this could be reviewed on the day. Footage on You Tube showed the unrest when United played City in a late kick-off at Wembley in 2011 . City won that FA Cup semi-final, but 34 arrests were made due to crowd trouble outside the stadium . The last time United and City met in a late kick-off for a weekend match was in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in 2011. That clash, won by City 1-0, started at 5.15pm and was marred by a series of skirmishes on Wembley Way and on coach parks close to the stadium with 34 arrests made amid scenes some fans described as 'a free for all'. The last late afternoon kick-off in Manchester was for a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford in 2004. After November's derby at the Etihad Stadium, won 1-0 by City, video footage captured dozens of fans fighting outside a nearby pub around 90 minutes after the final whistle. In April 2012, Vincent Kompany's header settled the derby in a match that was played on a Monday night at the Etihad Stadium.

"Mert Tanay has been banned from driving for three years after he was caught speeding at 124mph on the M20 with his six-year-old son as passenger . A reckless father sped along a crowded motorway at 142mph as his six-year-old son sat terrified in the passenger seat. Mert Tanay weaved in and out of traffic in his powerful BMW 323 and even failed to realise he had sped past a police car that had been chasing another speeding vehicle on the M20 at Harrietsham, Kent. Police chased the 26-year-old for 10 miles to catch him and when he pulled over officers said his son looked terrified and was shaking in the passenger seat. Tanay had told police he was driving at such speed because he was 'distracted' thinking about his forthcoming wedding in six months time. The incident took place on September 28, Canterbury Crown Court heard. Tanay has been banned from driving for three years. He was eventually stopped by police after being seen speeding on the coastbound carriageway near Harrietsham. Alex Rooke, prosecuting, said: 'He was driving so fast as to be considered dangerous, well in excess of 100 miles per hour. 'According to the officer his speed was excessive on what was a crowded motorway. 'He showed little regard for the welfare of his passenger and other road users for a prolonged spell of driving.' At one point Tanay was clocked at 141.6 mph as he tore along the coastbound carriageway last September. Scroll down for video . He admitted dangerous driving and was banned for three years and ordered to carry out 50 hours unpaid work. Tanay, of Enfield, Middlesex, was also ordered to take an extended driving test to retain his licence by Judge Nigel van der Bijl . Defending Paul Hogben said: 'Thankfully there was no accident, injuries or damage but he is a man with a full-time job and is due to be married at the end of this month.' Police speed cameras captured Tanay speeding at 140mph as he tore past them in his powerful BMW . Kent Police have released a video of the chase as a warning to other motorists. Sergeant Chris Wade said: 'The speed and manner of Mert Tanay's driving in this case showed a complete disregard for the safety of other road users, not to mention that of his young passenger who looked very shaken by his experience. 'Tanay's actions on what is a busy motorway fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver. 'Educating drivers in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on Kent's roads is a vitally important part of our role.'

"Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck has pulled out of the England squad because of a knee injury he suffered in Friday's 4-0 win over Lithuania. Welbeck sustained the injury in the second half of the victory at Wembley and was replaced in the 77th minute. The Football Association confirmed on Saturday that Welbeck had been sent back to Arsenal. Danny Welbeck has been sent back to Arsenal after picking up a knee injury in England's win over Lithuania . Welbeck scored England's second in the 4-0 win but will not be present for the friendly against Italy in Turin . The striker will therefore not take part in Tuesday's friendly against Italy in Turin. The FA also confirmed Raheem Sterling, James Milner and Leighton Baines had been sent back to their clubs. Liverpool forward Sterling is carrying a toe injury and Manchester City midfielder Milner did not play against Lithuania as he had a knee problem. Baines has gone back to Everton as Roy Hodgson wants to give Kieran Gibbs his seventh cap in Turin. The England manager has called up Southampton's Ryan Bertrand as cover for the Arsenal defender. Raheem Sterling has also returned to his squad after carrying a toe injury against Lithuania on Friday . Manchester City midfielder James Milner has left and did not play against Lithuania as he has a knee problem . Leighton Baines has gone back to Everton as Roy Hodgson wants to give Kieran Gibbs a cap in Turin . Hodgson told FA TV: 'We knew we were going to be losing Raheem Sterling who had an injection last night on an on-going injury and hopefully that will help him as we go forward. 'We have a problem with James Milner who had to leave, we decided to let Leighton Baines go home and of course we lost Danny Welbeck who unfortunately picked up a slight knee injury (against Lithuania). 'So those four players won't be with us going forward but it means a chance for the other guys in the squad to show what they can do. 'We are going to bring Ryan Bertrand in because with Leighton Baines gone we are now left with only one recognised left-back which is Kieran Gibbs and we wanted two recognised left-backs for both games.' Ryan Bertrand (right) has been called up from Southampton as cover after Baines left Hodgson's squad . Nine players have withdrawn from the squad since it was announced. Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Fraser Forster and Danny Rose all pulled out through injury last week. That means Hodgson has just 17 outfield players to choose from for the game against the country that beat England in their World Cup opener in Manaus last June. Harry Kane scored against Lithuania but is one of just 17 fit outfield players for England to use against Italy .

"A new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases, it has emerged. An official source told The Associated Press that the U.S. Secret Service will conduct drone flights between 1am and 4am over the coming weeks in restricted airspace over Washington D.C. During missions, agents will look at how to interfere with rogue consumer-level drones, which commonly carry video cameras but are powerful enough to carry small amounts of explosives. The challenge for the Secret Service is quickly detecting a rogue drone flying near the White House or the president's location, then within moments either hacking it to seize control over its flight or jamming its signal to send it off course or make it crash. Growing trend: A new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases, it has emerged . The Secret Service has said only that it will openly test drones over Washington, but it declined to provide details such as when it will fly, how many drones, over what parts of the city, for how long and for what purposes. It decided to tell the public in advance about the tests out of concern that people who saw the drones might be alarmed, particularly in the wake of the drones spotted recently over Paris at night. Flying overnight also diminishes the chances that radio jamming would accidentally affect nearby businesses, drivers, pedestrians and tourists. It is illegal under the U.S. Communications Act to sell or use signal jammers except for narrow purposes by government agencies. Depending on a drone's manufacturer and capabilities, its flight-control and video-broadcasting systems commonly use the same common radio frequencies as popular Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies. Jamming by the Secret Service - depending on how powerfully or precisely it works - could disrupt nearby Internet networks or phone conversations until it's turned off. Testing in the real-world environment around the White House would reveal unexpected effects on jamming efforts from nearby buildings, monuments or tall trees. Signals emanating from an inbound drone - such as coming from a video stream back to its pilot - could allow the Secret Service to detect and track it. Federal agencies generally need approval to jam signals from the U.S. telecommunications advisory agency, the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Found: The recreational drone that landed on the White House South Lawn is seen in this U.S. Secret Service handout . That agency declined to tell the AP whether the Secret Service sought permission because it said such requests are not routinely made public. The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed it formally authorized the Secret Service to fly the drones and granted it a special waiver to fly them over Washington. The agency declined to provide specifics about the secret program. In January, a wayward quadcopter drone, piloted by an off-duty U.S. intelligence employee, landed on the White House lawn. At the time, the Secret Service said the errant landing appeared to be accidental and was

"Examining an ultrasound scan of your unborn child is a nerve-racking moment for most parents. But any worries that Ed and Dee Parsons may have harboured quickly faded when they saw their baby in the womb at 20 weeks. The child was making an unmistakable V-sign – the victory gesture associated with Winston Churchill and, latterly, with world peace. The baby formed a V symbol with its tiny fingers while in mother Dee Parson's womb during a scan . ‘The sonographer couldn't believe it – she said she had never seen anything like it before,’ said Mrs Parsons, 35. ‘It’s nice to have such an iconic image of peace when there’s so much unrest all around us. It was very reassuring. She said she and her husband, also 35, were feeling weighed down by negative global events and the death of someone close to them. ‘We were thinking, we’re bringing this child into the world at such a horrible time,’ she added. ‘But then this happened, we couldn’t quite believe what we were seeing. 'All our friends said they thought it was such a positive, happy symbol.’ The couple, who live in Godalming, Surrey, and run an event production business, are thinking of calling the baby Winston if it is a boy. ‘It’s growing on us,’ Mrs Parsons said. ‘But for now we are calling it peace-baby, that’s our nickname.’ Mrs Parsons, who has a daughter, Grace, six, from a previous marriage, said that in the 12-week scan the child had given a clear thumbs-up. Churchill is reported to have once said: ‘All babies look like me. But then, I look like all babies.’ Expectant parents Dee and Ed Parsons said the image was 'very reassuring' because the symbol is so 'happy'

Alexandre and Ronaldo Antunes had a special birthday party at the Tufts Medical Center on Thursday while gathered with the staff who helped their family during their births last March. The oldest by nearly a month, Alexandre, was born prematurely on March 2 followed by the arrival of his twin brother on March 26. Scroll down for video .

Dr Jonathan Davis (center), chief of Newborn Medicine at the hospital, said he had never seen delayed interval delivery this successful . Lindalva Pinheiro da Silva, the boys' mother, went into labor 16 weeks early last February and had a delayed interval delivery, which is rare. She held back tears as she thanked the doctors and staff for their work, according to CBS Boston. 'One year later we are here celebrating,' said Ronaldo Antunes, the boys' father. 'It looks like it was yesterday. It's unbelievable. Grateful to be here celebrating their first year.' Nurse JoAnn Loiselle said: 'To see them [Alexandre and Ronaldo] going from tiny and fighting for their lives to thriving with what looks like no deficits is almost a miracle.

"The NFL has its first full-time female game official. Sarah Thomas, who has worked exhibition games, will be a line judge for the 2015 season, the league announced on Wednesday. The 41-year-old was in the league's officiating development program in 2013-14 and worked some team minicamps last year. She's already broken ground in the officiating field as the first woman to work college games in 2007. She was the first female official on the FBS level and the first to officiate a bowl game, the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl in Detroit. Sarah Thomas is the NFL's first full-time female referee and will be a line judge during the upcoming season . Thomas poses during the pre-season game between the Seahawks and the Chargers last year . 'I am a female, but I don't look at myself as just a female,' Thomas said last June while working a Cleveland Browns minicamp. 'I look at myself as an official.' Shannon Eastin worked regular-season NFL games in 2012 as a replacement official, making her the first female to do so in any capacity. She also was a line judge. Thomas, a former college basketball player, was inspired to become an official in the 1990s when she attended a meeting with her brother, Lea. In 1996, Thomas became the first female to officiate in a Division 1-A high school football game in Mississippi. Just under a decade later, she began officiating college games when she was hired by Conference USA, working as a line judge and head linesman. She also has worked the Senior Bowl, the Fight Hunger Bowl, the Medal of Honor Bowl, and the Conference USA Championship game in 2010 and 2014. Thomas officiated two seasons in the United Football League, which is now out of business. Off the field, she's a pharmaceutical representative. She said last June her two sons and one daughter see nothing extraordinary about her football job. 'They just know mom officiates and it's nothing foreign to them or pioneering or anything,' she said. 'I do this.'

"As if he didn’t already know, Joe Schmidt found out the hard way last Saturday that 80 minutes can be a long time in rugby. Ireland were riding the crest of a wave arriving into Cardiff. Ten successive wins and the Grand Slam there for the taking. Eighty minutes later, their unbeaten run was over and now they face the very real prospect of being left with nothing to show for their efforts in 2015. A year ago they had momentum going into the closing round of the championship. They led the table with a huge points difference and, after England fell short of eclipsing that target in Rome, there were no outside complications weighing on Ireland’s mind in that evening’s tournament closer: beat France and the title was theirs. Jared Payne (left), Iain Henderson (centre) and Jordi Murphy warm-up during Ireland training on Thursday . Ireland flanker Sean O'Brien fires out a backhand pass during Ireland's session at their base in Carton House . Jonathan Sexton (centre) and his fellow Irish players are gearing up for their crunch clash against Scotland . Twelve months later they are in an awkward bind — second on points difference with no exact clarity on what type of win is needed to retain their title given that England will be last into action tomorrow. Adding to Ireland’s anxiety is their inability to get over the try line. Whereas 16 were scored in the title run in 2014 run, there have been just four in 320 minutes this term. Schmidt, though, claims not to be worried about the drought, adding that a level of tolerance must be shown towards the development of his new midfield combination now that Brian O’Driscoll has retired and Gordon D’Arcy has been omitted for the Six Nations. ‘The game is very fickle,’ he claimed after announcing a team to play Scotland showing two changes from Wales with Luke Fitzgerald and Cian Healy getting in ahead of Simon Zebo and Jack McGrath. ‘One week you might score three tries and the next week you might not get any and you might have played better in the second week but you just didn’t convert the opportunities.

He used the Grindr app to send political messages to members of Melbourne’s Prahran electorate, living in the suburbs of Prahran, Windsor, South Yarra and St Kilda East, as the candidate campaigns ahead of the election. The Star Observer reports that Sharpe was using the app on a trial basis for this election. 'It’s not a space I play in regularly,' said Ms Sharpe, who is standing as Labor’s candidate in the inner west seat of Newtown. Ms Sharpe and Mr Greenwich both placed ads on Grindr to encourage people to vote for them . 'But I’m sure that some of my volunteers have profiles. 'For us, it’s a totally new way of talking to people and we know there are lots of people who aren’t as engaged.' Mr Greenwich also said that it was the first time that he had used the app to reach out to the electorate. But if it proved successful he wouldn’t rule out using other apps in the future. Ms Sharpe’s ads were paid for out of her campaign funds while Mr Greenwich’s is courtesy of campaign group Out For. Grindr is a smartphone app to facilitate casual sex for gay men . However, it was Mr Hibbins who was the original trailblazer. ‘This election we're using Grindr to reach voters in Prahran,' Mr Hibbins wrote on his Facebook page before the Victorian state election last November. 'We'll be using it to promote events, our support for equality and broader policies.' Mr Hibbins believed that although he was the first to use the strategy in Australia, the idea would take off as a popular campaign approach. Sam Hibbins used Grindr to send targeted messages to the homosexual community in his electorate in Prahan ahead of last November's state election in Victoria . Dutch and Irish politicians were the first to use Grindr to connect with voters. Dutch politician Jan-Bert Vroege used the app to campaign in March last year. He did not use pop up messages like Mr Hibbins however, rather transforming his own pre-existing Grindr account, changing his profile description to: ‘let’s have a date on March 19’ to promote a political event about gay issues. Last May, Irish politician Phil Prendergast used Grindr as part of her European

"Aitor Karanka hailed his two-goal star striker Patrick Bamford after Middlesbrough romped to a 4-1 victory at home to Ipswich. Bamford scored two outstanding second-half goals to ease the Teessiders to victory at the Riverside Stadium after a nervy opening half-hour. Boro gained an early lead through Daniel Ayala before Sky Bet Championship top scorer Daryl Murphy drew the Tractor Boys level. Patrick Bamford rounds Bartosz Bialkowski before scoring his side's third goal at the Riverside . Bamford reels away in celebration as he celebrates his goal against Ipswich Town in the lunchtime kick off . But Albert Adomah nudged Boro back into the lead before Bamford's brilliant brace. 'Patrick deserves those goals for his work rate and he showed great confidence in the way he took both of them,' said Karanka. 'It was massive to win, we needed a performance today and I thought we were brilliant against a good, strong team. Ipswich Town left-back Tyrone Mears runs with the ball as a tackle comes in from Adam Clayton . 'We've played against a very strong team who finished the game with four strikers and the main thing is that we're eight points ahead of them in seventh. 'To be eight points ahead of them is a good situation for us.' Boro's first two goals came from set plays, and the Spaniard added: 'We've been working on our set-pieces this week and it was brilliant how the first two goals came from them. 'We've put the points on the board in the early kick-off and that was important. 'Some of our performances of late have not been the best but today we did very well. Maybe some people expected us to be bad but we gave the perfect answer.' The scoreline arguably flattered Boro, who have won and lost three out of their last six games but went back to the top of the table before other fixtures on Saturday afternoon. Albert Adomah strikes for goal in the . Ipswich looked bright in the first half and hit the post with the score at 1-1. Town boss Mick McCarthy said: 'We worked on defending corners and conceded two goals from them. 'We were great in the first half and second half we were undone by a really good goal by Patrick Bamford, it's great play by him. 'I'll take responsibility after 3-1. I threw strikers on, we were all over the place and a bit of a shambles at the end. We're organised at corners normally and shouldn't concede. 'It looked a bit shambolic at the end as we pushed forward and I'll take responsibility for that. 'Automatic promotion is looking hard now, we're not going to win three more games than two or three teams between now and the end of the season.'

"(CNN)Early Thursday -- during the ongoing protests that continue to shake Ferguson, Missouri -- two police officers were shot. Such violence and lawlessness should never be tolerated. But the unrest during which it occurred demonstrates that the people of Ferguson have lost all confidence in their police department. And the resignation of the police chief this week won't be enough to restore faith in law and order. Everyone in the department needs to step down so the department can be rebuilt from the ground up. It is easy to see why. After a police officer shot Michael Brown, the U.S. Department of Justice conducted an investigation into the Ferguson Police Department. What investigators found was a ""pattern and practice"" of discrimination against African-Americans. In a town with a black population of 67%, black people represented 85% of vehicle searches, 90% of the traffic violations and 93% of the arrests. There is no way to justify this. Now, the Department of Justice has an opportunity to gut the Ferguson Police Department and rebuild it from scratch. In fact, it's more than an opportunity: It's a necessity. In the court of law, there is an old closing argument that goes like this: You sit down, pour yourself a bowl of stew and find that the first piece of meat that you taste is rancid. You don't put just that piece aside; you throw out the whole bowl. Lawyers use this story to say that if you catch a witness lying about one thing, then you can't believe anything they say. Unfortunately, it is an analogy that can be applied to the Ferguson Police Department. The Department of Justice report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department cannot be ignored, and the problems it reveals cannot be fixed from the inside. If there are a few good cops in the Ferguson Police Department, they need to leave, and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization. In fact, everyone in the Ferguson Police Department needs to leave, from the top to the bottom. The police department should be completely reconstituted under Department of Justice control in a manner that ensures that citizens of Ferguson receive the type of public service they pay for and deserve -- and more importantly, in a manner that protects their rights, not only as citizens of Ferguson, Missouri, but as constitutionally protected citizens of our country. A completely rebuilt Ferguson Police Department, established with a charter to enforce the law with equality, could serve as an example for every law enforcement agency in the country. A new Ferguson Police Department could show what a concerted, roots-up effort toward nonracist behavior in a police department can be. Under Justice Department leadership, the Ferguson Police Department could become a model for practices such as equipping all police with body cameras, community policing and better use of force training. If we can create from the ashes of the Ferguson Police Department a model that works, it may

"Rare: Riad Al Qassas told customs the £2m statue from Libya was from Turkey and worth £100,000 . A judge took a day out of court yesterday to visit the British Museum. But it wasn’t for an Easter holiday jolly around the exhibits. It was to help him rule in the case of an ancient statue which is said to have be smuggled out of war-torn Libya. The trial centres on a businessman who claimed in paper work that the treasure was a statue for home decoration. Experts, however say the Greek marble figure – which is thought to depict Persephone, goddess of the underworld – was looted from a world heritage site. While the man who had it delivered to a warehouse in West London claimed it was about 100 years old and worth around £75,000, they say it is worth £2million and dates from the third to first centuries BC. They claim it was intended for the lucrative private market in classical antiquities. Yesterday District Judge John Zani – accompanied by a gaggle of barristers and solicitors – went to inspect the statue at the British Museum, where it is being safeguarded in a basement till the conclusion of the case. Although the press were barred from the viewing, a video of it was later played in court which showed the judge circling the statue as marks were pointed out to him. He was told stains and other evidence meant it was ‘definitely’ excavated illegally from the ancient Greek colony of Cyrene – once known as the Athens of Africa. It is said to have been smuggled out of Libya via Dubai in 2011 before being discovered by UK customs officials two years later. Libya has been plagued by looting and cultural vandalism since the fall of Colonel Gaddaffi in 2011, with the resulting power vacuum effectively ending the state-sponsored preservation of the country’s multiple Greek and Roman sites. The sculpture is said to have originally served as a grave marker and displays unusual iconography including snake-like bracelets and a doll-type figurine. Jordanian national Riad Al Qassas – who is not in court – is accused of falsifying paperwork after he told customs that the sculpture came from Turkey. Dr Peter Higgs, curator of Greek sculpture at the museum, told the judge the statue was in ‘the top ten’ of its class. Caught in a lie: Experts at the British Museum, pictured, say the statue is worth £2million and dates from the third to first centuries BC . He said: ‘I believe the statue was definitely made in Libya, in Cyrenaica’, adding it was extremely rare. He added that his valuation of £2million had been made on 2011 prices, but said there were no directly comparable examples from auction house records. Andrew Bird, for HMRC, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court that academics had decided ‘on the balance of probabilities, this statue had been unlawfully excavated from a UNESCO world heritage site’. He said documents suggested Al Qassas had only a marginal role in the export, placing the blame with Hassan Fazeli,

"English cricket’s new bosses flexed their muscles when Paul Downton paid the price for a humiliating World Cup by being sacked as managing director. Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body’s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England’s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just ‘too accident prone’. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England’s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. ‘The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,’ said Harrison in an ECB statement. ‘The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.’ Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today’s board meeting at Lord’s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. ‘This doesn’t impact on Peter Moores’ position at all,’ Harrison said later on Sky. ‘This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.’ Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing .

"Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn was able to leave Melbourne with a smile, happy to see the end of what she described as one of the worst weeks of her career. The first five and a half days from last Monday were overshadowed by a legal battle in the Supreme Court of Victoria with former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde and his claim on a full-time race-seat for this season. That was eventually resolved on Saturday morning ahead of qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix, although further talks are planned this week - in a private arena away from the courtroom - between both sides in a bid to finally close the matter. Monisha Kaltenborn was happy to end a tough week with a smile on her face at the Australian Grand Prix . Sauber have been embroiled in a legal battle with their former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde (centre) Once Sauber and Kaltenborn were again able to concentrate on the racing, drivers Marcus Ericsson and rookie Felipe Nasr acquitted themselves well. Nasr was a superb fifth - the highest position by a Brazilian driver on debut - while Ericsson's eighth-place finish was the best result by a Swede since Stefan Johansson in the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix. When you consider Sauber endured the worst season in their history last year when they failed to score a point , their feats around Melbourne's Albert Park were all the more remarkable. 'It was a very nice ending to the weekend,' Kaltenborn said. 'The events of last week were not easy for the entire team. You can try to keep things away from them, but they are exposed to it. You just don't know how to shield it from them. On the track, Felipe Nasr finished fifth - the highest a Brazilian driver has ever finished on his debut . Kaltenborn (left) looks dejected as she attends a press conference of team principals in Melbourne last week . 'But it was impressive how the team continued to do their work, to remain focused and to bring home the kind of result we saw. 'For me personally, last week was probably one of my toughest in my time at Sauber, and I don't want to experience it again. 'I'm very glad it's over - all the more glad with the outcome (of the race) - and we focus now on the future.' Kaltenborn conceded on Friday the events of last week had resulted in 'a negative impact' on the team, but she felt confident that, given the tremendous result, it had now been restored. 'With what happened, the morale was affected, but you could feel they got themselves together,' Kaltenborn added. 'With these kind of results, you can have an extra push of motivation and you can feel good about it. 'This result tells people we're back, to forget about what happened last year, that it was a one-off and won't happen again.'

The NFL's Offensive Player of the Year is set to sign a five-year deal worth more than $40million, with more than $20m guaranteed, according to NFL.com's Albert Breer. Murray became the NFL's leading rusher thanks to a career-high number of carries (392) and working behind one of the best offensive lines in football. DeMarco Murray is set to join the Philadelphia Eagles after four seasons with the Cowboys . In a career-high year, Murray carried the Cowboys into the playoffs for the first time in five years . With rumours that veteran Evan Mathis is to be traded, the Eagles do have the youth or consistency in that position group. The 27-year-old had a career-high season with 1,845 yards and 13 touchdowns, but Dallas let him enter the free agent market.

After joining from St Louis in the remarkable trade with Nick Foles, Bradford confirmed he played a part too. 'Absolutely. I've been trying my hardest,' Bradford said. 'I've called him. I've texted him. I've done everything. We've been in communication. If we can somehow land him, it would be a great pickup. Not only is he a great player, he's a great person. He's a really close friend of mine, too. I think he can really help this ball club.' The Eagles, who have had an eventful free agency, also announced the signing of fellow running back Ryan Mathews. The former San Diego Charger joins on a three-year, $11.5m contract, with a guaranteed $5m. With Darren Sproles already in situ, it gives Kelly a loaded backfield and the ability to use multiple backs.

Restored: Britain's last-ever mobile cinema has been brought back to its former glory after film buffs found it rotting in a field in 2005 . But now the pair have decided the time has come to sell the bus, which has taken over their lives for more than a decade. 'We've got two children under three,' Emma said. 'Sometimes my mother-in-law comes along and looks after the kids on whatever event site we're on but it's getting to be too hard with the two of them getting bigger.' After years on the road, the couple had their first baby Iona May Giffard Halls in 2012 and five months ago, they're second arrived, Ivy. Since then, Ollie has had to spend five months a year on tour while Emma stays at home with the children and he's now looking forward to having more time with Iona and Ivy. Love affair: Emma and Ollie outside the Bedford cinema which has taken over their lives since they restored it ten years ago . Iona May Giffar Halls, two and a half years old, sits outside the mobile cinema. Her parents are looking to offload the classic so they can concentrate on being parents to her and sister Ivy, five months old. Dad Ollie doesn't want to be on tour as they grow up . Happy families: Mum Emma with Iona May, left, and Ivy, right. The family have just bough they're first home in Somerset . 'I'll miss being on the road and that diversity but if I didn't give it up, I'd miss my children growing up and spending social time with them which is more important than the bus.' It's now listed on eBay for £120,000 which is 100 times what they originally bought it for, but it's not just a bus, it's a piece of British history, listed as 'the soul survivor' of the original fleet. It's one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967, to promote British industry as a global leader by visiting factories to show films about modernisation. With a plastic perspex bubble at the front and a Tardis-like interior with a 26-seater cinema inside, the Bedford SB3 looked like something from the future as they toured the country promoting the 'white heat of technology'. The vintage mobile cinema is one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967 . A piece of history: This was how the buses were advertised

"Trekking through the dunes of the Sahara in 40 degree heat can be thirsty work even for camels. And one for one of the animals taking a long swig from a beer bottle was just what they needed to refresh themselves. The herd of camels were on a trek across the Erg Chebbi dunes in Morocco, where one of the group was snapped having a refreshing drink. A camel takes a swig from a beer bottle on a short refreshment stop while trekking across the Sahara desert . Tour guides filled the beer bottles with water for the camels to drink as temperatures reached as high as 40 degrees . But rather than swigging down beer the bottles had actually been filled with water by the guides for the camels to drink. Photographer Joao Victor Bolan, who captured the image, said: 'The picture where a camel drinks from a bottle, it was obviously just for fun. It was just water. 'They don't usually drink too often and while we were there, I hadn't seen any camel drinking. 'We only made a short stop - I would say not more than 15 minutes - but judging by how fast they drank it, I guess they were thirsty.' Mr Bolan travelled over 370 miles across the High Atlas mountain range from the Moroccan city of Marrakech to reach the sand dunes. The pictures were snapped by photographer Joao Bolan, who spent time trekking across the Erg Chebbi dunes in Morocco . The 26-year-old travelled with a guide and a friend and when they reached the dunes, they hired a total of six camels to help them explore the area. And while there, they experienced extreme temperatures ranging from soaring heat during the day to freezing temperatures around minus five late at night. Mr Bolan, from Sao Paulo, Brazil added: 'I was photographing the route from Marrakech to Erg Chebbi through the High Atlas region. The group experienced extreme temperatures on their trek ranging from soaring hear during the day to freezing temperatures at night . 'We stopped at a base camp for the dunes where we spent the night. 'Like any other desert, it was incredibly hot during the day and cold at night. 'Riding the camels was a little uncomfortable to be honest. 'After two hours, your back really starts to hurt but I would say that was a nice experience because it's a huge animal that goes on a paced rhythm in a majestic environment.'

"Two third grade pupils have been suspended after cracking the school's computer network to find sexually explicit images and sharing them with classmates. A nine-year-old girl, who attends Sunnycrest Elementary School in Lake Stevens, Washington, was using a school computer during class, when she was able to access the porn. She then circulated the images among her classmates before teachers became aware of the situation. The students have been suspended from Sunnycrest Elementary School, pictured, after finding sexually explicit images on a school computer . The incident only emerged when an email was sent to parents promising that a full investigation into the incident would take place. The girl and another student have now been suspended from the school, with Lake Stevens School District promising a probe into how the student was able to find the pictures despite filters being in place. But some parents have reacted angrily after learning their children had seen the explicit images. Austin Maxwell, whose eight-year-old stepdaughter attends the school, told K5 that she was upset after seeing the pictures and that he was shocked a child was able to find such content on a school computers. He said: 'We never in he world would have thought she was accessing what she was accessing on the school's equipment.' The third grade student was said to find the explicit images after circumnavigating the school's computer network which filters adult content . The email sent to parents by district officials said that all student computer use at the school is being suspended until a full investigation takes place. It read: 'Once staff members became aware of the situation, Information Technology technicians were immediately notified and all student computer use at Sunnycrest is suspended until our investigation is complete. 'To ensure that all images have been removed, our technicians have deleted content from all Sunnycrest third-grade students' computer accounts. 'In addition, all students will be once again reminded about digital citizenship and the importance of notifying an adult right away when encountering inappropriate content. '

"A probe into how police handled child sexual exploitation in Rotherham is looking into allegations against 42 officers after complaints were sent to the force watchdog. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was already examining allegations against ten officers involved in the investigation into one of the country's most prolific child abuse rings. But today the commission said it had received 30 new complaints containing 100 allegations about 42 officers involved in the Rotherham investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is examining 100 allegations made against 42 officers from South Yorkshire Police who investigated child sex abuse in Rotherham (file image) The complaints came in the wake of the Jay Report, which described how 1,400 children, mainly girls, were routinely raped, trafficked and groomed in South Yorkshire between 1997 and 2013 . It said in a statement: 'The complaints contain more than 100 allegations against 42 named police officers, both retired and serving, as well as a number of allegations against officers whose identities are currently unknown.' The complaints followed on from the Jay Report, which described how at least 1,400 children were raped, trafficked and groomed in the South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013. The IPCC statement said: 'Work to establish the identity of the unknown officers and to identify any links between the different complaints and incidents is ongoing. 'The allegations range from neglect of duty by failing to adequately investigate on the basis of intelligence or to deal with incidents appropriately, inappropriate comments and suggestions of corrupt relationships between police officers and offenders.' The commission said it was also investigating an allegation that South Yorkshire Police failed to act on information passed to them in 2004 and 2006 about alleged child abuse in nearby Sheffield. This complaint relates to two named police officers who are now retired from the police service, the IPCC said. The Jay Report, published in August last year, sparked furious debate about the tragic crimes which took place in Rotherham, and how the perpetrators went unchallenged for so long. The Jay report found that the abuse went unchallenged as police and council chiefs were afraid of being labelled racist, as the perpetrators were largely gangs of Asian men . Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote the report, described how hundreds of vulnerable teenagers, mainly girls, were routinely exploited by gangs of mainly Asian men with impunity. Police and senior council officers were accused of failing to tackle the problem for fear of being seen as racist, and of ignoring or doubting the victim's accounts. A wave of high profile resignations followed and the National Crime Agency was brought in to investigate the crimes and how they were handled. The Jay Report was followed by another report by Louise Casey, which was scathing in its criticism of Rotherham Council and led to the replacement of the local authority's ruling cabinet with commissioners appointed by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. After more revelations about the scale of exploitation in neighbouring Sheffield, the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Alan Billings, last month called for a wide-ranging inspection of

"If you struggle to get your child to go to school in the morning, don’t blame them - it could be your fault. Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University. More than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research (stock image shown) Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia and the US. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non-shared-environment factors had the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact. Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact (stock image shown) A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures,’ said Professor Stephen Petrill, of Ohio State University. ‘It was surprising. The knee-jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student, or the child himself is responsible. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. ‘That doesn’t mean we don’t try to encourage and inspire students, but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different.’ The results don’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning, he added, but they suggest a complex process, involving many genes and gene-environment interactions that help influence a child’s motivation to learn. The study will be published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.

"Jailed: Dennis Scott, pictured outside Hull Crown Court on Friday, falsely claimed more than £23,000 . A 65-year-old man who claimed almost £24,000 in benefits despite having £88,000 in the bank has been jailed. Dennis Scott received thousands in pension credits between 2009 and 2014 by falsely claiming that he had less than £4,000 in capital. But a recent house sale meant the grandfather had significantly more money - making him ineligible for the credits, which are intended to guarantee pensioners a minimum income. He claimed the money had been destined for his grandchildren, saying he had wanted to give them a 'better start in life'. Scott, from Barnsholme, East Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to dishonestly making a false statement to the Department of Work and Pensions. He was jailed for eight months at Hull Crown Court on Friday. The court heard the £23,776.16 he falsely claimed had been repaid in full by July last year. Defending, Antony Farrell told the court that Scott was a family man who had wanted to give his grandchildren a better start in life than the one he had been given. Jailing him, Judge Richardson QC said Scott had behaved in a 'shameful fashion'. He said: 'It must be made very clear to you and to anyone like you who is tempted to defraud the state in respect of social security benefits that a prison sentence is likely to follow such conduct. 'Your flagrantly breached that system by your shameful conduct. For a man of your years you ought to know better.' He also noted that Scott had not pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.

"Theresa May initially rejected an application for the 32-year-old Taliban henchman to stay in the UK, but her decision was overturned by immigration judges . A Taliban henchman suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds. The 32-year-old, known only by the initials SAKA, admitted that his father was in charge of 65 Taliban troops, but claimed he only agreed to join the terrorist group because he was worried about his safety. He also claimed he had been tortured during four years in jail in Kandahar after being accused of killing a provincial governor’s son. The bodyguard escaped from prison and went into hiding, but claimed that he fled to Britain after Taliban fighters tried to track him down. The Afghan, whose identity has been kept secret by the courts, had an initial claim for sanctuary rejected by Home Secretary Theresa May. But in a controversial move, immigration judges have now thrown out her decision and given SAKA permission to stay because he was entitled to asylum and protection under human rights laws. It was ruled that deporting him to Afghanistan would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Experts said he would be ‘at risk of mistreatment and physical harm if he were arrested on account of being a suspected Taliban’. Court papers said: ‘During his time with the Taliban he saw a leader behead a man because he believed him to be a spy. After this incident his father decided to leave the Taliban. ‘Whilst crossing the desert the appellant and his father were arrested and placed in detention. The appellant was accused of killing MK, the son of the governor of Herat. ‘The appellant claims he then spent four years in Sarpoza prison in Kandahar and was never formally convicted or tried. ‘He claimed he was tortured and his head was covered and he was beaten.’ SAKA claimed he escaped from the prison and travelled with a Taliban member to his home in Kunduz. He said his father had been shot dead trying to flee the jail. At some point he arrived in the UK. The Home Office considered whether he had actually been convicted of murder and whether his presence in Britain ‘constituted a danger to the community’. Hearing the case in the Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, Judge Helen Rimington ruled that if SAKA were sent home the Taliban 'might also be informed of his return’ Lawyers for the department accepted he was a ‘low level member of the Taliban’.

"Jerusalem (CNN)Within 48 hours of his election night victory, Benjamin Netanyahu rolled back his pre-election comments that there would be no Palestinian state if he were Prime Minister, but the damage may already have been done to relations with the two other major players in the negotiations: the United States and the Palestinians. In an interview with NBC, Netanyahu said, ""I haven't changed my policy, I never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. What has changed is the reality, Abu Mazen (nickhame of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas) the Palestinian leader refuses to recognize the Jewish state, and he's made a pact with Hamas that calls for the destruction of Israel. And every territory vacated these days in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces and we want that to change so we can realize the vision of real sustained peace. I don't want a one-state solution, I want a sustainable two-state solution."" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat says he believes the pre-election statement that Netanyahu will not allow a two-state solution. He says the Palestinians will keep pursuing statehood through the international arena instead of through negotiations. ""I've negotiated with them for 20 years, and I complained to the international community that there is a big difference between someone being a tough negotiator which is legitimate and someone being a non-negotiator,"" Erekat said. ""All Netanyahu needs to do to gain the credibility and the trust, not only of me but of the international community, he needs to stand tall and tell the Israeli people that in order to live in peace with our neighbors we're going to have to recognize the state of Palestine."" Erekat says the Palestinians may try again for recognition once more at the United Nations, a forum where they fell one vote short of recognition as a full UN member state in December. A new United Nations Security Council consisting of different member states may be more favorable to a second Palestinian bid. So where does that leave the United States? The White House said it would ""reassess"" the relationship between the United States and Israel. The broad relationship includes security cooperation, financial assistance, and strong diplomatic ties. Both leaders reaffirmed the strength of those ties in the weeks before the Israeli elections. But the United States has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to block resolutions unfavorable to Israel. Some of that protection could be at stake here as the White House urges both sides back to negotiations. The last peace talks, moderated by Secretary of State John Kerry, broke down in April 2014 after nine months of negotiations. As the talks deteriorated before the scheduled deadline, Israel withdrew from the negotiations when Fatah announced a reconciliation with Hamas, a militant Islamic group, and an intention to form a unity government. In a phone call with Netanyahu, President Barack Obama congratulated Netanyahu and stressed the importance of a two-state solution. But with so much skepticism

"(CNN)The American Pharmacists Association is discouraging its members from participating in executions. On Monday, the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy, stating that ""such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers."" This bolsters the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term ""drug"" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases. The group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection, said Michelle Spinnler, spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. That spotlight includes a January Supreme Court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in Oklahoma. This was prompted by Clayton Lockett's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack. In Georgia last month, the execution of female death row inmate Kelly Renee Gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy. Thirty-two sates allow capital punishment, and lethal injection is still the most common method. Last month, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available. Of the eight inmates currently on death row in Utah, three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad. Pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection. In Texas, the department of criminal justice told CNN in March they are running out of their supply. In July 2011, Lundbeck Inc., the manufacturer of pentobarbital, decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment. The companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose, so states then turned to compounded preparations, Spinnler said. ""Pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way."" she says. The new declaration by the American Pharmacists Association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology.

"Britons heading to Europe on holiday are facing the nightmare of arriving at their destination and not being able to hire a car, thanks to a controversial driving licence shake-up. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences. Information about penalty points for traffic violations such as speeding will be held only on the DVLA’s database, and will have to be checked online, by phone or by post. But motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist’s details. Scroll down for video . Changes: Britons heading to Europe on holiday are facing the nightmare of arriving at their destination and not being able to hire a car, thanks to a controversial driving licence (file picture) shake-up . Concerns: Motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist’s details . From June 8, holidaymakers heading abroad will have to log on to the DVLA website the day before and put in their driving licence number to obtain a special code to give to their car hire company when they arrive at the desk. But fears are growing that the ‘muddled’ introduction of the new rules will mean people could be turned away because many car hire firms abroad will still insist on examining the paper document to check for endorsements or bans. Furthermore, the passcode is valid for only 72 hours, meaning anyone hiring a car in the second week of their trip faces having to find an internet cafe or pay expensive roaming charges. Mark Bower, of the car hire insurance website MoneyMaxim, said holidaymakers could endure major problems at car hire desks across Europe. He added: ‘Most people are simply unaware that these changes are on the way – and it is not just renters. ‘I spoke to one big car hire firm in Portugal this week and they knew nothing of the changes. Six weeks away from implementation, the whole thing is very muddled. ‘It is another thing you have to remember to do just before departure. Or you can do it at the desk with your smartphone if you can remember the website address, don’t mind the data roaming charges, can remember your national insurance number and are impervious to the long queue developing behind you.’ The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences (file picture) Mr Bower also said unscrupulous firms might use the issue as ‘another excuse’ to persuade people to pay for extra insurance. Motorists will also be able to download their driving history as a printable PDF file, although it is unclear whether all car hire firms will accept that, or how drivers without access to a computer will cope. The DVLA insists the changes have been widely publicised. But consumers booking car hire for holidays after June have not

"Manchester United and Liverpool target £25million Memphis Depay has held talks with Paris St Germain this week with the permission of his club PSV Eindhoven. The dialogue between PSG and Depay represents a threat to the Premier League clubs with the Qatari-backed French club understood to have made a significantly better financial offer than Liverpool. United have yet to hold detailed talks with the player but have informed PSV of their wish to do so while Liverpool have established a good relationship with the club and would be serious contenders to sign the wide player if United's offer does not match their own. Memphis Depay (centre) has held talks with PSG, despite Liverpool and Manchester United's interest . Holland player Depay (right) has caught the eye of clubs over Europe with good form for club and country . Louis van Gaal gave Depay his international debut but could miss out on bringing him to Old Trafford . However, Depay is intrigued by the prospect of playing with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and is good friends with Gregory van der Wiel, his team-mate in the Holland national team, who is also at PSG. With Bayern Munich also considering a move for the winger, a move to the Premier League is in the balance though if United firm up their interest, they clearly have an advantage. Louis van Gaal gave Depay his international debut for Holland and the player also worked under van Gaal's assistant, Albert Stuivenberg in the Holland Under-17 team which won the 2011 European Championships.

"Aaron Ramsey has scored 25 goals for Arsenal since the start of last season, none more vital than a dramatic extra-time winner in the FA Cup final. But his last one — the only goal of the game at Burnley — meant the world, because it was for someone special. ‘I’ve had a tough few weeks,’ said Ramsey, who pointed skywards after scoring at Turf Moor. ‘I’ve been on an emotional rollercoaster of late. My gran passed away a few weeks ago and she meant an awful lot to me. We had a great relationship and I’ve dedicated my last couple of goals to her. Aaron Ramsey celebrates his goal against Burnley by dedicating it to his late Gran who passed away . ‘Her name is Eileen. She’s on my Mum’s side and we used to call her Nanny Leany. She was 84. She was an incredible woman. ‘She lost her husband early in her life and raised seven kids on her own and in those days it was an incredibly difficult thing to do. She was always happy, making jokes and I had that sort of outlook on life. She always believed in me and gave me reassurances.

She didn’t go to my games but I got her Sky to watch a few. She would always complain it was not on normal TV.’ Ramsey will be on ‘normal TV’ when the BBC screen today’s semi-final from Wembley, as he was last May when his 16th goal of a prolific season won the FA Cup and ended Arsenal’s nine-year wait for a trophy. ‘It was a great day and a great moment in my career,’ he said. ‘It was a relief as well.’ Ramsey points to the sky has the goalscorer is greeted by Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin at Turf Moor .

"(CNN)A court in Ivory Coast has sentenced former first lady Simone Gbagbo to 20 years in prison, the official AIP news agency said. Gbagbo was convicted Monday for her role in carrying out crimes against humanity following post-election violence in 2010 which left more than 3,000 people dead. Her husband, former president Laurent Gbagbo, is in the custody of the Hague-based International Criminal Court awaiting trial over similar charges. The charges stem from the aftermath of Gbagbo's husband's election defeat in 2010. Laurent Gbagbo, then the incumbent president, refused to step down after Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the election. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of the two sides, leaving thousands dead. In 2012, the ICC issued a warrant against her, alleging that as a member of the president's inner circle, his wife was an ""indirect co-perpetrator."" She attended meetings where plans were discussed and carried out to persecute Ouattara supporters, according to the warrant. Her husband surrendered to the ICC in December of that year, and is currently awaiting trial at The Hague on crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths. Both have denied the charges. But Ivory Coast refused to transfer Simone Gbago, saying it would try her in a domestic court instead. On Monday, it did. CNN's Faith Karimi contributed to this report.

Karen Danczuk walks into Manchester Airport this morning as she heads off on a break with a friend . Mrs Danczuk flew away for a break three weeks after she first made the allegations public, before making a complaint to the police. A source said: 'Everything had become a bit much for her and she's decided to go away for a few days and just get out of the country.' Last month, Mrs Danczuk – who became well-known for posting revealing 'selfie' pictures of herself on Twitter – claimed she was raped by a family member ‘hundreds of times’ between the ages of six and 12.

I’m just so shocked and disgusted by it all.’ Mrs Danczuk, 31, has said she starting posting ‘selfies’ after feeling she can now ‘have fun without being ashamed of myself’.

"At nine months old, babies, if they are really advanced, might be crawling around on the floor, or shuffling from A to B. However, this tiny tot has been filmed surfing - as his father takes him out on his bodyboard. Jorge Tirado, 43, captured footage of his son riding the waves for the first time on a GoPro camera, and uploaded online. Like a pro: The footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board . The footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves, and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave. Although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water, it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves. Tirado does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in Puerto Rico. Not impressed... Jorge's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave . The baby is visible at the height of a huge wave, bracing himself for impact, with his father propped up over him . The baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave, but handles the impact well . Although there was some criticism over the stunt from online viewers, the dad defended the decision to take his son who he did not name into the water saying: 'My son first try. Thanks to everyone. 'I encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean, after all the ocean is the place where it all began. 'By far, this is the best sport for your spiritual, mental and physical health.' In the video, Jorge can be seen holding his son, who is unnamed, and getting him ready for a day's surfing. As the two ride ride through the middle of the tube of a wave, the baby is all smiles at the motion . Just chilling: Jorge Tirado, 43, floats with his son in preparation before entering the waves . Beginner's nerves: At first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water, but he soon learns to love the movement through the water . The baby is then seen in the water, with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board. At times, the tot doesn't look impressed, as the water cascades over him. But he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer. While taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous, it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age. Pro-surfer John John Florence, 22, for example, has said that he was only six-months-old when his mother put him in a life vest and sat him on the nose of her surfboard as she paddled into waves.

After a public backlash against McIntyre's comments, SBS Managing Director Michael Ebeid and Director of Sport, Ken Shipp said in a joint statement that his 'highly inappropriate and disrespectful' comments have 'caused his on-air position at SBS to become untenable.' 'Mr McIntyre’s actions have breached the SBS Code of Conduct and social media policy and as a result, SBS has taken decisive action to terminate Mr McIntyre’s position at SBS, with immediate effect.' McIntyre's comments sparked outrage late on Anzac day, with Communications Minister Malcolm Turnball calling them 'despicable remarks' and social media users taking to twitter to spread the #sackScottMcIntre hashtag. In his tweets, the SBS football journalist condemned Anzac day as an 'imperialist invasion.' McIntyre referred to the Anzac's landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey .

"Prosecutor Nafir Afzal said hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber . Hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber, putting children in danger of being radicalised, the country's most senior Muslim prosecutor has said. Nafir Afzal said teenagers are at risk of 'jihadimania' and warned that 'another 7/7' could happen unless Britain makes sweeping changes to the way it tackles terrorism. Mr Afzal, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the north-west, said children are 'manipulated' by Islamists and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation. He told the Guardian's Nigel Bunyan: 'The boys want to be like them and the girls want to be with them. That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image. 'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers – they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.' Mr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services. The prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack. He believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures. 'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension – a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said. Mr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation . The prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right) 'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.' Hundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain. His comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group. Waheed Ahmed, 21 – the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed – is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS.

'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' Borland told ESPN's Outside the Lines. 'From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.' He continued: 'I just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.' Scroll down for video . San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland is retiring from the NFL over health concerns related to repeated head trauma . Borland, who played college football at University of Wisconsin, played just one year in the NFL with the 49ers . The 49ers did not specify in its statement why Borland chose to leave after just one season. 'From speaking with Chris, it was evident that he had put a great deal of thought into this decision. He was a consummate professional from day one,' 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. 'While unexpected, we certainly respect Chris' decision.' Borland, a linebacker, was a star in his only season with the team, registering 108 tackles, a quarterback sack and two interceptions, and earned several rookie of the week and rookie of the month honors. An ankle injury in December ended his season. He has had two prior concussions and said he notified the 49ers of his decision on Friday, which the team confirmed. Borland, who had two concussions prior to retirement, made his announcement on Friday. 'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' he told ESPN's Outside the Lines program .

'There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that X will happen.' He becomes the most prominent NFL player to turn his back on a rich contract, a four-year deal worth just under $3million in Borland's case, over concerns about brain injuries. The announcement comes as an unexpected blow to the 49ers, who have already had a difficult off-season and also saw standout linebacker Patrick Willis retire last week. Many sports reporters and commentators went to Twitter to express their thoughts about Borland's retirement.

The teenagers were reportedly heard shouting to ambulance crews on the side, asking how long someone could survive under water as they scrambled around trying to save their friend. It is thought Mr Greenfield may have had a cardiac arrest because of the shock of jumping into the cold water. His body was eventually discovered five foot below the surface and 20ft from the water's edge just before 11pm on Wednesday - nearly six hours after he was reported in trouble at 5.30pm. James Eisen, a 43-year-old freelance journalist, said: 'I was walking past and I could see a lot of commotion going on over the far side of the pond. 'The guy's friends were going in and out of the water and holding their breath and diving under frantically. 'There were police officers and paramedics and firefighters on the bank just standing there watching while the boys dived under. There was at least seven police officers on the side. 'It was a chaotic and surreal scene. 'I heard one of the boys shouting to one of the ambulance crews and asking how long someone could survive under water without breathing as they continued swimming around in a panic. 'I'm guessing the emergency services are told not to go into the water but if that's the case they probably shouldn't have let the boys carry on swimming about. 'Before I left the police helicopter was flying over and they had launched some boats onto the pond.' Mr Grunfeld's family have paid tribute to the teenager, who they described as a 'wonderful' and 'friendly' man, but said there was no blame because they believed that was the way God was meant to 'take him.' Mr Greenfeld, who is from the Orthodox Jewish community and is thought to have lost his Rabbi father to cancer five years ago, had recently flown home to London from New York, where he was studying religion at a Jewish college. Tragically, he only returned the UK to be with his family during the Passover holiday. His sister, who asked not be named, said: 'He was a wonderful young man and lovely brother who was very well liked, friendly, and he will be dearly missed by his family and friends. 'He was very into studies but he was very fun to be with and he would always try to lend a hand.” Police, specialist divers and 30 firefighters scoured the water for the missing teenager and

"Los Angeles (CNN)Even as major airports across the country clamp down on employee screening, a lone wolf could still potentially slip through security, a top airport official said. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. Patrick Gannon, police chief of Los Angeles International Airport, said the 54,000 employees with security badges undergo recurring criminal background checks and random screening. But even that may not be enough. ""I agree that in any airport throughout the United States and here also, there is never a 100% guarantee that somebody who wanted to do something illegal or wrong couldn't make that happen,"" Gannon said. Only two major airports in the United States -- Miami and Orlando -- conduct full employee screening by requiring all employees with access to secure areas to pass through a metal detector, a CNN investigation found. Other airports like Los Angeles conduct random screenings. Many airports don't do any screenings at all other than a criminal background check before employees are hired. The crackdown on employee screening comes after the arrest of a Delta baggage handler and passenger accused of gun smuggling at Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in December. Both Atlanta and Los Angeles have since begun restricting access by closing access doors that lead to the airfield. Nevertheless, Gannon acknowledged that the potential of a lone wolf committing a crime at the airport worries him. ""It concerns me all the time,"" he said. With so many employees, ""[T]here is no way that you are going to have the ability to screen every single person that comes to work in the airport."" At LAX, employees punch in a code and swipe their badge to access the airfield. Gannon said about 18 out of approximately 300 access doors have been closed as the airport evaluates employee screening procedures. He said, ""the more you limit the access doors, the more you can focus things like spot checks and screenings and cameras."" Even at Miami International Airport, Gannon said, ""they still can't 100% say that they can keep contraband or any type of item out of their restricted area."" Lauren Stover, Miami airport security director, agreed that ID badges alone ""are not enough [to] stop malicious intent."" ""You can vet employees for basic information on their backgrounds, but it's not going to prevent them from carrying out some kind of malicious activity against an airport. And airports need to know their threats. For us, we have threats from criminal activity to being targets of a terrorism attack,"" Stover said. In the wake of congressional scrutiny of airport employee screening procedures, private security guards at Atlanta's airport last month began checking employee bags as the first step toward moving toward full employee screening. The airport also plans to reduce the number of secure access doors from 70 to 10. ""In the last six months ... people are being recruited to engage in terrorist acts,"" said Miguel Southwell, the airport's general manager. ""People are being recruited from the United States. So now we have a greater insider threat."" The TSA is conducting a review

"The cost of a daily lunchtime takeaway can be crippling and yet instead of making lunches at home the majority of British workers still pop to the high street to grab their midday meal. The 'meal deal' (which is not always a meal, or a deal) has seen us stave off the hunger pangs with soggy sandwiches, slimy salads and salty soups, spending an average of £1,840 a year. But we could save up to £1,300 a year if we just prepared our lunch at home. Cheese, crackers and charcuterie is a simple and delicious lunch which can be easily assembled in the office . Food website Food52's 'Not Sad Desk Lunch' series demonstrates just how simple it can be to bring healthy, cost-effective, and delicious lunches to work. These incredibly detailed ideas and recipes show how to make everything from easy-to-assemble options such cheese and crackers, to more complicated steamed Chinese buns, and Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches . Each recipe on Food52 is contributed by a member of the team who promises to keep your midday meals 'both interesting and pretty.' If you're after something simple, cheese, crackers and charcuterie will do the job. Simply choose your favourites, assemble and eat; and If you're vegetarian, swap meat for pickled vegetables and you're good to go. Make something complicated like stuffed dumplings (left) or keep it simple with a toast tartine (right) Hannah Petertil has some inspired combinations which include Cheddar, apple, and bacon jam; mozzarella and prosciuotto or manchego and dried apricots. Keeping with the theme, you could also use the handy cracker to spread a variety of toppings. Make a Greek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta; a hummus cracker with roasted red pepper on top; pesto crackers with thinly sliced prosciutto; or smashed avocado crackers. Don't feel like spreading? Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go. Workers could save up to £1,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed. More than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of £1,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals. In comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just £552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping £1,288. The startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home. Pita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables. Experiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes. Remember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita. Still sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine. Spread with butter or mayonnaise and top with
