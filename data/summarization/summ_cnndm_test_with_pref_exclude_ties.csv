"More than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation . Royal Mail has stepped up the amount of junk mail it stuffs through our doors since it was sold off by the Government, new figures show. More than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation – sparking fears that it risks becoming a ‘leaflet distributor’. In the 12 months after privatisation, postmen pushed almost 50,000 more leaflets and advertising letters through our doors every single day, compared to the previous year. It means almost 3.2bn items of ‘unaddressed’ junk mail were delivered in just one year – almost double the 1.7bn delivered annually five years ago. These figures do not even include the vast quantities of ‘addressed’ junk mail also delivered, which have the names of occupants on the envelope. The rise in unsolicited mail has proved lucrative for Royal Mail, which is struggling from increased competition in the parcels market and a fall in the number of ordinary letters being posted. Revenue from ‘marketing mail’ – addressed and unaddressed – has soared to £1.1bn a year, earning them £3million a day. Critics last night called for Royal Mail to reduce the amount of ‘nuisance’ junk mail it delivers or risk becoming a ‘leaflet distributor’. Royal Mail admitted junk Mail had become an ‘important component’ of its business, and insisted many households found advertising flyers ‘useful’. But much of unwanted junk mail is never opened and ends up being thrown straight into the bin – causing an environmental headache. While some households recycle takeaway menus and pamphlets, many tonnes of junk mail end up in landfill – costing councils tens of millions of pounds to dispose of. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘Junk mail is a blight on the nation’s doormats. ‘Not only is it a nuisance to pick up and throw away, it adds thousands of tonnes to the waste councils have to pick up creating additional costs for tax payers. ‘Royal Mail and its direct marketing clients have to do far more to reduce the torrent of junk mail.’ Robert Rijkhoff, of the Stop Junk Mail campaign, said marketing mail was ‘the worst form of advertising’ because it was foisted upon households without their consent. He said: ‘Royal Mail needs to make money but, if they deliver more and more junk mail as a source of income, in the long term I am not sure it is a sustainable business. ‘Royal Mail is delivering less and less letters. They are risking that, in time, they will become a leaflet distributor.’ Critics claim that some junk mail contain scams sent by fraudsters from overseas. Critics said the company was running the risk of being labelled a 'leaflet distributor' with fewer letters being posted every year . In 2011, the National Fraud Authority claimed the Royal Mail logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy, making the scammers appear more trustworthy. At the time, Mike Haley, director of the National Fraud Authority, Royal Mail

"He has been embroiled in a well-documented feud with Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana after the former called babies born through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) 'synthetic'. But Sir Elton John - whose two sons Zachary, four, and Elijah, two, were conceived with the help of a surrogate and artificial insemination - appeared to offer an olive branch when he declared his love for the fashion duo in Las Vegas on Wednesday night. Speaking on stage at his concert at the Colosseum, Elton included the pair in a list of inspirational people who have changed the world, such as Nelson Mandela and Lady Diana, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . 'I love Dolce & Gabbana!' Elton John (pictured on March 11) spoke from the stage on Wednesday night where he declared his love for D&G despite a recent feud . Famous fans! Elton's show was watched by newly single Bradley Cooper, Miles Tellar, Jonah Hill and British comedian Jimmy Carr on Wednesday . While his praise for the designers was greeted with laughter by the audience, Elton went on to add: 'Listen, the band have been wearing Dolce & Gabbana, I love Dolce & Gabbana clothes.' Sir Elton announced last week that he would boycott the brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised IVF, saying: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that. That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies.' Elton, who is married to David Furnish, responded furiously, writing on Sunday: 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as ""synthetic"". Controversy: Designer Domenico Dolce (right) has defended his controversial remarks and said he 'respects all the world'. He is pictured with business partner Stefano Gabbana (left) 'And shame on you for wagging your judgmental little fingers at IVF – a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children. 'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.' His outburst prompted a mass social media campaign, as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand. Boycott: Sir Elton John (pictured with his husband David Furnish and their children), spoke out against Dolce and Gabbana and claimed that he will never wear any of their clothes ever again after their comments . Equality campaigners and celebrities also weighed in on the dispute - gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has organised a protest outside D&G's London store on Thurday to show the public's opposition to the inflammatory comments.

"It was all's well that ends well for this young elephant after it fell into a mud pit in Kenya. After wallowing in the dank ditch for up to 12 hours, these images and video capture the dramatic moment a digger saved the large mammal from a trunkful of trouble in a heroic rescue mission. The heart-rending rescue took place near Makindu in southern Kenya, where local farmers were shocked to find the distressed male elephant desperately trying to escape from a deep mud pit. Scroll down for video . The digger gets to work to save the stricken elephant after he got stuck in the well in Chyulu Hills National Park, southern Kenya . The young mammal was stuck wallowing in the dank ditch for up to 12 hours before he was able to make its way out of the muddy water . This is the moment the elephant made its break for safety, after the digger was able to create a gentle slope out of the heavy clay . Unable to help the large mammal climb the steep clay sides, wildlife conservationists enlisted the aid of a heroic construction company, who used their digger to plough the elephant to safety. Conservation scientist and wildlife photographer Jeremy Goss, 30, was on the scene to capture these dramatic photos and video footage of the courageous rescue on farmland bordering Chyulu Hills National Park. He said: 'It was heartbreaking to see the elephant in the well, particularly because the community had not been very keen or able to help it out. 'Elephants raid their crops and are generally not welcome, but it was a shocking sight for them nonetheless.' It is believed the young African elephant, which can weigh up to seven tonnes, the same weight as a London double decker bus, had been trapped in the murky sludge for up to 12 hours after it fell in the well while taking a drink.

"Sacked: But Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the incident which got him sacked from Top Gear . Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the attack on a Top Gear producer which led to him being sacked from the hit BBC show. Police had opened an investigation into the incident, which took place at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire last month after Clarkson had been filming Top Gear in the area. However, after the victim Oisin Tymon said that he did not want to press charges, officers have now decided to drop the probe without taking action against Clarkson. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘North Yorkshire Police has now completed its routine enquiries following the incident at Hawes involving Mr Jeremy Clarkson, and we will not be pursuing this matter any further. ‘North Yorkshire Police takes a thorough and victim-led approach to all investigations. ‘Last week, the person at the centre of the incident, Mr Tymon, said that he did not wish the police to take action on his behalf. ‘However, at that point we still needed to speak to some members of the public who were present at the time of the incident, who had been affected by the event, and whose views also needed to be considered. ‘Now that all the interviews are complete, we have properly established that there is no need for further police action.’ The incident, described as a 'fracas' by BBC officials, occurred when Clarkson discovered that the hotel where he was staying could not serve him a hot meal following a day's filming. An official report found that the 54-year-old presenter punched Mr Tymon in the mouth before being dragged away by a witness, causing the producer to go to A&E for emergency treatment. He also verbally abused him for 20 minutes, blaming Mr Tymon for failing to ensure that he could get a steak at the hotel. Victim: Oisin Tymon told police he did not wish to press charges against Mr Clarkson . Mr Clarkson was suspended as Top Gear presenter as soon as news of the fight came to light, and after the report was released the BBC announced that it would not renew his contract. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately, and the producer told North Yorkshire Police he did not want to see Mr Clarkson prosecuted. Despite his sacking, Mr Clarkson is set to take part in a series of Top Gear Live shows alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, although the performances will be rebranded. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to continue in some form, but Mr Hammond and Mr May are not expected to return. The star initially received widespread public support - including from his friend, Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the incident, while one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him. Trio: Mr Clarkson is still set to appear in Top Gear live shows alongside Richard Hammond and James May . But director-general

"Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp is confident his side can overturn a 2-1 Champions League first leg deficit against Juventus on Wednesday due to their watertight defence. The improving Germans, who have recovered after a dismal first half to the domestic season that saw them anchored in last place as recently as last month in the Bundesliga, have kept a clean sheet in their last three league games, including a 0-0 draw against Cologne on the weekend. With Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels back fit in central defence, along with full backs Marcel Schmelzer and Lukasz Piszczek, Dortmund's defence has been as solid as it has been all season. Jurgen Klopp talks to his Dortmund players during a training session ahead of the second leg with Juventus . (Left to right): Adrian Ramos, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Marco Reus . The Dortmund squad are put through their paces in training ahead of the crucial game against Juventus . Aubameyang (left) talks with Reus (right) as the Dortmund pair limber up in training with some leg stretches . '(Against Cologne) we played another game without letting in a goal and that is something we can build on,' Klopp told reporters. 'We want to advance to the quarter-finals and we can do this.' Dortmund boast a fine record at home in Europe having won 11 of their last 14 Champions League games at the Westfalenstadion. But in order to book a spot in the last eight they have to snap a losing run at home against Juventus, having lost all three previous encounters against the Italians in Dortmund. Klopp will be counting on goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has scored five in his last seven outings and in-form Marco Reus, who has struck five times in eight games. Marco Reus cancelled out Carlos Tevez's opener before Alvaro Morata scored a 42nd-minute winner . Juventus are flying high in Serie A, edging closer to the Italian title with their first triumph away from home in over two months at Palermo, opening up a 14-point lead. 'One less win needed to win the league,' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said, knowing he will now need to shift his focus to Dortmund and their attacking game. 'We will need to take the lead there, maybe score more than one goal,' said the coach. They will, however, be without influential playmaker Andrea Pirlo who has yet to fully recover from a thigh injury suffered in the first leg. 'He has made good progress but not enough to be in Dortmund,' the club said in a statement. Klopp knows that his side will have to be at their absolute best to overcome high-flying Serie A giants Juve . Dortmund have won 11 of their last 14 home ties in the Champions League at the Westfalenstadion .

"(CNN)Are we alone in the cosmos? Or might there be intelligent life elsewhere? Last week, NASA scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two. This year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun, 51 Pegasi. Since then, ground-based surveys and NASA's Kepler satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed ""exoplanets,"" and thousands more candidates await confirmation. Many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system. Some have large planets like Jupiter that orbit their stars far closer than Mercury, the innermost planet in our solar system. But smaller rocky planets like Earth, though harder to find, appear to be even more abundant. Life on Earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed. That suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life. Life as we know it is carbon-based and requires liquid water. Astronomers define the ""habitable zone"" around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet's surface. Any closer to the star, the water will boil into vapor; any farther and the water freezes into ice. Extrapolating from discoveries to date, astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion Earth-like, habitable-zone planets in our Milky Way galaxy alone. Of course, there is a difference between single-celled organisms -- which developed 3.8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals, which appeared about 200 million years ago. And then the humans, who have existed for only 200,000 years. Intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on Earth. So while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen, the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse -- even assuming they evolved as humans did, with ears and spoken language, or eyes and written language -- is likely to be tiny. And life that can use radio waves has existed on Earth for only 0.000002% of the planet's history -- 100 years out of 4.5 billion. If the half dozen or so rocky, Earth-like exoplanets now known are similar, the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as, well, winning your state lottery with one ticket. Of course, if there are 40 billion Earth-like planets out there, the odds improve quite a bit. If they all have histories like the Earth's, there might be 1,000 planets in the Milky Way that could support communicative beings. But before you start composing your first letter to an alien, think about this: The chance that those beings evolved on exactly the same time scale is minuscule. Another planet's 100 years of brilliance might have occurred a billion years ago, or it might happen a billion years in the future. A lot depends on how long communication capabilities last.

'That shows how much I believe in Gary,' the 23-year-old Sharpe said. 'It's definitely not just for the next five games, he's got a free hit at it really. If he keeps us up it's a miracle and if we go down it's expected by everybody in this room but Gary will back himself to keep us up. 'This is a long-term thing and we're looking forward to the future with him that gets us back to our identity on and off the pitch and bring the positive times back to this football club.'

"Chelsea have made an offer for FC Tokyo's 22-year-old forward Yoshinori Muto, according to club president Naoki Ogane. The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the £200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March . FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto . Muto tussles with Yuji Nakazawa of Yokohama F.Marinos during a J-League clash last month . Age: 22 . Club: FC Tokyo . Appearances: 37 . Goals: 16 . International caps (Japan): 11 . International goals: 1 . Did you know? Muto graduated from Keio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago . Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London. He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue. A £4million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club . Muto, pictured in action against Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season . The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year . He has continued his fine form during the current campaign, helping his club to third place in the division with three goals in four games. Yokohama Rubber - one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers - will become Chelsea's official shirt sponsors from the start of the 2015-16 season.

"Patrick Bamford wants to lead the line for Chelsea in the Premier League – but before then he could be leading Middlesbrough to the top-flight after inspiring this vital victory over Wolves. Boro boss Aitor Karanka said before the game that his team had to win all four of their remaining matches to finish in the top two of a claustrophobic Championship. And thanks to Blues loanee Bamford – creator of one for Jelle Vossen and scorer of the other - the Teessiders remain on course for what would be a deserved return to the top division. Patrick Bamford (second right) scored Middlesbrough's second goal as they beat Wolves on Tuesday night . Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1): Konstantopoulos; Kalas, Woodgate (Omeruo 62), Gibson, Friend; Clayton, Forshaw; Adomah (Amorebieta 80), Tomlin, Bamford; Vossen (Nsue 74). Subs not used: Ripley, Whitehead, Ledesma, Kike. Booked: Clayton. Goals: Vossen 3, Bamford 11. Wolverhampton (4-4-1-1): Ikeme; Iorfa, Batth, Stearman, Hause (Golbourne 45); Van La Parra (Jacobs 77), McDonald, Price (Dicko 63), Sako; Edwards; Afobe. Subs not used: Kuszczak, Henry, Doyle, Ebanks-Landell. Booked: Stearman, Batth, Sako, Edwards. Goal: Sako 63. Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire). Attendance: 20,520. Man of the Match: Patrick Bamford. Boro were relegated in 2009 and even the play-offs have been beyond them in the years since. This maximum at least guaranteed post-season participation, but they will want to avoid that scenario. And with the likes of Bamford in this kind of form they have every chance of going up automatically. Friday’s trip to Norwich, however, will go a long way to determining their fate in that respect. Karanka said: ‘We want more than the play-offs and the players showed that here. They were amazing in the first half. But this game demanded a lot of us mentally. We have to be ready for Norwich now, it is another huge game.’ Bamford, with 17, has now scored more league goals in one season than any other Boro player has achieved in the last 25 years. The 21-year-old makes no secret of his desire to one day return to Chelsea and challenge for a starting jersey. Karanka, though, could well be using his friendship with Jose Mourinho to secure another loan stay should they join the West Londoners in the Premier League. ‘For me, he is the best young player in the league. He is scoring goals and is showing he is mature, not just on the pitch but also in the changing-room,’ added the former Real Madrid assistant.

He said: 'Alcohol kills mold so I came up with this process to literally dip the pictures in alcohol and immediately kill it off. 'It also froze the image at that moment in time. It was like taking a snapshot of the picture in that damaged state. Taylor said the entire experience has 'been a roller coaster of emotions.' ‘[It] started off as a sense of total loss and devastation. But ultimately this has been a wonderful experience; a lot of great art came out of it and I'm happy with what was saved.' Taylor, from New York, USA, has enjoyed an amazing career that has seen him cover some of the most dramatic events of the 20th and early 21st Century.

"Jerusalem (CNN)A Palestinian teenager's name will be removed from an Israeli memorial commemorating fallen soldiers and the victims of terrorism after his family and others complained. Mohammed Abu Khdeir's name appeared this week on the wall at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl, the site of the national cemetery, as the nation prepared to mark its Memorial Day on Wednesday. Abu Khdeir, 16, was beaten and burned alive by three Israelis in July, according to prosecutors. A picture on the memorial website for Abu Khdeir shows an Israeli flag with two flowers called ""Blood of the Maccabees"" in Israel, a symbol often used on Memorial Day, when the country honors its soldiers killed in the line of duty and victims of terrorism. But Abu Khdeir's family objected to his inclusion on the memorial wall. His father, Hussein Abu Khdeir, said no one asked for his permission to put his son's name on the wall. ""I refuse that my son's name will be listed between soldiers of the occupation,"" he said. Almagor, an organization that works on behalf of victims of terror in Israel, also opposes Abu Khdeir's inclusion on the memorial. Almagor described the teen's death as a rogue attack and said he's not a terror victim. ""Somebody did here a trick, and we are going to fight to correct it,"" said Almagor CEO Meir Indor. ""We will not recognize someone who was murdered in a brutal way in an individual action."" Indor's organization wrote a letter to the National Insurance Institute of Israel -- the country's social security administration, which maintains the memorial site -- demanding that Abu Khdeir's name be removed from the memorial wall. Indor said if the teenager's name is not taken off, members of Almagor want their own family members' names removed. On Wednesday, Israel Radio reported that the National Insurance Institute of Israel will remove Abu Khdeir's name from the memorial following his father's complaints. The teen's name has already been removed from the organization's website, which lists the names on the memorial wall. A panel of judges began hearing evidence in January against the three suspects in Abu Khdeir's killing.

"A war of words appears to have erupted between two former rival stations who last week merged newsrooms. An account purporting to be Sydney radio station 2UE sent out a tweet on Thursday morning which appears to have come from a disgruntled former employee. 'Apologies for the s*** news service these days,' the tweet began. 'We hope you like the sound of whinging hyenas reading the news. #bringbackblanda', the post ended. What looks to a tweet from a disgruntled former radio employee emerged on Twitter on Thursday morning . The hashtag was in reference to the station's former newsreader Steve Blanda, who had read the news at 2UE for over a decade. While the tweet has since been removed from the @2UENews Twitter account, there is speculation online that it could have been sent by an employee displaced by the controversial merger. A 2UE spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they were aware of the posting but denied the message came from one of their accounts. They said it had not been used in years, and they believe it had been hacked, but by who they said they were unsure. Last Thursday the 90-year-old radio station 2UE broadcast its last ever bulletin out of the Sydney office, following a merger with rival station 2GB. Jobs were lost out of the Brisbane 4BC office, and at Magic 1278 IS Brisbane. 2UE in Sydney has just merged with rival station 2GB, which meant job losses from the newsroom and additional redundancies nationally . A 2UE spokesman said the new combined newsroom will be staffed by more than 20 journalists from both stations. Reporter Robert Spicer filed a brief story about the history of the station, which has covered every major news story for the most part of the last century including former prime minister Gough Whitlam's dismissal, the Beaconsfield mine disaster and the recent Sydney siege. '2UE has covered every significant news event over the past 90 years, with some of the best journalists in the country,' he said. Jason Morrison, a former 2UE breakfast and drive broadcaster, said the station took a financial hit after letting controversial ratings winner Alan Jones defect to 2GB in 2002. '2UE made some terrible decisions - whoever could let Alan Jones leave 2UE?,' he told AAP. 'That was the death knell, really, for the station.' Instead of local presenters in Sydney and Brisbane Alan Jones' (right) show will be broadcast in the breakfast slot, while Ray Hadley (left) will present mornings - both from their 2GB programs . Morrison, who is now spokesman for billionaire mining magnate Gina Rinehart, said it is a shame the longstanding 2UE-2GB rivalry was now over. 'When there is competition, there will be that desire to ensure that no stone's left unturned and there will be that desire to make sure that all angles are covered.' The 2UE spokesman said redundancies from the creation of the single newsroom in Sydney were regrettable but the right commercial decision for the broadcaster.

"Two years after his death, a remarkable twist of fate has meant a loving Navy father's message has finally reached his 10-year-old son. Joseph Torrez passed away two years ago, aged 41, after succumbing to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an incurable neurological disorder. The rapidly-progressing terminal illness eats away at the brain - causing dementia, memory loss, anxiety and psychosis - and affects motor skills and physical movements. Rowan Torrez, now 10, received the postcard (pictured) in the mail at the weekend, almost exactly two years after his father's death . Rowan and his father Joseph play together when he was a toddler. The young boy was his father's pride and joy, his mother Julie Van Stone said . Rowan (pictured) said he remembers his father as a 'very good person' Prior to the onset of the deadly disease, he moved away from his son Rowan, 10, to Boston, to gain two Masters degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 9News reported. And while studying or travelling home, he sent countless postcards to his only son reminding him how much he missed him. Now, just days away from the two-year anniversary of his death, his son Rowan has received an incredible gift in the mail. It was a postcard, dated June 10, 2007, which read: 'Hello from Pennsylvania. I love you, and I miss you so much. See you soon. Love, Daddy.' It was a touching moment for Rowan, who remembers his father as a 'very good person' and a good father and, as he told the broadcaster, a fitting final goodbye.

The pensioner, who was travelling in First Class on board the Boeing 777-300 jet, was allegedly restrained by cabin crew until the plane was forced into the unplanned landing. The flight crew alerted the pilot, who put a call in to the Irish Aviation Authority’s (IAA) North Atlantic Communications Service centre at Ballygirreen in Co Clare, who advised to land at Shannon. An 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board an Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto that forced a diversion to Shannon Airport .

MailOnline Travel have been advised by Irish police that the woman has since been released without charge, and she will be undergoing a 'fit-to-fly- screening in the hope of continuing her journey. There is no indication from the police as to the actions of the woman on board at this time. The decision was taken to divert when the Air Canada flight ACA-877 was around 600 miles north west of Shannon, and the plane, carrying 211 passengers, turned around. The Irish Times report that 'airport emergency services were standing by at strategic locations along the runway so that they could follow the aircraft once it had landed.' On touching down at Shannon Airport, the elderly woman was met by Irish police and taken into custody . As expected with unscheduled landings, the plane was forced to dump fuel in advance of the descent over the Atlantic. A spokesperson for Air Canada told MailOnline Travel: 'Our flight, AC877 on Friday, April 10, Frankfurt to Toronto, diverted to Shannon due to a disruptive passenger, who was removed from the aircraft.

"The mother of murdered British student Meredith Kercher is 'surprised and very shocked' by an Italian court's decision to overturn the convictions of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito. The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation, which was announced late last night, is the final ruling in the case, ending the long legal battle waged by Ms Knox and her ex-boyfriend. Ms Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy. Arline Kercher said she was 'surprised and very shocked' at the Italian court's decision. Here she is pictured during a press conference in Perugia, Italy, following Knox and Sollecito's original convictions in 2009 . Knox and Sollecito were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively before their convictions were overturned. Arline Kercher, Meredith's mother, said she had heard little more about the decision other than the verdict. She said: 'I am a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is about it at the moment. They have been convicted twice, so it's a bit odd that it should change now.' Asked whether she had any plans following the ruling, she said: 'I really don't know at the moment, I haven't got any plans. 'I can't see how evidence that was once deemed evidence is now no longer thought to be evidence. I am still shocked.' Talking about the Italian legal system she said: 'It is a long drawn out process.' She then added: 'If you write anything, never forget Meredith.' Meredith's father John declined to comment this evening. Ms Kercher (pictured left and right) was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 . Following Knox and Sollecito's original conviction, the two served four years in prison before a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years. Now Italy's highest court in Rome has overturned the second convictions and declined to order another trial. Both Knox, who was awaiting the verdict in her home town of Seattle, and Sollecito have long maintained their innocence.

"Rory McIlroy believes it is 'unthinkable' that he will not win the Masters at some point to complete the career grand slam. And the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at Augusta National in 2011 was the most important day of his career. McIlroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Rory McIlroy tees off at the Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament in Orlando on March 19 . 'For me now it's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved,' the 25-year-old said in an interview with BBC Northern Ireland. 'There's something special I can achieve going into Augusta this year. You are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses, different tests, different conditions. Not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome. It would just be incredible. 'You feel the sense of what can be achieved but I can't think about that too much. I just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as I can and if I can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else's.' McIlroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six Masters appearances, finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round. McIlroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at Augusta later this month . But the 25-year-old cannot picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket. 'During my career, yes it's unthinkable,' he added. 'If I don't win it this year...either it's not the right time or it isn't your time. If I was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket I'd obviously be very, very disappointed. 'And not just one.

"Your wedding is fast approaching and, as a last hurrah, you decide to celebrate in the most extravagant way possible - with a trip to ‘Space Vegas'. Here even a 'poor space miner can maybe strike it lucky at the zero-g roulette tables'. That’s the fantastic future imagined by one artist, whose awe-inspiring drawings of a next-generation space station in orbit reveal what space travel may one day look like. Taking one of several imaginative space planes, in this future timeline you’ll be partying to your heart’s content in an orbital extravaganza. Concept artist Alex Brady from Cambridge has created beautiful pictures of what space travel might look like. He imagines a space station of tomorrow similar to Las Vegas (shown in image), with neon lights and plenty of attractions . The images were created by concept artist Alex Brady, 32, from Cambridge in the UK, who normally works on video games and movies. But for these drawings he decided to try his hand at imagining what the future of space travel might look like. A space settlement would be a large structure, comparable in size to a town or small city, built in Earth orbit. It would have similar amenities and services to towns and cities on Earth, and would enable people to live in space. The ISS currently houses six astronauts at a time, but a space settlement would have hundreds or thousands of people on board. Future space settlements may also have artificial gravity by rotating around an axis. ‘It’s inspired by super yachts docking at the casino marinas in Monaco, as well as Macao and of course Las Vegas,’ he told MailOnline. ‘I liked the kind of trashy, flashy future in movies like The Fifth Element. ‘They’re absolutely preposterous but also cheerful and dynamic and irreverent.’ In the main image of Space Vegas, a fantastic array of colours and attractiosn can be seen, including a Ferris wheel and a lit-up cowboy. Several spacecraft docked at the space station can also be seen, based on similar designs for space planes. It is located in orbit around Earth, allowing planes to seemingly take off from Earth and then return to the planet with relative ease. The cone-shaped space station is also shown in a state of partial completion, with space planes again making the journey from the ground. ‘It’s inspired by super yachts docking at the casino marinas in Monaco, as well as Macao and of course Las Vegas [pictured],’ artist Alex Brady, 32, told MailOnline. ‘I liked the kind of trashy, flashy future in movies like The Fifth Element' The station is located in orbit around Earth, allowing planes to seemingly take off from Earth and then return to the planet with relative ease .

"A young Syrian boy has revealed how he saw depraved Islamic State militants playing football with a severed head inside the besieged Yarmouk refugee camp. Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he stumbled on the barbaric scene shortly after the terrorists beat him unconscious when they burst into his family home at the camp in the Syrian capital Damascus. The schoolboy said the ISIS fighters were looking for his brother, who is a member of the Palestinian rebel group who ran and defended the camp for several years before ISIS carried out a bloody assault that has left more than 200 people dead in just seven days. His story was revealed as refugees in Yarmouk spoke of the daily atrocities they have witnessed since ISIS seized control of 90 per cent of the camp, including innocent children being slaughtered in front of their anguished parents. Scroll down for video . Scene of death: A destroyed graveyard is photographed in Yarmouk camp following the intense fighting . Innocent: Palestinians, who fled the Yarmouk refugee camp, sit on mattresses inside a school in Damascus . After enduring two years of famine and fighting, Ibrahim Abdel Fatah said he saw heads cut off by ISIS in the Palestinian camp of Yarmouk. That was it. He fled and hasn't looked back. Unshaven, pale and gaunt, he has found refuge with his wife and seven children at the Zeinab al-Haliyeh school in Tadamun, a southeastern district of the Syrian capital held by the army. 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised,' he said. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved,' the 55-year-old said. The school is currently home to 98 displaced people, among them 40 children, who have been put up in three classrooms. The usual occupants, schoolchildren, have been evacuated temporarily from rooms where mattresses and bedding now blanket the floor. 'I left my house which was the only thing I had. My family lived on rations supplied by UNRWA,' the United Nations agency that looks after Palestinian refugees, the former caretaker said.

A man stands on a staircase inside a demolished building inside the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp . Anwar Abdel Hadi, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official in Damascus, said 500 families, or about 2,500 people, fled Yarmouk before IS fighters attacked the camp last Wednesday. Before the assault, there were around 18,000 people in Yarmouk in a southern neighbourhood of the Syrian capital. Yarmouk was once a thriving district housing 160,000 Palestinian refugees and Syrians. But that was before it too was caught up in the widespread civil unrest which erupted in 2011.

"Cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to Daily Mail readers . She was turned down for life-changing surgery on the NHS. But cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to Daily Mail readers. The three-year-old was denied NHS funding last year for the surgery at the same Leeds hospital trust which gave aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham breast enlargements. And even when readers raised £55,000 to pay for Sophie’s surgery her family were told by NHS doctors she was ‘not disabled enough’ to qualify – despite not being able to walk. But the toddler has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon Dr Tae Park in the United States this autumn. It means that, by the time she is four, Sophie could be walking. Sophie was born prematurely with spastic diplegia – a form of cerebral palsy. She needs the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery, which involves cutting the nerves in her spine, to be able to walk freely. Sophie has strengthened her legs ahead of the operation using a specially-adapted £1,200 bicycle bought from readers’ donations. Doctors said this means she is an ‘ideal candidate’ for the surgery and is likely to be able to walk completely unaided afterwards. Sophie’s mother Allison, 41, a nurse, said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved. She said: ‘Sophie wiped my face and she said “Mummy why are you crying?” I told her she was going to be able to walk and she said “Yes!”. ‘By the time she is four she could be walking. It’s very, very emotional, we just can’t believe it. ‘It is frustrating that Leeds turned us down but now we know that Sophie is going to have the best surgeon, so that is more reassuring. If anything goes wrong at least we know we did everything we could for her. ‘As it gets nearer I’m sure the nerves will kick in - it’s a big operation. But it’s what she needs and it’s the best thing for her. ‘Sophie understands now that she is going to walk. She knows Dr Park will “fix her legs” and she knows she is going on a big plane to get there.’ The three-year-old was denied NHS funding last year for the surgery, but she has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon Dr Tae Park in the U.S. Sophie’s mother Allison, 41, a nurse, said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved. She said: ‘If it wasn’t for the Daily Mail we wouldn’t be where we are now' Mrs Thomlinson said Sophie had progressed to standing up on her own since using the bike bought from readers’ funds, which meant doctors had told her they were ‘confident’ she would be able to walk after surgery.

"Voters are still 'in the dark' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day, economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on £30billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra £26billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly £3 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was £87.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from £98.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of £90.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than £60 billion from £153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of £1.48 trillion is more than £500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of £956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya

"Bangkok (CNN)Thailand has lifted martial law, replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta. Critics have expressed alarm at the move, with Human Rights Watch's Asia director Brad Adams saying it marked the country's ""deepening descent into dictatorship."" Martial law was lifted Wednesday when the Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved a request from Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha to proceed. Prayuth -- head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) junta -- immediately invoked Article 44 of the country's interim constitution ""to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability."" Article 44 states, in wide-ranging terms, that when the head of the junta believes it is necessary in the name of public harmony or to prevent the undermining of national security, then he has the power to act as deemed necessary. According to a statement issued by the NCPO, the new order grants military personnel powers to issue summons and arrest those who commit crimes against the royal family or against national stability, who commit crimes involving war weaponry, or who violate the orders of the NCPO. Designated military personnel were granted powers to seize assets, to block media from reporting or publishing, and to detain suspects up to seven days, the statement said. Unauthorized political gatherings of more than five people were banned, while those who defied NCPO orders could be imprisoned for up to a year, it said. Those who were detained could not leave the country without the approval of the head of the NCPO. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the new security order would allow Prayuth ""to issue orders without administrative, legislative, or judicial oversight or accountability."" ""Thailand's friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand by the junta leader to replace martial law with a constitutional provision that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers,"" Adams said in a statement. Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher on Thailand, told CNN the move would see Prayuth ""become a strongman with ultimate power in his hands to wield as he wishes."" ""This is a dangerous indication that the junta is not going to keep its promise to restore democracy and respect for human rights in Thailand,"" he said. Rupert Abbott, deputy director for Asia Pacific at Amnesty International, called in a statement for the NCPO to ""reinstate the rule of law and constitutional protections for human rights which the 2014 coup steamrolled over."" Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed alarm at the news. ""Normally I would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in Thailand,"" the High Commissioner said. ""But I am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian, which bestows unlimited powers on the current Prime Minister without any judicial oversight at all. This clearly leaves the door wide open to serious violations of fundamental human rights."" Martial law was imposed shortly before Thailand's military

"The family of a four-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted and murdered more than 75 years ago have accused police of a 'cover-up' after officers ordered that the case file be kept secret until 2040. Joyce Cox was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in Cardiff on September 28, 1939. The schoolgirl had been walking with her older brother Dennis, who was seven at the time, but she disappeared when he lost sight of her. Her body was found dumped by a railway station but police have never caught her killer. Now, Terry Phillips, 71, who is Joyce's cousin, has accused the Metropolitan Police of a 'cover-up' after the force said information could not be released about her murder because it is unfair to the mystery suspect. Joyce Cox was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in Cardiff on September 28, 1939. Her body was found but her killer has never been caught . The front page of the South Wales Echo shows the newspaper report following Joyce's death in September 1939, and reveals how officers want to track down a 'man with a slouch' in connection with her murder . Mr Phillips, who was not born at the time his relative was abducted and killed, used the Freedom of Information Act to find out more information about the case. He contacted the Met about the killing - the oldest unsolved murder in Wales - since the London-based force was drafted in to help South Wales Police with serious crimes at the time. He said that while he managed to establish that the force holds documents about the case, officers slapped an order on the file demanding it be kept secret for 100 years after the events concerned - until January 2040. A decision letter sent to Mr Phillips said: 'A named subject who was a suspect is described derogatorily and should not be associated with these matters. 'As an unsolved murder, with potential of re-investigation at any indeterminate stage, practice to close for 100 years is invoked. The family of Joyce (pictured) are accusing police of a 'cover-up' for not releasing paperwork on the case . 'However unlikely - indeed remote - it may be that this case is re-opened, we have to afford for that possibility. Putting information into the public domain will include naming specific persons who may yet be identified. 'These persons who may be living may have been witnesses and/or interviewees and who were not prosecuted and who therefore must be regarded as innocent parties. 'Persons will have given witness statements in the expectation that their information would not become public knowledge.' Mr Phillips said he 'does not accept the reason for refusing to release the documents'. He said: 'This smacks of a cover-up to me. As a result of this decision, which I am appealing against, I wouldn't get access to the file until I was 96, even

"Hedge fund trader Julian Rifat leaked insider tips about companies including Barclays and Volkswagen in exchange for a luxury car and holiday . A hedge fund trader who leaked insider tips about companies including Barclays and Volkswagen in exchange for a luxury car and a family holiday to Oman has been jailed. Julian Rifat, 45, abused his senior position at Moore Capital to leak tips about eight major firms. He used the inside information to place trades worth £285,000 through an associate to top up his basic salary of £125,000 and £615,000 bonus. Rifat, who lived in a £1.2million home in Oxford, was today jailed for 19 months during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court. His prosecution was the ninth under Operation Tabernula - an investigation launched in the wake of the financial crisis by regulators the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Rifat, once dubbed the 'face' of the American hedge fund, faced a single charge of insider dealing between 1 June and 24 November 2009. Prosecutor Mark Ellison QC, for the FCA, said: 'The total value of all eight trades being £285,000, they were all in the form of spread bets. '[Rifat] was employed at the time of offending as a senior trader by Moore Capital. He was FCA approved at the time of the offences and had been for a number of years. 'He was in essence, on the evidence, the person at Moore Capital in London that senior bankers would approach to discuss transactions. 'He was effectively, to a considerable degree, the face of Moore Capital in that respect for the purpose of European investment decisions. 'In fact in Mr Rifat's own words he says he was somebody who had direct access to the top four people in the firm. He was somebody who clearly was in a very responsible and trusted position.' Rifat would be approached by investors about major deals before the information was communicated to the market in a practice known as 'wall crossing'. Jailed: Rifat, from Oxford, leaked insider tips on major deals involving Barclays (pictured) and Volkswagen . However, he would then use this information to tip-off associate Graeme Shelley, a broker at Novum Securities Ltd, who placed trades on his behalf. In return, Shelley, 45, paid around £60,000, including a £15,000 family trip to Oman and a brand new Range Rover. Mr Ellison said: 'Once the inside was wall crossed within the company the entire firm was restricted from trading in the stock sharing until a public announcement was made or the offer withdrawn. 'After he had been wall crossed, Mr Rifat would make the time to give Mr Shelley either a ring or a text so as to provide the inside information.' Rifat, who worked in the company's London offices, was first arrested on his 41st birthday in 2010. Despite being put on administrative leave by his employers, he was still paid his huge salary as well as two £700,000 payments as part of a 'compromise agreement'. Rex Tedd QC, for Rifat, said his client was being paid cash that was owed to

"Mark Hughes has accused Steve Bruce of trying to ‘defend the indefensible’ over Maynor Figueroa’s tackle on Stephen Ireland that left the Stoke City midfielder with a deep gash in his calf. The Hull City manager responded to Hughes’ anger at the incident by insisting Ireland should already have been sent off following ‘the worst challenge on the pitch’ on David Meyler at the Britannia Stadium. A picture of Ireland’s bloody leg was revealed in the aftermath of the match but Bruce said: ‘I could show you a picture of Figueroa's ankle, he had five stitches in it and carried on.’ Ireland (left) sustained a deep gash on his leg after a challenge from Hull's Maynor Figueroa . Referee Neil Swarbrick did not give a free kick for the challenge that left Ireland with a gash in his leg . The challenge left a wound on Ireland's leg that Stoke boss Mark Hughes said needed 12 to 15 stitches . That has angered Hughes, his former Manchester United team-mate. ‘Steve has fallen into the trap of trying to defend the indefensible,’ said Hughes. ‘Everyone has seen the two challenges and I don't think there is any sort of comparison whatsoever. ‘The outcome is there for everyone to see so I don't think Steve did himself too much credit with his observation. ‘It's fairly easily to defend things - and I do it too - but on this occasion it was not as if the lad would be suspended. So why did Steve not just say, “It was a terrible tackle”? 'We're trying to move on but Steve did not need to do that. He did not need to say that. To defend that is incorrect.’ Stoke boss Mark Hughes has accused Hull City counterpart Steve Bruce of trying to 'defend the indefensible' Hull boss Bruce queried why Stephen Ireland was on the pitch after his challenge on David Meyler . Hughes added: ‘It looks likely Stephen is unavailable for two to three weeks. ‘Most people now have seen the picture and he’s had internal stitches as well as external, so it takes a little bit longer than a straightforward gash. ‘I’m disappointed as he was doing really well, filling the gap for Bojan.’

"The original suspect in the murder of an America’s Next Top Model contestant and three others was scheduled to be ejected from the US in 2012 but was granted deferred deportation under President Obama’s amnesty policy, it was revealed today. Emmanuel Jesus Rangel-Hernandez, 19, was arrested last month in connection to a triple-homicide in Charlotte, North Carolina, that claimed the lives of aspiring model Mirjana Puhar, 19, her 23-year-old boyfriend Jonathan Alvarado, and 21-year-old Jusmar Isiah Gonzaga-Garcia. His alleged accomplice, 19-year-old David Ezequel Lopez, was taken into custody Thursday and jailed on three counts of first-degree murder. Scroll down for video . Dreamer: Emmanuel Jesus Rangel (right), 19, charged with the murder of America's Next Top Model contestant Mirjana Puhar (right), was supposed to be deported in 2012 but was granted amnesty . According to a statement released by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and GOP Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rangel was permitted to stay in the country under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Records indicate Rangel, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was placed in the removal process by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after being charged with drug violations in March 2012. On December 18, 2012, however, removal proceedings were dismissed because Rangel was approved for deferred action under the DACA policy, despite his suspected affiliation with a street gang, of which ICE was allegedly aware. 'Accomplice': Second suspect David Lopez, 19, charged with three counts of first-degree murder in deaths of Mirjana Puhar, Jonathan Alvarado and Jusmar Isiah Gonzaga-Garcia . ‘This raises serious concerns about USCIS’s review and approval of other DACA applicants and points to potential vulnerabilities in the system’ Senators Grassley and Tillis wrote in a letter sent in February to the Department of Homeland Security requesting information about Rangel’s status. Under the amnesty program, which was enacted by President Obama's executive action, more than 675,000 young immigrants since August 2012 have been granted a work permit and reprieve from deportation. Republicans have long decried Obama's executive immigration as a form of backdoor amnesty that circumvents Congress. Homeland Security Department documents say participation in the program can be revoked at any time. US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which approves applications, reported to the House Judiciary Committee last year the government stripped that protection from 113 people as of August. The revocations included one case of gang membership, one aggravated assault, 11 driving-under-the-influence cases and 11 errors by USCIS, according to the committee. As recently as last week, 15 criminal immigrants protected form deportation under DACA were arrested in raid carried out by federal agents. On Thursday, a second suspect, David Ezequel Lopez, 19, was charged with killing the former America's Next Top Model contestant, her boyfriend and another man, in what police were calling a drug-related attack. Lopez voluntarily came to police headquarters to be interviewed. He was then transported to the Mecklenburg County Jail. In late February, investigators arrested 19-year-old Rangel and charged him with the slayings, which have been described as drug-related. Rangel has also been charged in a

Prison officers reportedly turned a blind eye to the partying, which happened in the run-up to Christmas in December last year. Tesfamichael was jailed for life with a minimum of 13 years after he used a broken champagne bottle to stab Olu Olagbaju, 26, in Shadan's nightclub in the City of London in December 2006. The music producer collapsed and died after the attack, where witnesses described seeing the young father being held with his arms behind his back before he was stabbed in the chest. Eritrean-born Tesfamichael, then 23 and living in Camden, north London, made his getaway in a Mercedes before fleeing to Italy and then Miami, U.S., before he was extradited back to Britain.

But the 74-year-old Brazilian icon feels that even if the young pretender can match his incredible feat, he will still not be considered in the same class as him. Brazil legend Pele says that even if Neymar matches his goalscoring record he still won't be the 'king' Neymar has 42 international goals at the age of just 23 and could easily catch Pele if he keeps up that rate . 'I think to be the new king, the new Pele, is impossible,' he said of Neymar. 'My mother and my father closed the machine. I think he's a good player, an excellent young player and he's going to be a big star, no doubt.' Brazil face France on Wednesday night in Paris and Pele feels that despite their humiliation at the last tournament on home territory, Brazil can prove to be an international force again ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. 'I think to be the new king, the new Pele, is impossible,' Pele said of his young pretender in the national team . Neymar leads the ball away from Dani Carvajal as Barcelona won El Clasico against Real Madrid on Sunday . When asked whether Brazil, being led once again by head coach Dunga, could win the title in Russia in three years time, Pele said: 'I hope so. 'I think with Dunga, (he) has a different style to Felipe (Scolari), more defensive, but I believe in Dunga. He could make a good national team.' Brazilian coach Dunga has Pele's backing, with the legendary forward saying he could win the World Cup .

"(CNN)Tunisia's tourism industry has been thrown into disarray by a terror attack on Wednesday that left at least 17 foreign visitors dead and prompted urgent warnings over security. Only just recovering from the impact of the Arab Spring uprisings four years ago, Tunisia has once again emerged as a winter sun draw for tens of thousands of travelers. But following Wednesday's attack and siege at the prestigious Bardo Museum in central Tunis, the country's tourism industry is once again facing jeopardy even as authorities and operators scramble to ensure the safety of visitors currently in the country. A significant number of foreign tourists were inside the museum at the time of the attack, which government officials said was the work of ""Islamists."" Prime Minister Habib Essid said Polish, Italian, German and Spanish tourists are among those killed, with another 20 tourists plus two Tunisians wounded in the attack. MSC Cruises said its ship, MSC Splendida, is currently docked in the Tunis port of La Goulette and some of its passengers had been on tours of the city, including the Bardo at the time of the attack. ""All the tourist coaches on tour were immediately recalled to the port and all other tours on the ground were immediately suspended,"" MSC said in a statement. Another ship, the Costa Fascinosa, docked in Tunis at that time, has a manifest of more than 3,000 passengers, its parent company Costa Cruise said. As details of the incident emerged, several foreign governments put out warnings urging their citizens to stay away from the scene of the attacks, around an area that includes the national parliament building. The U.S. Embassy in Tunis issued an alert that also reiterated standing advice about the potential for violence in Tunisia and the risk of kidnappings. Its warning cautions against trips to Tunisia's central, southern and border regions. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) also urged UK citizens to stay away from the affected areas of Tunis and to ""follow the instructions of Tunisian security authorities."" Its warning also carried longstanding advice: ""There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners."" With tens of thousands of foreign visitors likely to be in Tunisia right now and many more contemplating travel there, travel operators have been rushing to formulate a response to the attack. It's not immediately known if flights will be added to accommodate any sudden surge in departures or whether tour operators will pull out of the country -- responses that followed a terror attack in Kenya last year. Thomson and First Choice, a UK-based travel operator that carries thousands of vacationers on package trips to Tunisia, said it had canceled organized excursions to Tunis as a precaution. A statement said it would follow FCO advice, which overall remained unchanged for Tunisia. ""Thomson and First Choice customers stay in beach destinations, not Tunis, and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by the incident that took place there today,"" it said. ""As a precaution however we have

"A mere 53 hours to kick-off and all is serene at the training base of Queens Park Rangers. Mowers clip along on distant pitches as the sun beats down and the whitewashed pavilion is brightened by pots of forget-me-nots, a flower which could be adopted as the emblem of relegation. QPR boss Chris Ramsey appears relaxed and untroubled, insisting he had more sleepless nights coaching Tottenham last season and joking about the difference between Lidl and Waitrose. His job is to chase pressure and negativity away at times like this, but beneath the surface fear tightens its grip on those near the drop zone. QPR boss Chris Ramsey (centre) is one of seven managers trying to keep their club in the Premier League . Ramsey's side host West Ham on Saturday as they look to climb out of the relegation zone with four games left . Cesc Fabregas' 88th minute strike saw Chelsea grab a late 1-0 win at QPR earlier this month . It will be the same at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Leicester, Sunderland and Hull. Even at Burnley, where Sean Dyche was keen on Thursday to stress his club feel no pressure because their financial commitments are so much less than their rivals. ‘We are probably half the wage bill of the next team in the division, let alone all the superpowers, and half the spending of the next team in the division,’ said Dyche. The financial implications are bigger for others but there still exists a fear of sporting failure, a fear of letting people down, a fear of losing your job, your status, security, your self-esteem. These everyday, human anxieties trouble Premier League footballers, too. When Cesc Fabregas celebrated Chelsea’s winner in the 88th minute at Loftus Road two weeks ago, Ramsey curled into a ball on the touchline and bottled up his fury until he was well clear of the dressing room. ‘It was old-school,’ he smiled. ‘I was a little bit angry. The cat was running. I was so disappointed, probably the most disappointed I’ve been. It was a very soft goal and it would have given us a massive lift to know we could compete with a team of that calibre.’ Four of the bottom seven did not play in the Barclays Premier League last weekend and watched helplessly as Leicester won again, tightening the pack. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says his side have had to compete with the smallest wage budget in the league . NEWCASTLE . Swansea (Home) - April 25 . Leicester (Away) - May 2 .

"Pakistan-born bowler Fawad Ahmed has been tipped to give England a stern examination this summer after being called into Australia's Ashes squad on Tuesday. The 33-year-old, who sought asylum in Australia in 2010 before securing residency two years later, is one of 17 players selected for both the five-Test series and a preceding tour of the West Indies. Ahmed took 48 wickets during Victoria's triumphant Sheffield Shield campaign, catching the eye of national selector Rod Marsh, who feels the spinner can make life difficult for England's batsmen when the Ashes series starts in July. Fawad Ahmed celebrates after taking eight wickets for Victoria in the Sheffield Shield final last week . Ahmed bats for Victoria during the Sheffield Shield final with Western Australia in Hobart . 'Him being a leg-spinner as opposed to a finger spinner gave him a slight advantage,' Marsh said at a press conference organised to announce the squad. 'Believe it or not, Australia is always looking for leg-spinners. We've had a proud history of leg-spinning in this country and we want that to continue. '(Ahmed) doesn't bowl too much rubbish and he creates a lot of pressure. 'He has men around the bat in most instances and he keeps asking the batsmen questions, which is what good spinners do. 'He maintains good economy and asks questions of both left and right-handers, bearing in mind that England may have up to seven left-handers.' Ahmed pictured during a one-day international with England at Old Trafford in September 2013 . Ahmed has caught the eye of Australian selector Rod Marsh (left), seen here with Adam Gilchrist . There was no place for all-rounder Glenn Maxwell despite his World Cup heroics but Adam Voges, the scorer of 1358 runs in Shield cricket last season, will be on the plane departing for the West Indies on May 19. One-day specialist Maxwell, named in the International Cricket Council's team of the tournament following Sunday's triumph over New Zealand in Melbourne, made only 41 runs and failed to take a wicket against Pakistan in his last Test appearance for the Baggy Green back in October. Marsh said of Voges: 'I looked at him on four or more occasions and I thought 'I don't know how anyone will get this bloke out', he was that dominant. 'It wasn't just the 1300-odd runs, it was the way he made them. 'It was as good a Sheffield Shield batting as I have ever seen. Pure weight of runs, the way in which he got those runs, you could see Test player written all over him.' Adam Voges, seen here playing for Western Australia, has been selected after an excellent season . Glenn Maxwell has not been picked in the squad despite helping Australia to World Cup success . While fast bowler Ryan Harris is included, he will remain in Australia throughout the tour of the West Indies, which begins in Dominica on June 5, as he anticipates the birth of his first child.

"A filter-feeding 'lobster' as big as a human took the place of whales 480 million years ago, a new fossil find has shown. The 6.5ft (two-metre) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans, insects and spiders.

But while most of its relatives were shark-like apex predators with circular mouths ringed by sharp teeth, the new species, named Aegirocassis benmoulae, was a 'gentle giant'. The 6.5ft (two-metre) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans, insects and spiders. Like modern-day whales, it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food, using spine-covered 'limbs' on its head. Fossils also show that Aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body. These were likely to be precursors of the unique double-branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans.

Modern-day lobsters grow to around 19 inches (50cm) and modern-day whales average at around 79ft (25 metres). Dr Allison Daley, from Oxford University, who co-led a team studying Aegirocassis writing in the journal Nature, said: 'This would have been one of the largest animals alive at the time. 'These animals are filling an ecological role that hadn't previously been filled by any other animal. 'While filter-feeding is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food, previous filter-feeders were smaller, and usually attached to the sea-floor. 'We have found the oldest example of gigantism in a freely swimming filter-feeder.' A. benmoulae was named after the Moroccan fossil hunter who discovered it, Mohamed Ben Moula.

"Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion. Andre Ward, still ranked by many among the top five pound-for-pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring, sees Smith as the ideal warm-up opponent, possibly before a rematch with Carl Froch.

But it won't be for Andre's belt even though it will be over the 12-round championship distance.' The WBA have ordered their two super-middle world champions – Ward 'super,' Froch 'regular' – to meet in a unification fight. Froch declared willingness if Ward returns the compliment by travelling to the UK, having won their first meeting in the US.

But now it appears the WBA are granting the so-called Son of God licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights, in his native city across the Bay from San Francisco.

"(CNN)Ferguson City Manager John Shaw resigned Tuesday in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report. The report blames Ferguson, Missouri, police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets African-American residents. ""Over the last several months I have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community,"" Shaw wrote in his resignation letter. He continued: ""During this time I have also worked closely with the Department of Justice to identify opportunities to improve, and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change. ""And while I certainly respect the work that the DOJ recently performed in their investigation and report on the City of Ferguson, I must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target African Americans, nor falsify charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor. Any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false."" Shaw's resignation was announced the same day the City Council voted 7-0 on a mutual separation agreement with Shaw. Residents elect City Council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including the Police Department. Along with other officials, Shaw was heavily criticized by the Justice Department report, which found that authorities in Ferguson frequently saw residents as ""sources of revenue."" In fact, the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that Ferguson, population 21,000, was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in St. Louis County by having more than $1 million in revenue in 2010, the report said. In one March 2012 email, the captain of the patrol division reported to Shaw that court collections the previous month reached $235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $200,000. The city manager reported the email to the City Council, congratulating police and court staff on their ""great work,"" the report said. When Ferguson court revenues exceeded $2 million for the whole of 2012, the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email: ""Awesome! Thanks!"" according to the federal report. The DOJ's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in August. Wilson, who was not indicted on any charges, has resigned from the police department. But when Ferguson resident Sue Schmidt defended Wilson at Tuesday's City Council meeting, she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd. ""I'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe Darren Wilson an apology,"" Schmidt said, prompting laughter by some in the audience. ""The same justice report that you're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100%."" CNN's Jennifer Feldman, Holly Yan, Sarah Aarthun and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

"A New York college has provoked anger after postponing its screening of movie American Sniper in response to complaints from Muslim students. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday. It said it will still show the Oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film. Bradley Cooper in his Oscar Nominated role as Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in US military history . The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (pictured) in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday . The film was postponed because senior management at the college did not want to create animosity or tension among its students. However they appear to have done just the opposite. Following complaints from the RPI’s Muslim Students’ Association a number of students have said the postponement was an act of censorship and an attack on free speech, Fox News reported. While the film grossed a total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis . A statement from the university explained the aim of the screening, coupled with the now scheduled educational forum, was to allow students in the campus community to ‘participate in an intellectual discourse about the film and current world events’. American Sniper, a film by Clint Eastwood about US Navy Seal sharp-shooter Chris Kyle the most deadly sniper in US history, has courted controversy since it was first shown in the US in November. While the film grossed an international total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis. It was also accused of stoking racial hatred after screenings of the film led to a rise in threats against Americans of Middle Eastern origin and even some attacks on Muslims outside movie theaters. Earlier this month the University of Michigan flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus. The college pulled a screening over student complaints but quickly did an about-face after news of the cancellation sparked a firestorm on campus. The school released statement saying the decision to cancel had not been consistent with the high value it placed on freedom of expression. Navy Seal and Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle, depicted in the film, was killed at a shooting range in Texas . The school's vice president for student life, E. Royster Harper, acknowledged that it was ‘a mistake’ to call off the screening. ‘The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location,’ Harper’s statement read. ‘We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern.’ An Alternative screening of the Paddington Bear movie was offered to those students who did not want to watch the American Sniper. Earlier this month the University of Michigan (pictured) flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus .

Satisfied, it then goes to fly away home when suddenly it notices that it is stuck and a sense of panic sets in. Realising that its tongue is stuck to the frozen beef steak, the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free . Moving its legs, the fly at first attempts to walk away, before arching its back and trying with all its might to pull itself free. It tries this two more times, but much to its annoyance it stays attached to the beef steak as it stops to look at the camera. As the video goes on the fly tries harder and harder to set itself free – beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly. The fly tries hard to set itself free by beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly . But nothing seems to work and as it slumps, looking sorry for itself, all appears to have been lost. Luckily for the fly however, help emerges in the form of a human thumb, which attempts to set it free with a little prod. Failing this, the video maker then picks up a little heat gun and begins thawing out the ice around the fly and ultimately setting it free. The video was recorded in Auckland, New Zealand. The fly appears to give up hope but eventually the video maker intervenes and sets the creature free .

Aly admitted to the mistake to the audience, pointing out that the footage they’d used earlier was of two different people. ‘We stuffed that up, viewer Prue Knox was quick and tweeted us within minutes, so thank you Prue,’ Aly said. ‘Yes, so that happened,’ he continued, clearly embarrassed. ‘That’s certaintly something to talk to Michael about tomorrow,’ Georgie Coghlan laughed. ‘Maybe we can just get him to sit in this seat and see if anyone notices,’ Aly said pointedly. Pharoah saw the funny side of the incident and shared viewers’ tweets about the blunder on his own account. ‘The Project just played a a few clips for upcoming guest Michael Che and 2 of the clips were of Jay Pharoah #AWKWARD,’ tweeted Prue Knox. ‘Hey The Project, you do know that Michael Che and Jay Pharoah are two different people yeah? #ouch,’ Susan Bong tweeted, accompanied with a video of the gaffe. Presenter Waleed Aly apologised for the mix-up, which was ironic as he was the subject of a strikingly similar mix-up earlier this year . The Age incorrectly printed a photo of 'Legally Brown' comedy star Nazeem Hussain, who's of Sri Lankan decent, in its entertainment column with the caption: 'Waleed Aly joins The Project' Ironically Waleed Aly, the presenter who apologised for the error, was the subject of a strikingly similar mix-up earlier this year. The Age incorrectly printed a photo of 'Legally Brown' comedy star Nazeem Hussain in its entertainment column in January with the caption: 'Waleed Aly joins The Project'. The awkward mistake was spotted by Hussain, a stand-up comedian of Sri Lankan descent, who lightheartedly tweeted on Thursday morning: 'Well, we are kinda the same person...' The error sparked a widespread response, with social media users posting comments such as: ‘Oh, so brown people all look alike?', 'Un-freaking-believable' and 'demonstrates why tv needs more non-white face'. Waleed Aly apologised for the embarrassing ‘stuff up’ later on during the program after the mistake was flagged

They would play for 'Team South' - comprised of stars from La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 - against a similar 'North' dream team from the Premier League, Bundesliga and Russian Premier League. Mundo Deportivo report that a marketing company has approached UEFA and proposed the annual fixture, which is inspired by the NBA All-Star Game between the Western and Eastern Conferences.

Messi and Ronaldo would be the star attractions in the 'North vs South' All-Star fixture . South: Buffon; Danilo, Sergio Ramos, Pique, Thiago Silva; Messi, Pogba, Koke, Neymar; Cristiano Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic . North: Neuer; Terry, Hummels, Alaba; Robben, Di Maria, Silva, Reus; Alexis, Aguero, Hazard . The players involved would be chosen by an online fan poll, with no more than three players from any club side. But despite such restrictions, the proposed match would throw up the tantalising prospect of Barcelona;s Messi and Neymar joining forces with Real Madrid stars Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Other possible stars in the 'South' team include Paris Saint-Germain forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. The 'North' side could feature Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero, Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Manchester United winger Angel di Maria and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar could also feature in the proposed All-Star match . Zlatan Ibrahimovic would likely lead the line for the 'South' Europe dream team in the game .

See what happened in our North England vs South England Premier League clash simulated by Football Manager . The fixture would naturally draw a massive audience all around the world and the television and sponsorship rights commanded would ensure a nice payday for UEFA and the company involved.

"Cocaine use in Britain has trebled in two decades, with a new 'phenomenon' of rising drugs consumption among people in their forties and fifties. A new government report launched amid concern that cocaine is seen as safe found it is no longer 'the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities'. Its authors found the drug is now 'firmly embedded in UK society', and warned launching an anti-cocaine campaign could encourage more people to take it. Cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens, but there have been significant increases among people in their forties and fifties . The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said the drug has spread throughout all areas of society since the mid-1990s. It follows the emergence of a market in cheap, low-purity powdered cocaine that operates alongside a more expensive and far higher purity version of the drug. A line of the cheaper version can now be bought for just £2 – less than the price of a coffee. Cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens but while usage among younger age groups has fluctuated in recent years, figures from the Office for National Statistics show the percentage of over-35s taking cocaine at least once in the past year increased from 0.8 per cent in 2001/2 to 1.5 per cent in 2013/14 – the equivalent of about 188,000 men and women. Over the same period, use among adults described as ‘comfortably off’ rose from 1.5 per cent to 1.9 per cent. Overall just over 810,000 men and women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales used the drug at least once last year – 2.4 per cent of the population. It is the highest rate in Europe. Use among older adults has been less common, particularly among 45-54 year olds. In 2013-14, 1.8 per cent of people aged 34-44 took cocaine up from 1.3 per cent a decade earlier. Among 45-54-year-olds the figure doubled from 0.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent. But the report said: 'It is notable that there have been statistically significant increases (1996 to 2013-14) across all age groups up to the age of 54 years; a phenomenon that has not been observed in respect of other drug types.' It could be that more people are taking up cocaine later in life, but the data suggests it is the result of 'continued use among an ageing user cohort', suggesting age does not lead to people giving the drug up. The access to cheap cocaine - often mixed with harmful cutting agents - is 'highly likely' to have driven the rise in the number of users from 'hard pressed' or low income backgrounds, as well as the 'comfortably off', living outside cities where drug use was traditionally uncommon. The report, addressed to Home Secretary Theresa May and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is the first of its kind to investigate powdered cocaine use and was launched in response to fears of a perception that the drug is safe as use increased.

"Swansea manager Garry Monk believes a strong finish will put a different slant on Everton's season - but he is determined to stop his former manager Roberto Martinez profiting at his old Liberty Stadium stomping ground on Saturday. Martinez was lauded by Everton fans last season as the club qualified for Europe with a fifth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League. But the going has been a lot tougher for the Spaniard in his second season on Merseyside with Everton having only removed the spectre of relegation by winning their last three matches. Garry Monk wants Swansea to continue their own impressive form with victory over Everton on Saturday . Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) scored twice for Swansea in their 3-1 victory over Hull last weekend . Ki Sung-Yueng (second right) also got on the scoresheet as Swansea maintained their impressive form . Vandals even defaced the outside of Goodison Park with 'Martinez Out' and 'Not Good Enough' sprayed on the wall of a stand in white paint, but Monk insists that is simply a part of modern-day football when results do not go your way. 'I always say you're only a few games away from being great or rubbish,' Monk said. 'Roberto is a good manager, but sometimes you have good periods and sometimes you have bad ones. 'It's just making sure you come through them and he's won the last three games, they're back on the up and he'll want to finish the season strongly. 'Of course they'd want to be pushing further up the league and it's not a position you'd associate with Everton. 'But if they can get back up to finish positively it will put a different twist on the season.' Everton have had to balance their domestic commitments with a demanding Europa League campaign which saw them knocked out at the round-of-16 stage last month. And Monk knows from Swansea being in the competition last season how much that has an impact on Premier League performances and results. 'Europe is tough, the travelling and constant games in certain periods,' Monk said. 'It all adds up and the intensity of the football at this level takes it out of you and takes its toll. 'Whether it (Everton's results) is all down to that I don't know, but it does play a major part and if you look at the teams who have played in the Europa League, including ourselves, it has had an impact.' Swansea have never beaten Everton in the league but they claimed a point at Goodison Park in November after being reduced to 10 men following Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal. Martinez criticised Swansea's 'strange' tactics and style of play that day but Monk put it down to 'more frustration with his own side and not winning the game'.

"A Western gray whale has made the longest known migration by any mammal. The female, named Varvara, swam 14,000 miles (22,500km) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back, without even stopping for a snack when she was nine years old. Her return journey across the North Pacific raises questions about the critically endangered creature’s conservation status. A Western gray whale (pictured) has made the longest known migration by any mammal. The female, named Varvara, swam 14,000 miles (22,500) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back, reportedly without stopping for a snack . Until now, scientists believed there were two distinct groups of gray whale - the Eastern gray whale, which travels along the west coast of US, and the much rarer Western gray whale, which journeys along the coast of eastern Asia. The researchers used satellite-monitoring tags to track three Western North Pacific gray whales from their primary feeding ground off Russia’s Sakhalin Island across the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the US to Baja, Mexico. The experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of Russia for years and tracked the record-breaking journey over five-and-half months between 2011 and 2012. Gray whales typically don't feed during migration, which has led researchers to believe Varvara didn't eat during the long journey either. They found that Varvara, which is Russian for Barbara, visited the three major breeding areas for Eastern gray whales, which are found off North America, according to the study published by the Royal Society in the journal Biology Letters. Her return journey across the North Pacific raises questions about the critically endangered creature’s conservation status. Experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of Russia for years and tracked the record-breaking journey between 2011 and 2012. A Western gray whale is shown . ‘It is very impressive,’ Professor Bruce Mate, of Oregon State University, told MailOnline. ‘These whales have the same body temperature as you and I, so they are obliged to make these big journeys to get to warmer or cooler waters. But this is a record.’ ‘Until now we thought they were not very good navigators,’ he continued. Varvarva is a 13-year-old Western gray whale. She is now famous for making the longest migration of any mammal when she was aged nine. The whale was tagged off Russia's Sakhalin Island in September 2011. Experts expected her to swim along Asia's Pacific shoreline down to the South China Sea. But instead, she turned up off Mexico's Baja Peninsula instead and mingled with Eastern gray whales near their nursery lagoon in Mexico. Experts tracked Varvara to find that she made a swam 14,000 miles (22,500) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back. Her journey is helping scientists make a surprising new discovery about migration patterns. ‘We thought that they just stuck to the coast, keeping the sound of the surf on one side, going up and

"(CNN)The United Nations is appealing for $174 million to help Nigerian refugees who've fled to neighboring nations following militant attacks. Boko Haram has killed thousands in the nation's northeast by attacking villages, schools, churches and mosques. It has also kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls abducted in April last year. A majority of them remain missing. The militants have attacked relentlessly for six years, sending 192,000 people seeking shelter in Cameroon, Niger and Chad. ""Displaced people in northeastern Nigeria and across borders are in a very dramatic situation, they fear for their lives and are at this point unable to return to their homes,"" said Liz Ahua, who's coordinating Nigerian refugee efforts for the U.N. Aid agencies are scrambling to provide the refugees with clean water, shelter, food and access to education. ""In the refugee camps, thousands of school-age refugee children cannot attend school because of lack of classrooms and teachers,"" Ahua said. Mental health needs are crucial to help the survivors of physical attacks and those who've witnessed violence, according to the U.N. Some children are separated from their parents amid the trauma. ""The conflict has had a devastating impact on children, including many who were forcibly recruited by the insurgents in Nigeria,"" Ahua said. The appeal encompasses the needs of 23 agencies and nongovernmental organizations helping the refugees. ""Adequate funding is crucial to make sure aid agencies can improve the living conditions for refugees in asylum countries and respond to their protection needs,"" Ahua said. ""We relocate refugees away from the conflict border areas, and establish additional refugee camps where needed."" The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. An additional 1.2 million people are displaced within Nigeria as a result of the insurgency. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report .

"Extra-curricular: John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, says pupils need more than just A*s . The glut of top grades at GCSE and A-level is forcing employers to focus on young people’s extra-curricular activities, according to a business leader. John Cridland – director general of the Confederation of British Industry – said his members must consider character-building elements of a candidate’s CV, rather than just qualifications. He told the Times Educational Supplement that ‘frankly everybody has A*s’ and said employers want someone who ‘stands out from the crowd’. ‘What have you done in the local theatre club? 'What have you done in the local sports club? 'What have you done to put something back into the community?’ he said. ‘[These] are just as important to employers.’ He added that most bosses ‘do not recruit on subject or qualification’ but look for ‘enthusiasm, creativity and passion’. The CBI has previously bemoaned the poor quality of candidates entering the workplace, criticising levels of numeracy and literacy. However Mr Cridland stopped short of suggesting ‘character’ should be taught as a separate subject, saying: ‘A good teacher develops these things in the classroom while teaching English.’ He added that Ofsted inspections should focus more on the all-round development of pupils.

"Palmerston remains a very painful place for Rangers managers. Consider this the first harsh lesson of Stuart McCall’s tenure. Back in the chill of mid-December, Ally McCoist led the Ibrox side here on the day it emerged he had handed in his notice of resignation. A convincing 2-0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club. Nine days later, McCoist was out on gardening leave. Fast forward almost five months, and Rangers arrived here in far more ebullient spirits with a new boardroom regime installed and three successive victories under McCall’s command. That Hibs and Hearts were among the victims added to the sense of a substantial revival. In Dumfries, however, it felt more like a flashback to the bad old days of their campaign. Rangers were simply second-best all over the plastic pitch in Dumfries . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park . Lewis Kidd celebrates after an own goal doubles Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half . Gavin Reilly (left) celebrates after forcing an own goal for QOTS's third to dent Rangers' second place hopes . Queen of the South: Clark, Durnan (Hooper), Dowie, Higgins, Kidd, McShane, Carmichael, McKenna, Holt, Lyle (Pickard), Reilly (Russell) Subs: Paton, Atkinson, Smith, Smith . Booked: Higgins . Scorers: Lyle 33', Wallace (og) 46', Reilly 69' Rangers: Robinson, McGregor, Zaliukas, Mohsni, Wallace, Templeton (Crawford), Law, Murdoch, Vuckic, Miller (Hardie), Clark (Boyd) Subs: Black, Shiels, Simonsen, Sinnamon . Booked: Templeton, Moshni . Ref: Don Robertson . Att: 5,093 . Immense credit must go to Queens, who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play-off hopes. Under James Fowler, they are capable of bright, energetic football that delivered goals from Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly, as well an own goal from Lee Wallace. McCall, though, must have felt a twinge of despair. He has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift. That so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion. A first defeat of his six-game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion. The Ibrox outfit remain third behind Hibs on goal difference, albeit with a game still in hand. Radical improvement is once again required when they host Raith Rovers on Sunday. Queens will face Falkirk at that same time, having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play-off spot. This was the best possible fillip for Fowler’s men, as they seek to grow that one-point advantage. Ranger's Newcastle loanee Haris Vukic (left) attempts to block a shot by QOTS' Chris Higgins .

"Retirees are returning to work in their droves as many seek to boost their pension income, figures suggest. One in eight workers aged 65 to 74 were not in employment a decade earlier – either because they were retired, unemployed or caring for a loved one. The Office for National Statistics study suggests thousands of so-called 'boomerang pensioners' are returning to employment for financial reasons or because they miss working. Retirees are returning to work in their droves as many seek to boost their pension income, figures suggest . More than a third of those who had come back to work were retired ten years previously. Women were even more likely to come out of retirement than men. Workers from Wales and the north of England were the most likely to return to work after not working in their late fifties and early sixties. Lisa Harris, of over-50s specialist firm Saga, said: 'News that older people are returning to work is good, however scratch below the surface and it reveals that for some this decision isn't always entirely driven by choice. 'Many older men and women may have had to retire to care for loved ones or to help look after their grandchildren. But when these caring responsibilities subside, many find they need to return to work either for financial reasons, or simply to keep themselves busy. 'In addition there will have been relatively large numbers of people who decided to retire early, but have found that the dream of retirement has failed to live up to their expectations, either financially or socially.' Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: 'For those that do return to work, more often than not the only jobs available are low-paid and part-time.'

"Former footballer Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence which happened just days before he attempted suicide. The 35-year-old, who played for Leeds, Burnley and QPR, today admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted his Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner. Former footballer Clarke Carlisle has admitted failing to provide a sample when he was suspected of drink driving. Days after he was pulled over by police, he attempted suicide . Carlisle still bears the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January. The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman spoke clearly as he admitted the charges from the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London today. Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14. She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation. The court heard he was spotted by police 'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting another vehicle on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am. Prosecutor Zahid Hussain said the car was seen 'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'. When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added. The court was told that Carlisle did not blow long enough in the breathalyser when he was tested at the roadside to provide an adequate sample. Carlisle later said he fell into a spiral of decline after his contract as a TV football pundit was cancelled . He was taken to Islington police station but would not co-operate and said: 'Sergeant, I would like to speak to my counsel first.' The court was told that Carlisle had been involved in excess-drinking offences in 1999 and 2011. Krystelle Wass, defending, told the court: 'Two days after the incident Mr Carlisle attempted suicide, which is why matters have taken some time to come to court.' She said there were 'ongoing mental health issues'. The deputy district judge replied that she would order reports ahead of the next hearing as 'he is clearly in some trouble'. The deputy district judge told Carlisle that he would get credit for his early guilty plea but noted that he has a 'bad record'.

Roger Federer beat Diego Schwartzman in straight sets to reach Indian Wells third round . Argentine Schwartzman was comfortably swept aside 6-4 6-2 by dominant Federer in California . Federer hardly broke sweat in progressing and will now face Andrea Seppi in the next round . And Federer feels his decision to not just 'chase money or more tournament victories' over the years has allowed him to stay competitive. 'The idea was always (about) trying to be around the game for a long time,' he said. 'And for that in 2004, when I became world No. 1, I took a decision with my fitness coach at the time that we're going to plan long-term. Whatever we will do, we will plan long-term. 'Sure, we can chase money or more tournament victories. We can play more frequently, train harder, whatever we will do. But we decided we will try to stay around 20 tournaments during the year, which is a lower number.' Ominously for his rivals Federer believes such an approach has led to him playing some of the best tennis of his career.

"As five years as Prime Minister David Cameron should have a decent stock of anecdotes to keep a room of voters entertained. But in an advert break for last night's TV election contest the Tory leader took the chance to perform his own party trick. In front of more than 100 voters and studio crew, he recited a verse from his favourite childhood song: Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West). Scroll down for video . David Cameron revealed the only song he knows the words to is Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West), before reciting the first verse . Initial reports that the Prime Minister had burst into song were disappointingly wide of the mark. During a break he told Sky News presenter Kay Burley how the chart-topping song by Benny Hill was the only one he could sing in full. She tweeted: 'Just heard from PM that he can sing Ernie and nothing else...' The Premier could not be persuaded to showcase this talent, but did prove his love of the song by reciting the first verse. Burley added: 'He didn't sing but he did recite 'you could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground...' Mr Cameron's love of the song first emerged in 2006 when he appeared on Desert Island Discs and revealed it would be one of the songs he would take to the fictional island. 'This really just reminds me of my childhood,' he said at the time. 'When you are asked to sing a song, this is, I'm afraid, the only song whose words I can remember.' The private rendition for the audience in last night's TV studio might explain why he got a relatively easy time from them when the cameras went live. While Mr Cameron was asked about treating the elderly with dignity and the depth of spending cuts, Mr Miliband faced a series of aggressive questions. Mr Cameron waves to the audience after taking questions in the first TV contest of the general election campaign . The Tory leader's first question from the audience was: 'What do you think are Ed Miliband's best qualities?' One of the few off-the-cuff questions from Burley to the PM was: 'Have you ever had three shredded wheat?' When Mr Miliband face the audience, he was first asked: 'You sound gloomy most of the time, are things really so bad?' Another asked: 'Do you not think that your brother would have done a better job? He was better qualified and better positioned.' Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband faced the wrath of voters - and Jeremy Paxman - last night as they were forced to defend their broken promises, judgement and ability to lead the country in the first prime-time TV contest of the general election.

"After supposedly inventing Mother's Day in his country four years ago, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has taken his unlikely stance on gender equality a step further. During a visit to an airbase yesterday, the despot hailed International Women's Day by handing out free make-up and sending congratulations to the wives of airmen in honour of the occasion. While not meeting any of the men's partners in person, he was said to have asked commanding officers to pass on his gifts of food and cosmetics. Unlikely feminist: Kim Jong-Un, pictured on a official airbase visit yesterday, is mobbed by female workers after publicly recognising International Women's Day . His recognition of gender rights comes one week after female defectors in Seoul claimed women in North Korea do not receive sex education, are subjected to forced abortions and in the military are required to perform sexual favours on high-ranking men, the Independent reports. North Korean paper Rodong Sinmun recently put forward the country's feminist credentials while criticising the 'discrimination against women workers protested in South Korea', who KCNA said were unable 'to live as human beings'. Meanwhile, KCNA's main report on the anniversary of 'Kim Jong-il's work and International Women's Day' said the country had 'demonstrated its might as an example of the progressive women's movement of the world under the wise guidance of peerlessly great men'. 'The Korean women's movement greets the heyday of its development as it is led by Marshal Kim Jong Un,' it added before hailing Kim as the inventor of 'Mother's Day, the first of its kind in Korean history' - four years ago. Airbase visit: The leader told airmen to congratulate their wives and also gave them gifts of make-up . Pearls of wisdom: The secretive despot appears to offer advice to kitchen workers at the airbase unit . As well as his nod to International Women's Day, the leader took the opportunity to heap praise on his late father Kim Jong-Il, noting his 'patriotism, faith, anti-imperialist class education and moral education', according to the Rodong Sinmun report. During the visit, the leader also demonstrated his green credentials after reportedly highlighting the need to develop wind, solar and geothermal energy to solve electricity problems. Much of North Korea's 24 million population experience power cuts every day. Inspecting facilities: During the tour, Kim inspected a new power station and also took the opportunity to tour the site's training facilities as well its washroom, kitchen, greenhouse and mushroom cultivation room . Green stance: Kim reportedly also highlighted the need to develop wind, solar and geothermal energy to solve electricity problems during a speech .

John Guidetti will be defending this charge.’ Meanwhile, the club has been hit with a combined £9,460 fine for two UEFA charges of misconduct during the second leg of last month’s Europa League showdown with Inter Milan in Italy. A penalty of £5,860 was imposed for ‘improper conduct’ on the field as well as a £3,600 punishment for flares set off by fans at the San Siro. Guidetti (left) is said to have made a slur about Rangers and has until Monday to appeal the charge . Defender Virgil van Dijk was sent off for two bookable offences, while five other players were booked in the 1-0 loss which saw Ronny Deila’s men eliminated 4-3 on aggregate. It’s the seventh time the club has been in hot water with the governing body in four years. Inter were also fined £3600 for their supporters letting off fireworks. Three flares were lit in the Celtic end during the Europa League clash with Inter Milan at the San Siro . Celtic responded to the latest fine in a statement which read: ‘Clearly, Celtic Football Club is disappointed by today’s decisions. ‘It should be noted that Celtic players have an excellent disciplinary record in European football over many years and in Scotland, Celtic has been top of the league’s disciplinary table for the last three years, something which we are rightly proud of. ‘Again, it is disappointing that the actions of one or two individuals within a support of well over 3,000, have let the club down by using flares at this match.’ Virgil van Dijk (third left) looks away as he is dismissed in the first half for Celtic against Inter last month .

"Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde has told Ireland not to expect the same Welsh mistakes made in Dublin last year. Ireland ran out convincing 26-3 winners when the two teams last met at the Aviva Stadium in February 2014 but McBryde admits the Welsh management could have prepared the side better for that contest. And, with Ireland's visit to the Millennium Stadium on March 14 shaping up to be the game that could decide the destiny of this year's RBS Six Nations title, McBryde insists Wales will be ready this time. Gordon D'Arcy surges through for Ireland as they beat Wales 26-3 in last year's tournament . Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde has told Ireland not to expect the same Welsh mistakes as last year . 'I know from a coaching point of view we looked at ourselves and weren't happy with the way we prepared for the game that week,' McBryde reflected on Wales' visit to Ireland 13 months ago. 'We did not have the intensity in training leading up to that match and we were exposed on the day. 'We weren't pointing fingers, we were looking at ourselves as to how we could have prepared better for that game. 'It was a bitter pill to swallow because we were well-beaten and it was the first time in a long time that had happened to us. 'We really struggled to cope with their driving game but we've worked worked hard in that area and the boys showed against France what they're capable of doing.' Wales' 20-13 victory in Paris has revived Welsh hopes of doing what they did in 2013, namely becoming Six Nations champions after losing their first game in the tournament and they were boosted on Friday when skipper Sam Warburton and Dan Biggar returned to training after suffering knocks in France. Wales captain Sam Warburton (centre) is expected to play against Ireland after suffering a knock . But Ireland are three-fifths to a Grand Slam having beaten England in Dublin last weekend and McBryde accepts Wales face a big challenge to record their first win over the men in green since 2012. 'They're a very formidable outfit as they've proven,' McBryde said. 'You've got to have your wits about you playing them in regards to the tactical and technical approach to the game. 'But the France game was a reflection of what the players have been doing in training and some of the execution and accuracy under pressure which we we speak about constantly came to fruition. 'We've set the standard and now we've got to do it again.'Â .

"Beaming towards the camera as a toothy 10-year-old, Carl Thompson is the picture of health as he poses in his family's back garden. But more than 20 years later the once rosy-cheeked boy is facing death after ballooning to 65 stone to become Britain's fattest man. Consuming 10,000 calories-a-day by gorging on takeaways and whole loaves of bread, the 32-year-old is too heavy to walk or wash himself. He is confined to the ground floor flat where he lives alone in Dover, Kent, kept company by a team of NHS carers who come to bathe him and cook for him every day. Scroll down for video . Carl Thompson, 32, has gained an astonishing 30 stone in just three years and is now bed-bound at 65 stone . Mr Thompson said he has always had problems with food and was even caught raiding neighbours fridges when he was three (left). But aged around 10 he was a normal size and played like a normal child . Living off a combination of incapacity benefits and a disability allowance, Mr Thompson spends roughly £200 every week on takeaways and online food shopping. He has not had a job since he was 17 when he worked in a food factory. At the time Mr Thompson said he ate everything the factory didn't sell. But after the death of his mother in 2012 from a brain tumour, Mr Thompson turned to food as a means of coping with his grief. Breakfast: Four sausages, five fried eggs, fried bread, mushrooms fried in butter, bowl of cereal with full fat milk . Lunch: Bowl of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate . Dinner: Chinese or Indian takeaway of up to £25 five nights a week . Snacks: £10 a day on Yorkie bars . With food as his only source of comfort, he doubled in weight from 30 to 65 stone in just three years and became housebound. 'That’s how I put all this weight on. I was very close to my mum,' he said speaking of his mother. 'She was fantastic, and I still haven’t got over it.' Now his days normally begin with a fry-up breakfast of four sausages, five fried eggs, a pan-full of mushrooms and fried bread. Lunch can be a bowlful of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate and dinner a takeaway. Since he is unable to leave the house Mr Thompson relies on online shopping deliveries and takeaways. His carers prepare meals with the ingredients he has bought. 'I order takeaways five nights a week, usually spending between £10 and £25 on Chinese, curries, pizza or fish and chips,' he said. 'My carers cook my food during he day and it's always microwaved meals - my favourite is chicken curry.' Alongside takeaways Mr Thompson spends £10 a day on chocolate, typically Yorkie bars.

"A child victim who was beaten and sexually abused for years by their father has defended their mother and the man's second wife for their alleged roles in the sickening pedophile ring where incest and bestiality was discovered. Christopher Sena, 47, his wife Deborah Sena, 50, and ex-wife Terrie Sena have been accused of abusing at least eight children over 13 years in their Las Vegas trailer-park home. The three allegedly took part in underage, incestuous video-taped sex attacks and were arrested last year. Terrie Sena, 43, agreed to a plea deal in January with Clark County prosecutors on one count of sexual assault that could put her behind bars for 10 years to life. Scroll down for video . Terrie Sena, 43, (pictured left) agreed to a plea deal for taking part in incestuous video-taped sex attacks with her ex-husband and his second wife, Deborah (right). A former child victim of the pedophile ring has defended the two women . Deborah Sena was offered the same deal, but her attorney said she was a victim and her husband made her take part. Her defense attorney, Kristina Wildeveld, told the Review-Journal: 'She was coerced, threatened, blackmailed, beaten, by Chris Sena. 'I'm very uncomfortable with a victim of domestic violence signing up for 10 to life in prison for something that she never was an active participant in.' The statement was seconded by a victim of the sickening sexual abuse, who is now an adult. In a letter to the Las Vegas Review-Journal this week, the victim said the mothers should not face jail because they were also subjected to years of torture and sexual abuse. The victim said the women, like the child victims, lived in constant fear and were monitored 24/7 by Sena, under threats of violence. Christopher Sena has been accused of sexually abusing his children and filming them in sickening acts for more than ten years . The letter read: 'Christopher would ask them if (Deborah or Terrie Sena) would like to take the punishment instead of us. 'And they would take those beatings for us.' The victim also added in the letter: 'Our father is in jail, where he belongs. 'And the absence of our mothers continues to victimize us kids.' Christopher Sena was arrested in September as part of a SWAT team operation and recording equipment seized from the home. Authorities allegedly found footage of Deborah Sena, who left her husband last August and reported the abuse, involved in sexual acts with the family dog. She claimed her husband told her she would do what he wanted if she loved him. One of the seized recordings also allegedly shows two children having sex with the family dog,The Daily Beast reported. Sena faces 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse. Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison. The 47-year-old is due in court for a preliminary hearing in April. The women, who were arrested on December 11, together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor

"His primary job is to keep opposition strikers at bay, but that hasn't stopped John Terry from showing them the art of finishing too. The Chelsea captain scored his side's second goal in their 3-1 win away at Leicester on Wednesday night - as the Blues close in on their fourth Premier League title. The 34-year-old's close-range effort took his tally for the season to seven in all competitions - making him the club's joint third-highest goalscorer. John Terry was on hand to prod home from close range against Leicester on Wednesday night . Terry's strike at the King Power Stadium was his seventh goal in all competitions for Chelsea this season . Terry sits alongside strikers Loic Remy and Didier Drogba with seven goals apiece as well as attacking midfielder Oscar. Only star striker Diego Costa (20 goals) and PFA Player of the Year Eden Hazard (18) have more for Jose Mourinho's side this campaign. The centre back's ability to score is a skill that compares him favourably to the firepower among other teams in and around the top seven of the table. At Manchester City, former Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard also has seven goals in all competitions this season - but Terry has fared better than forwards Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic who have only found the back of the net six and five times respectively. On the other side of Manchester, much has been made of the malaise of on loan United striker Radamel Falcao. The 29-year-old has endured a tough season in England and this has been reflected by his poor tally of four goals in all competitions. Terry's goal return is better than Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko - who has six goals for the season . Radamel Falcao has endured a difficult season on loan at Manchester United - scoring only four goals . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has scored only one more goal than Terry this season . Liverpool forward Mario Balotelli (left) and Tottenham's Roberto Soldado have both struggled in front of goal . Danny Welbeck, who left United for Arsenal last summer, hasn't fared much better too - having scored eight goals in all competitions for the Gunners. North London rivals Tottenham have relied heavily upon on the goals of Harry Kane and without his productivity Mauricio Pochettino would have had to call upon four-goal man Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor who has only scored twice. Liverpool's struggle for goals has been highlighted by the fact that Raheem Sterling has been deployed in attack by manager Brendan Rodgers this season. First-choice forward Daniel Sturridge has scored only five goals in a campaign which has been beset by injuries. Coupled with that, summer signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have failed to replace the void left by Luis Suarez - with the pair having scored four and three goals apiece. Terry's impressive goal return is even impressive when you look at the figures of Lambert's former club Southampton, where Saints forward Graziano Pelle (15) is their only player to have scored more than

"An educational centre at Cambridge University nearly lost two 'irreplaceable' artefacts after they were taken by an oblivious tourist who thought they were souvenirs. The Japanese artefacts – a wooden plaque and replica school textbook – went missing from the Kaetsu Educational and Cultural Centre last Saturday as it hosted a Japan Day celebration. The replicas were loaned to the university from a museum in Japan, marking the first time they had ever been taken out of the country. Punt boats carry tourists on the river Cam past King's College at Cambridge University . Staff launched a search after they noticed the precious objects were missing. They eventually found the tourist who had mistaken the artefacts for souvenirs and returned them with an apology. University officials said the textbook is a replica of those used in Japanese schools during World War II. During the war residents of the island of Okinawa – a key battleground for Japanese and American forces – were forced to speak the Japanese language the rest of the country used, rather than their own dialect, for the purposes of unification. The Japanese artefacts were taken by a tourist during a Japan Day celebration at Cambridge University . As punishment, those who spoke their native tongue were forced to wear the wooden plaque around their neck. The artefacts are now being returned to the Peace Memorial Museum in Okinawa. Peter Roberts-Taira, the education centre's director, said he was relieved when he found out that the artefacts had been recovered. He said: ‘It's the first time these items have ever been out of Japan, so the museums themselves were taking a risk. University officials said they located the tourist and the artefacts were returned with an apology (file photo) ‘It was Saturday, right at the very end of the day when everyone was packing away that we realised they had gone. ‘One was a wooden plaque with some Japanese on it, the other was a maths book which children had in their classrooms.’ He added: ‘You wouldn't know they were valuable to look at, so maybe somebody just though they could take them. ‘The message went out wider to people who asked their friends, and apparently they discovered a friend of a friend had thought those things were possible to take away as souvenirs. ‘They are irreplaceable, if they are gone, they are gone forever. It's very, very special to have them at all.'

"The bi-racial granddaughter of a Nazi concentration camp leader has revealed the horrifying moment she discovered the truth about her ancestry after she was given up for adoption. Jennifer Teege was 38 when she came across a book in a Hamburg library written by her mother - a name she recognized - and learned that she was the granddaughter of SS Commander Amon Goeth, who was portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in the 1993 Oscar-winning movie 'Schindler's List'. 'It really turned my world upside down,' said Teege, now 44. She has now penned a book - due out next month - about the life-changing discovery and how her adoptive parents and therapist helped her find peace with who she was. Scroll down for video . Learning the truth: Jennifer Teege, pictured, has written a book that comes out this month about her soul-searching experience after she found out her grandfather led a concentration camp in Nazi Germany . Ancestor: When she was 38, she learned that her grandfather was SS Commander Amon Goeth (pictured left), who was portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in the 1993 Oscar-winning movie 'Schindler's List' (right) 'A Nazi gene doesn't exist,' she told People magazine. 'We can decide for ourselves who and what we want to be.' Teege was the result of a brief relationship between her German mother and Nigerian father; by the time she was born, her mother was in another relationship and she was given up for adoption. By the age of seven, she had been taken in to a foster family but she reconnected with her mother, Monika Hertwig, when she was 20. Her mother told her nothing of her ancestry. By nearly two decades later, she came across her mother's book, 'I Have To Love My Father, Don't I? The Life Story of Monika Goeth' and recognized the author as her mother. 'The moment I had that book in my hand, I knew it would give me so many answers,' she told People. She learned that her grandfather had ran a concentration camp in Plaszow, Poland in World War II. Family: Teege, who was adopted, made the discovery when she found a book about her biological mother, Monika Hertwig (pictured), in a library. She had had contact with her mother, who never told her the truth . Ancestors: Teege's mother Monika is pictured right in the 1940s with her own mother Ruth Irene Kalder, who had an affair with Goeth while working as a secretary in his factory . Goeth was known for shooting Jewish inmates for sport at the concentration camp and for training his large dogs to attack them, and was a central character in the film 'Schinder's List'. Compelling: Jennifer Teege has penned a book about the discovery, due out next month . The German industrialist Oskar Schindler saved more than 1,200 Jews by bribing Goeth and other Nazis to have them work in his factories rather than be sent for extermination in death camps.

"Atlanta (CNN)A report on lab safety at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put together by a committee of external experts calls the agency's commitment to safety ""inconsistent and insufficient."" The report, which was completed in January but posted on the agency's website this week, also says ""laboratory safety training is inadequate."" The report was put together by an external group of 11 experts in biosafety, laboratory science and research. In the report, they say they are ""very concerned that the CDC is on the way to losing credibility."" The agency created the advisory group to improve lab safety in July in the wake of two mishaps and other issues that were uncovered through procedural reviews. One incident occurred in June when dozens of employees in a bioterrorism lab working with the deadly anthrax virus, were at risk because of a failure to properly follow sterilization techniques. The head of that lab resigned after the incident. This followed a May incident in which avian influenza samples, thought to not be dangerous, were unintentionally mixed with the deadly H5N1 influenza virus and then shipped to a USDA lab. Then in December, with the advisory group already working to reduce lab safety risks and improve the culture of safety, employees in the Ebola lab were potentially exposed to that virus when a technician mistakenly transported the wrong specimens from a high-level lab to a lower-level lab. Internal investigations were done after each incident, and various changes were recommended such as cameras being added to some labs and certificates being required to transfer samples from some labs, following the Ebola incident. The four-page report summarizes the groups findings and offers recommendations following visits to CDC labs, meetings with CDC staff and a survey about the laboratory safety culture at CDC. The report recommends all CDC labs go through an external review and accreditation process. They suggest the College of American Pathologists for clinical labs and the American Biological Safety Association for research labs. To that point, the committee says in the report, ""The CDC must not see itself as special. The internal controls and rules that the rest of the world works under also apply to CDC."" Other recommendations include: . -- Funding for lab safety programs and standardized training. -- Implementing risk assessments. -- Establishing a system of responsible science and accountability. -- Rewarding researchers who run safe labs. -- Hiring a director to oversee lab safety. In response to the recommendations, CDC Chief Operating Officer Sherri Berger said in a statement, ""It's critical that we continue to solicit feedback on how we can improve our operations, especially functions as critical as lab safety. We brought this group of external experts together over the summer to assist us with identifying and implementing solutions, of which many are already underway.""

"(CNN)Famed cosmologist Stephen Hawking has proved his comedy chops on shows like ""The Big Bang Theory,"" and now he's trying his hand at musicals. Hawking has partnered with the silly lads of Monty Python to recreate the signature ""Galaxy Song"" from their 1983 film ""The Meaning of Life."" The collabo is in honor of Saturday's Record Store Day, when the 7-inch single will be available for sale. The accompanying video is guaranteed to be the most awesome thing you see today. In it, fellow scientist Brian Cox rails against the inaccuracies in ""Galaxy Song"" when a fed-up Hawking, who has ALS, zooms up in his wheelchair and knocks over Cox. Hawking continues singing the song in his signature computerized voice. Hawking then launches into the stratosphere for a trippy ride and lesson on the cosmos. The scene is derived from a filmed bit that Monty Python uses during its live shows. 40 years of 'Holy Grail': The best of Monty Python . ""Galaxy Song"" song was written by Python member Eric Idle, along with John Du Prez, and is ""an intricate and informative lecture on the enor-mity of the Universe fashioned into a bewitching and, above all, highly amusing pop song,"" according to the comedy troupe's site. Hawking's version is available for download. It's not Hawking's first music gig; he's also featured on the Pink Floyd song ""Talkin' Hawkin.'"" The original version of ""Galaxy Song"" is below.

"(CNN)The man suspected of killing a deputy U.S. marshal at a motel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has died, Brittany Stewart in the East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office said Wednesday. The cause of death is pending autopsy, she said. Jamie Croom, 31, was wounded in a shootout with Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells. It can be one of the most dangerous tasks for a law enforcement officer: serving an arrest warrant to a fugitive murder suspect. When Wells tried to do that Tuesday, he lost his life. ""Wells was part of a team executing arrest warrants on a fugitive wanted for double homicide in Baton Rouge,"" the U.S. Marshals Service said in a news release. ""The team engaged in gunfire with the fugitive and Wells was shot. He was immediately transported to Lane Regional Medical Center in Zachary, Louisiana, where he died."" Wells, 28, was trying to arrest Croom, who is suspected in the deaths of a brother and sister in New Roads, Louisiana, CNN affiliate WAFB said. ""Our deputies and law enforcement partners face untold dangers every day in the pursuit of justice in cities nationwide,"" said U.S. Marshals Service Director Stacia A. Hylton said in a news release. ""The fugitive who killed Deputy Wells was extremely dangerous, wanted for double homicide and intentionally evaded justice. ... When a public servant dies in the line of duty, it is an immeasurable tragedy felt by all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Deputy Wells' family, friends and colleagues."" Officials would not elaborate on exactly what happened, but The Advocate newspaper in Baton Rouge said there was a shootout. Authorities said Croom shot and killed Wells at a Baton Rouge motel. Wells, 28, was based in Mississippi but was on temporary assignment in the Baton Rouge area, the Sun Herald newspaper said. He was married and came from a law enforcement family. Despite the risks, Wells loved his job. ""It was his passion,"" longtime friend Alex McGee told the paper. ""I tipped my hat to him because he knew the dangers and wanted to do the job anyway."" Croom, the suspect, was taken to a hospital after he was wounded, WAFB said. He was wanted in the shooting deaths of the two siblings in February and was also on probation for firearms charges. That double homicide stemmed from a feud over a loan made to one of the victim's relatives as well as an alleged break-in at the suspect's grandmother's house, Croom's older sister Latonia Croom Duncan told CNN. Duncan said the family reported threats and a shooting at her grandmother's house to police, but said there was never any follow-up. She said her brother called her the night of the homicides, which took place at a nightclub. ""He called me and said he loved me and that he'd be gone,"" Duncan said. ""He said he wasn't going back to jail. Before he'd go back to jail, he said, he'd rather be dead."" CNN's Devon M. Sayers, John Newsome, Sam Stringer and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.

"If Kim Kardashian has proven anything, it's that big bums are big business. Kim, who was officially crowned 'world's best bottom', sparked a new trend for 'bacials' - that's bottom facials - and caused a 45 per cent increase in bottom enhancing procedures over the last 12 months. And now, one high street store have created a pair of bottom-boosting jeans that promise to give you a derriere to rival the reality TV star. Debenhams has unveiled a £45 pair of bottom-boosting jeans designed by Jasper Conran. MailOnline's Hanna Flint pitted the enhancing jeans, right, against her regular jeans, left . Debenhams has jumped on the derriere enhancing bandwagon by giving customers the chance to enhance that all-important asset with a pair of £45 jeans. The new denims, designed by Jasper Conran, can add up to two extra inches to your derriere and have proved an instant success for the high-street chain. According to the store, the Shape Enhancing Jeans are said to be flying off the shelves, purchased by women looking for a more shapely figure. FEMAIL put the jeans to the test to see if they really can give you a pert posterior a la Kim or whether it's all just a clever gimmick. The new denims, right, can add up to two extra inches to your derriere compared to normal jeans, left, as modelled by 24-year-old Jenny Kershaw . Lucy Herring, 28, tested out her day-to-day jeans, left, against the bottom-boosting pair, right, which have heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve . The secret to the new jeans' success? A clever combination of cheek-enhancing cut, expert tailoring, and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve, promising to turn a shapeless bottom into rear of the year. Control panels at the front also claim to flatten the tummy to emphasise the effect, while the position of the darts in the denim promise to give a flattering hourglass effect. Debenhams also say the jeans give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear. Speaking about the jeans, a spokesperson for Debenhams said: 'Pictures of curvy famous women, from Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj, to Pippa Middleton and Carol Vorderman, have helped women with prominent rears realise they have a gorgeous fashionable asset to emphasise, rather than minimise. 'Of course it is a little more difficult for women with a slimmer, straight up and down silhouette. The only solution used to be an expensive gym membership and weeks of working out, but now buying a pair of shaping jeans can offer a wonderful, instant booty boost.' The jeans promise to give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear, which Bianca London, 25, tested out (left: regular jeans, right: bottom-boosting jeans) According to the store, the Shape Enhancing Jeans boost bottoms thanks to a clever combination of cheek-enhancing cut, expert tailoring, and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve .

"Comedian John Oliver couldn’t resist ridiculing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz over the introduction last week of his controversial ‘Race Together’ initiative. Schultz and the coffee chain have faced an avalanche of bad publicity and public derision over a well-intentioned initiative for its baristas to strike up a conversation about race relations in the U.S. with customers. ‘I think it’s pretty clear that no one has said “no” to this guy in 25 years,’ said Oliver as he could hardly contain his glee at the comedic material the announcement has created. Comedian John Oliver couldn’t resist ridiculing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Sunday over the introduction last week of his controversial ‘Race Together’ initiative . Speaking on his HBO show on Sunday, the British comedian said a conversation about race is ‘clearly important but there is a time and a place’ ‘But it is not the length of time it takes to whip up a tiramisu frappuccino,’ he joked. The campaign, announced on Tuesday, has received criticism that the company was using racial tensions to boost its bottom line, as it came in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. Others questioned how Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks. 'Still let's give Howard Schultz credit for starting a conversation across the racial divide with a white billionaire pitching an idea and any number of African American customers telling him how stupid it was,' said Oliver. One user tweeted: 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train.' ‘Hey how’s that conversation on race going Starbucks? Lots of fun right? What if this could be every morning?’ joked Oliver on his HBO show on Sunday . Another added: '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life 'white man's burden' crisis.' ‘Hey how’s that conversation on race going Starbucks? Lots of fun right? What if this could be every morning?’ joked Oliver. 'Nice try Starbucks. Now you can go back to what you do best – burning coffee and glaring at us for using your bathroom without buying anything.' 'Just stay in your lane!' In the face of the backlash, Starbucks announced over the weekend that baristas will no longer be encouraged to write 'Race Together' on customers' cups. The initiative ended on Sunday, but spokesperson Jim Olson denied that the phase out was a reaction to the push back the chain has received. 'Nothing is changing,' he said. 'It's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned.' In a statement on Sunday, Schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was 'just the catalyst' for a larger conversation . Ridiculed: After the campaign was announced, Twitter users slammed the idea as naive . In a statement on Sunday, Schultz acknowledged the naysayers and skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach. 'While there has been criticism of the initiative - and I know

"Our almost constant use of mobile phones and the decline of working class jobs are contributing to the erosion of the age-old whistle according to new research. Once heard constantly on the streets, in songs, on the stage and in the workplace it has nearly disappeared. Whistling aficionados are in agreement, no one is whistling while they work – or anywhere else for that matter. All children used to be told to whistle while they work by the classic Disney animation Snow White. However the rise of the mobile phone and music on the ipod means young people are less likely to whistle now. Cultural historian at Syracuse University, London, Chris Cook, told the Sunday Times that whistling has all but disappeared over the last few decades. A YouGov poll commissioned by the newspaper confirmed the trend illustrating that 70 percent of people were in agreement that they hear fewer people whistling compared with 20 or 30 years ago. Half of those asked said they believed the decline was a result of the demise of working class culture, while a third said they were listening to ipods and personal music players instead of whistling. Co-Author of 'A Brief History of Whistling' John Lucas said the sound of miners on their way to the pits or workers to and from the factories used to be common. He explained there were even whistling choirs on the buses on the way to work. In the 70s and 80s whistling was still popular in many pop songs, John Lennon's Jealous Guy, later covered by Bryan Ferry's Roxy Music in 1981 were well-liked whistling tunes . Paul Simon'a 1972 hit Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard is also well-known for its use of whistling . Monty Python's Always Look On the Bright Side of Life from the 1979 film the Life of Brian is one of the few tunes you might hear whistled . Lucas said other jobs also normally associated with whistling were gone. These included errand delivery boys, and the coalman. Where the jobs do exist, whistling does not appear to be appreciated. Kevin Gifford, a milkman from Leicestershire was handed a warning in 2013 after residents on his route complained that his whistling disturbed them. The slow fizzle of whistling's popularity has also been linked to the decline of variety shows. In the past whistlers could be incredibly popular. Ronnie Rondale from Islington, London was so successful that he became a best-selling artist with Columbia records and toured the world. However, the era of master whistlers is still not completely dead and Britain can still boast at least one. Seventy-year-old Sheila Harrod from Loughborough won the 1995 international whistling championship in Berlin and still performs 1940s-style variety shows at home and abroad. Mrs. Harrod explained that she began honing her whistling skills at the age of 13 but complained that now young people don't seem much interested in it. All of her audiences are at least over 40. In the 70s and 80s whistling was still popular in many pop songs, as Paul

"It's been three weeks since Dan Osborne was heard threatening to stab his ex-girlfriend - and the mother of his one-year-old son Teddy - Megan Tomlin in an audio recording. But a second audio, handed over by Megan, 23, this week and released by The Sun On Sunday, hears the 23-year-old TOWIE star make another expletive-laden rant, threatening to end her life. Dan, who was arrested but released by Essex Police without charge after the last incident, also refers to his second child Ella, born last month with Jacqueline Jossa, as a 'mistake.' Scroll down for video . Recorded: A second audio recording has been released which hears TOWIE star Dan Osborne threatening his ex-girlfriend, and the mother of his child Teddy, during an expletive rant . Dan and Megan split in April 2013, shortly after the birth of Teddy, and the reality TV star then started dating EastEnders actress Jacqueline before announcing they were pregnant in August 2014. Now though, an audio-taped recording - heard by MailOnline and allegedly secretly taken by Megan last November at her home in front of their young son - sees Dan refer to her as his 'property' and threaten her if she moves on with another man. He is heard saying: 'I swear on this boy’s life I will end your f****** life if you shag another man. Never in your f****** life are you going to be with another man. I can swear on my son’s life.' Split: Dan Osborne and ex-girlfriend Megan Tomlin split in Aprul 2013 and have a one-year-old son together Teddy . 'Shut your f****** mouth you f****** c***. If you go near another man I promise you I will stab you in the f****** throat.' Dan made similar threats of physical violence in the first tape released earlier this month but in this latest release Megan can be heard exclaiming, 'Ow, get off me!' and tells Dan to stop 'hitting' her until she seems distressed and in tears. There is no proof that Dan actually hits Megan in the recording. After asking him to leave her house, he admits, 'Yes I am horrible when you go on about other men' telling her that as long as they have a son together, Megan is his 'property' Bouncing back: Following the release of the first audio recording, in which Dan was heard denying he was dating current girlfriend and the mother of his second child Jacqueline Jossa, Dan is now back in his relationship and expected back on TOWIE . Throwback: Megan and Dan are now the parents of Teddy, who is one year old . Dan can be heard telling Megan that she can't get a new boyfriend even though he's made another girl pregnant because that was a 'mistake' and he didn't 'mean' to get 22-year-old Jacqueline pregnant. Megan tells him that it's laughable because having a child doesn't get more permanent but he says things would be different if he 'actually wanted a family with [Jacqueline]' or if he was going to 'propose' to her. 'I don't care.

"A pledge to lift everyone except millionaires out of inheritance tax is to be revived by the Conservatives in their general election manifesto. Official forecasts suggest the number of families paying death duties will double over the next five years unless the current threshold of £325,000 is raised. Leaked Government documents suggest that the majority of estates currently liable would be lifted out of tax under plans drawn up for the Tories. The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Lib Dems . The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives proposed raising the threshold to £1million before the 2010 election, prompting the Labour government to allow married couples effectively to combine their allowances to £650,000. The Chancellor's plan to raise it further was killed off by the coalition with the Lib Dems, who insisted that raising the personal income tax allowance should take priority. David Cameron believes families who do not feel 'in any way mega-rich' are being dragged into the tax bracket, according to Government sources. One option is to create a new tax free band worth £175,000 per person on a family home, that could be transferred between married couples, making it worth a maximum of £350,000. The leaked documents show that by adding the existing maximum combined allowance for couples of £650,000 to the new maximum relief of £350,000, properties up to £1million would escape inheritance tax. The Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable (pictured) said the Tory plan was 'very cynical' The paper, written by officials for the Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke, notes the scheme will be 'very popular with the public'. 'It will allow you to say you are exempting those with modest homes from inheritance tax (with up to £1million of assets) exempted in certain circumstances,' the paper states. 'This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house, particularly in London and the South East, paying inheritance tax.' It estimates that by 2019-20, around 20,000 fewer estates a year would be liable for any inheritance tax. Critics of the duty say that money bequeathed at death has already been taxed, so should not face further charges. They also point out that the super-rich often employ accountants to devise trusts and exemptions to reduce their liability. The Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Tory plan was 'very cynical'. 'If taxes can be cut – and it's very difficult within the present budget constraint – we've got to start at the bottom with people on low pay, not at the top,' he said. A revival of the inheritance tax pledge would be another pitch to the 'grey vote' that could prove crucial in May's election. The policy was credited with a surge in support for the Conservatives in 2007, which helped scare Gordon Brown into abandoning plans for a snap election. Experts pointed out that the Treasury has suggested the inheritance

"(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the ""severe outbreak,"" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people ""who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,"" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there ""is not a lot to do."" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as ""a community activity,"" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for

"It may be another 149 days until England begin their World Cup campaign against Fiji at Twickenham, but England assistant coach Andy Farrell can already feel the excitement building across the country. Stuart Lancaster’s side will take on the South Sea Islanders in the World Cup curtain-raiser on September 18 at England HQ in a tournament that will encompass 48 matches spread across 44 days of action. ‘Rugby is going to be the sport of the year with the World Cup coming up,’ said Farrell. Andy Farrell says rugby union is going to be the sport of the year with the World Cup coming up in England . ‘It's as though the tournament is going to start in a few weeks’ time. If it’s already like it is now, I think we'll never have seen anything like it come World Cup time. The important thing on the back of that is obviously seizing the opportunity for the legacy after it. ‘I've absolutely no doubt that this is going to be the biggest World Cup ever. You go to places like Gloucester or Exeter; you see the buzz around the place because they know it's coming. It's going to be fantastic.’ England came within six points of claiming the RBS 6 Nations following their pulsating 55-35 victory against France on the final day of the championship – as Ireland secured a second successive title on points difference. It was the fourth consecutive time that England had finished second in the championship, but Farrell saw plenty of positives with international rookies like Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson and George Ford impressing throughout while established campaigners such as Ben Youngs and Billy Vunipola looked rejuvenated. ‘Coming into the World Cup, we're in a great place,’ Farrell explained. ‘There were a few injuries before the Six Nations and people got their opportunity. A lot of people took those opportunities. We're fortunate now that when we pick a 31-man squad; all these guys will have had some experience at international level. ‘Not just experience, but in pressure situations like the French game for example. We’re certainly going to have a squad full of people that can certainly cope in this environment.’ The England assistant coach says England are in great shape ahead of the tournament this summer . England will begin their preparations for the tournament with a two-week training camp at Pennyhill Park in early July. The squad will then embark on a trip to Colorado in Texas for a fortnight of high-intensity training at high-altitude before returning for three warm-up games against France (twice) and Ireland prior to the tournament. England must name a 31-man World Cup squad by August 31 and Farrell admits that some tough selection calls lay ahead. ‘The first train-on squad, we could pick up to 50 players. There'll be good players disappointed that they've not got into that squad! ‘Imagine taking it down to 31 - there's going to be a lot of players, good players, missing out on what is dream playing in a home World Cup so it's a

"When it comes to criss-crossing the globe by plane, it seems jet lag is the least of our worries. Whether you're suffering from dehydration due to low cabin humidity or suffering from pain in your ear canal during takeoff and landing, everything from oxygen deprivation to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell in the air. Here are some of the scariest health effects of flying... and some suggestions to prevent and combat them. Everything from dehydration to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell while in the air . Dehydration . While bodies are most comfortable at around 50 percent humidity, an aeroplane's cabin humidity can be as low as 10 per cent. That is drier than being in a desert. Naturally, this extreme dryness will only lead to only one inevitable conclusion: a very dehydrated traveller. According to NHS, the symptoms of dehydration include 'dizziness or light-headedness, headache, tiredness, dry mouth, lips and eyes, and the passing of small amounts of urine infrequently.' Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina and dry sinuses, nostrils and throat that make you far more prone to infection. Combat all of this by drinking plenty of water and keeping away from beverages with diuretic properties, like alcohol or coffee. Low humidity in cabin air means that passengers should keep diuretic beverages, like alcohol, to a minimum . Ear pain . Ever wondered exactly why you feel pain in your ears during takeoff and landing? It turns out that the uncomfortable feeling a product of the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure to build up within the ear canal. But it's only when this pressure cannot be released, such as due to blockage from a cold, for example, that the passenger will really be made aware of the change. Luckily, alleviating the pressure in most cases is relatively easy - simply by swallowing, chewing or yawning. Additionally, the motion sickness that you may feel in the pit of your stomach actually also starts in your inner ears, when your balance is thrown off by something like turbulence. Ear pain during take off and landing is due to the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure . In this instance, the best bet for preventing nausea is to book a seat over the wings, which is the steadiest part of the plane. And the final ear-related concern to contend with on board has to do with hearing. Whether watching a movie or listening to your iPod, the sounds you're blasting to block out engine noise and passenger chatter are probably wreaking a bit of havoc, since it's a different listening environment than you're used to with different levels of ambient noise to tune out. Although your hearing won't suffer any permanent damage after a plane ride or two, frequent fliers should take note of the decibel difference to avoid any sort of long-term effects. Lower levels of oxygen in the plane's pressurised air can cause light-headedness and shallow breathing . Oxygen deprivation . It may be a

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers accepts Champions League football is unlikely to return to Anfield next season, but insisted once again that contract rebel Raheem Sterling will do. This has been an uncomfortable week on Merseyside after the England forward's ill-advised interview only heightened speculation over his future. Sterling told the BBC that he turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal but insisted he was not a 'money-grabbing 20-year-old', while also admitting that links to Saturday's opponents Arsenal were 'quite flattering'. Raheem Sterling will still be a Liverpool player next season, insists Reds boss Brendan Rodgers . Sterling (left) started Liverpool's 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday despite going public over his club contract . Rodgers spoke to the forward about the week's events yet still started him at the Emirates Stadium, where the Gunners all but ended Liverpool's hopes of a top-four finish with a comfortable 4-1 win. 'The reaction and commitment of the players has been first class since (the defeat to Crystal Palace in November),' Rodgers said. 'Really, up until the Manchester United game we were the form team and playing very, very well. 'But we have been dealt two big blows in these last two games, we haven't performed how we would like and that has ultimately cost us in terms of the result. 'I very much doubt we will be in the top four now come the end of the season. There's too much ground to make up - that's the realistic view from me. 'Now, we must really focus on the FA Cup and that has got to be very, very important for us.' The 20-year-old (right) has turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal and put off talks until the summer . Liverpool take on Blackburn in a replay of their FA Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, when talk about Sterling will no doubt still be dominating the headlines. Rodgers is only interested on what is happening with the forward on the field, though, and wants another impressive performance from the England international at Ewood Park. 'There was no change in him,' he said of Sterling. 'I thought he was excellent today, our best player. 'He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, won the penalty and was very direct and strong, so I thought he was excellent today.' Rodgers was peppered with questions about Sterling in the post-match press conference, during which he said 'a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him'. Sterling (top) did win the visitors' penalty after he was fouled by Bellering (bottom) in the second half . The Liverpool manager was coy when asked about outside influences destabilising both club and player, but was forthright when it came to the forward's future. 'At 20 years of age - and just turned 20 in December - there is still a long way for him to go,' said Rodgers, who confirmed Mario Balotelli deemed himself unfit to travel after receiving a knock in training. 'He has got a lot of potential. I believe that potential he can really develop over

Her blog told of her life as a struggling graduate in London and working as call girl to fund her studies - and included her former lover Owen Morris, known only as 'The Boy'.

Writing on blog Sexonomics at the time, she said: 'I have no choice but to defend this. But am happy to do so even though it will almost certainly mean losing everything I have even when I win.'

"Tim Farron, pictured, has vowed to bring the Lib Dem party 'back from the dead' Embattled Nick Clegg faced a dramatic leadership challenge last night after a top Lib Dem MP vowed to bring the party ‘back from the dead’. Former Lib Dem President Tim Farron savaged Deputy Prime Minister Clegg’s U-turn on university tuition fees and said the party had been ‘tarnished’ by the Coalition with David Cameron. Farron, a bitter Lib Dem foe of Clegg, said the party needed a tough new leader like ex-marine Paddy Ashdown who rescued it from a similar crisis in the 1980s. He said he had the ‘vision and never say die’ spirit needed to repair the slump in Lib Dem fortunes under Clegg. Left-winger Farron, hot favourite to succeed Clegg if, as expected, the Lib Dems flop in the Election, threw down the gauntlet in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. Clegg’s panicking allies have launched a ‘stop Farron’ campaign in a last-ditch attempt to stop him taking over after the Election. But speaking ahead of the party’s spring conference in Liverpool this weekend, Farron made it clear he is determined to replace Clegg. He brushed aside claims by the Clegg camp that he is a ‘sanctimonious, God-bothering, treacherous little s***’, compared Clegg’s leadership to the Lib Dems’ ‘near death’ in the 1980s and said voters would never forgive him for his tuition fees somersault. For a committed Christian, it is surprising how much hatred Farron generates among fellow top Lib Dems. There is no love lost between Farron and his main leadership rival, Minister and Clegg ally Norman Lamb. Clegg, Lamb and co swallowed their Lib Dem pride and principles, at least on occasion, for ministerial jobs and limos in the Coalition.Meanwhile, Farron, refused a Government post by Clegg, could grandstand from the sidelines, voting against the bedroom tax and tuition fees. Farron’s supporters in the Lib Dem sandal-wearing brigade say he is ‘untainted’ and see ‘Saint Tim’ as a saviour. He became a Christian at 18, when marooned in a house in rainy Singapore on a trip with his mum. ‘There was nothing to blinkin’ read and I read this weird-looking book on God. It was life-changing,’ he explains. Farron’s conversation is peppered with ‘blinkins’ and ‘bloomins’, adding to a boyish, Tintin cartoon air of wide-eyed enthusiasm. The book he stumbled on said the Bible was true. And from that moment, Tim believed every word. Literally. He thinks God knows everything. ‘Every hair on your head is numbered,’ he says, without blinking. God knows every hair on his head? ‘Yeah.’ Farron believes that Nick Clegg, pictured, blew the trust of the voters by his u-turn on tuition fees . Mr Farron, pictured, said neither of the two main parties should assume the Lib Dems will prop them up . He scoffs at the idea of a ‘half-baked distant God – either he created every bloomin’ atom in the entire universe or he didn’t’. He derides those who believe in ‘some kind of part-time, low-wattage God’.Similarly, he believes Heaven and Hell really

"A women's rights group has slammed a popular eatery for their latest advertising campaign which they claim objectifies women's bodies to sell beer. The Lowenbrau Keller, in Sydney's The Rocks, has released a social media and bus campaign featuring the slogan 'Wunderbra' underneath a photograph of a woman in a low-cut lederhosen holding a tray of beer steins. The same campaign also features an image of two women in a similar state of dress with the caption 'Make Mein A Dubbel', sparking outrage from Collective Shout, who claim the advertisements reinforces sexual objectification. Scroll down for video . Campaign group Collective Shout has slammed Sydney restaurant Lowenbrau Keller for an advertising campaign they claim sexually objectifies women . The Lowenbrau Keller campaign is being used on both social media and public transport platforms . 'Through this advertising Lowenbrau reinforces sexist attitudes and invites patrons to view female staff as sexual objects, exposing them to sexual harassment,' Melinda Liszewski, spokesperson for grassroots campaign movement Collective Shout, told Daily Mail Australia. '[The company's slogan] “Live it Large” and “Wunderbra” sends the message to an audience of all ages that women are to be valued for their body parts,' Ms Liszewski said. Ms Liszewski said that the 'Make Mein A Dubbel' advertisement also suggests that the two women shown are 'part of the menu'. Dan Hopkirk, Marketing Director for Urban Purveyor Groups who owns the Lowenbrau Keller, said that the advertisements were meant as 'fun play-on words' that people would be familiar with. '[The campaign was] designed as a portrayal of the typical Bavarian cultural experience enjoyed by millions during Oktoberfest in Munich every year, synonymous with this venue,' Mr Hopkirk said. 'The advertising slogans coupled with the imagery that has been used across the campaign, are popular anglicised German phrases which are fun play-on words,' he said. 'The Löwenbräu Keller campaign aims to embody the traditions of Oktoberfest which is about a celebratory occasion and enjoyable time spent with friends.' Ms Liszewski said that the Lowenbrau Keller, along with other establishments which the Urban Purveyor Group owns, including the Bavarian Bier Cafe, has a history of creating sexist and objectifying advertisements. 'A number of Lowenbrau advertisements make a direct comparison between the serving size of food and beverages and the size of women’s breasts,' she said. Ms Liszewski said that the advertisement also suggests that the two women shown are 'part of the menu' This images was tweeted from the restaurant's official Twitter account and posted to their Facebook page with the caption 'Is anybody suddenly thirsty?' The advertisements have garnered criticism from social media users who expressed their outrage over the allegedly objectifying images . 'This is explicitly spelt out via an ad on social media “Bigger is better - don’t you agree? We’ve got big biers, big meals and big…fun. #beer” and reinforced by outdoor advertisements.' The image, which shows a woman's chest next to steins of beer, was tweeted from the restaurant's official Twitter account, and was also posted to their Facebook page with the caption 'Is anyone else suddenly thirsty

"A northeast Ohio bridal store linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson has put its building up for sale after announcing plans to close. Miss Vinson, 30, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio in October. The store temporarily closed and was cleaned before reopening, but its owner, Anna Younker, said there was a lingering 'stigma' and business failed to bounce back. On Friday she announced on the shop's Facebook page that the bank has now cut off the business credit line, forcing her to sell the building for $338,000. Negative press: Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio, (above) which was linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson, is now up for sale after business failed to bounce back . Chain of events: Miss Vinson, 30, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas (pictured), was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting the shop in October . The store, located at 1220 E. Tallmadge Ave., is listed with Cutler Real Estate. Particulars describe it as a 'great 4,000 sq ft brick retail building, built in 1996 with eye-catching curb appeal. 'The space would be ideal for beauty shop, message facility, auto parts store, doctors/dentist office, day-care center or veterinarian with plenty of parking.' Younker, who has been in business for 30 years, said her shop became known as the 'Ebola store' after news of Vinson's visit hit the press. She claims that the temporary closure and canceled orders cost the store at least $100,000. The loss wasn't covered by her insurance because the plan excludes viral illnesses. Ms Younker told NewsNet5 that Miss Vinson, who was visiting her hometown for a few days to plan for her wedding, should have been more careful. Sanitisation process: The store temporarily closed and was cleaned before reopening, but its owner, Anna Younker, said there was a lingering 'stigma' and business failed to bounce back . 'I wish that now she knew better not to travel. The impact its had on me is huge,' the store owner said. 'Never in a million years did I expect something like this to cause our business to have to close.' Ms Younker said she was particularly offended when Miss Vinson asked for a $480 refund on her bridesmaid dresses. Miss Vinson, who recovered from Ebola nine days after treatment, asked that the shop refund her bridesmaids the $479.89 they paid for their dresses, via her attorney. Ms Younker said the refund request feel like 'a slap in the face'. In January she posted a message to customers on Facebook, announcing that her business would be closing down. 'Despite our best efforts, we simply have been unable to recover,' she wrote. 'The decision for me to close was not easy for me.

"Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness. After surgery, the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened, and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent, which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects – including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue – can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. But experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called EndoPredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500, although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the NHS. Surgeon Hemant Singhal said: 'I think there is a good case for the NHS to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy.' Professor Kefah Mokbel, consultant breast surgeon at St George's Hospital, London, said: 'With this test we can help patients make an informed choice, whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone.' Becca Cornford, a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11, six and four, was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence . She said: 'I dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy. I was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children.' Professor Mokbel operated on Becca in December at the Princess Grace Hospital, London, and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the EndoPredict. A low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds. 'I could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return,' she says. 'There is no treatment that places your chances at zero. But if you have regular monitoring, there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early.'

"(CNN)Two deputies involved in the fatal attempt to arrest Eric Harris in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have been reassigned because of threats against them and their families, Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Monday in a news conference. The deputies were trying to arrest Harris when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot him. Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, ""I'm losing my breath."" Police appear on video saying, ""F*ck your breath,"" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was ""very concerned"" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, ""Taser, Taser,"" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing . On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. ""We are sorry Eric was taken from you,"" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look. Harris' family has said the shooting reveals ""a deep-seated problem"" within the department and has demanded justice, and changes in policy.

"Jack Colback admits Newcastle United's supporters are being left short-changed as the club's sorry season threatens to plunge new depths. The 25-year-old says he is already looking forward to next term given the slump in form which has seen the Magpies lose five on the spin and score just one goal in eight hours. But before this season is out Colback and his team-mates will have to endure planned protests with a boycott of Sunday's match against Spurs set to see thousands stay away from St James’ Park. Jack Colback (left) says the Newcastle United fans deserve more following another disappointing defeat . Newcastle lost six in a row at the same stage 12 months ago and the atmosphere inside the ground was toxic during the final home game as fans targeted manager Alan Pardew and owner Mike Ashley. One year on and John Carver’s threadbare squad is in real danger of being sucked into a relegation scrap should their ruinous run continue. And Colback accepts that their current effort is far from the standard required. The midfielder was one of the only players who deserves credit this season and put in a shift against Liverpool . ‘This is a huge club which deserves more than it is getting at the moment,’ said the midfielder, who was part of another lacklustre display during Monday’s 2-0 defeat at Liverpool. ‘It’s a difficult situation we’re in – we’ve not got a lot of players. ‘But we can’t feel sorry for ourselves. We’ve got to make sure we perform this weekend. ‘If we play like we did in spells (at Liverpool) then we can pick up the wins we need to get this season out of the way and look to progress next year.’ Carver says Ashley has promised him that the squad will undergo major renovation work this summer. Moussa Sissoko was sent off for a terrible tackle on Lucas Leiva to add to John Carver's woes . The head coach has raised concerns about the character of the players after they lost a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby last weekend. But Colback said: ‘The character is there in the team, even though we didn’t show it last week (at Sunderland). ‘We had to show a reaction at Liverpool because last week was nowhere near good enough. ‘The minimum we could do is be better than the last game and I thought we were. ‘We should have done better with their first goal and it was a shame we took until then to react. We created the odd chance. ‘The penalty decision (Ayoze Perez was fouled by Dejan Lovren with the score at 1-0) was massive, it might have been a different game if we’d got that. Nothing seems to be going our way at the moment. Ayoze Perez (centre) was denied a stonewell penalty by under-fire referee Lee Mason in the first half . ‘But we’re not going to get any sympathy, we’ve still lost the game.’ Carver, meanwhile, will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save the season.

The Croatian midfielder pulled up in the second half against Malaga on Saturday and tests on Sunday confirmed a sprained ligament in his right knee with a recovery time of between five and six weeks. The news comes as the club wait to assess the full extent of Gareth Bale's calf injury, picked up in the same game.

He scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax.’ And most Real Madrid supporters see Modric as even more important to the team.

Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. Researchers have found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. A stock image is shown . The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. On a game reserve co-owned by Sean Hensman, three elephants passed the smell tests. Sniffing at buckets, they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. ‘They work it out very, very quickly,’ he said. Stephen Lee, head scientist at the US Army Research Office, which backed the study financially, said that elephants remember their training longer than dogs. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones.

Scientists from the University of Tokyo said elephants have the largest number of genes dedicated to smell of any mammal. They have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent - twice as many as dogs and five times as many as humans. Previous studies have shown that the animals have well-developed olfactory systems that include large olfactory bulbs and areas in the brain. They seem to be able to distinguish between two Kenyan ethnic groups—the Maasai, who spear elephants to demonstrate strength, and the Kamba, who pose little threat to the animals. The ability of elephants to detect explosives was first noticed in Angola - a country that many elephants had returned to after a 2002 peace deal ended a protracted war. While there was peace, the land remained sown with mine fields. Some elephants seemed to intentionally avoid them, though it might not have been a scent that kept them away - they could instead have associated those areas with danger because elephants had died there in the past. Researchers decided to investigate and in Bela-Bela, a town north of the South African capital of Pretoria, elephants named Shan, Mussina and Chishuru were administered smelling tests. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets, according to Ashadee Kay Miller, a zoology student at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. They only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive, which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper. In an experiment

"Researchers have completed the first comprehensive study of the microbes living on and in and uncontacted tribe from the Amazon. They say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us - and that the bacteria they found could be potentially beneficial to modern society. Researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the Amazonian region of South America. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are hunter-gatherers. They gather wild bananas, seasonal fruits, palm hearts and cassava. They hunt birds, small mammals, crabs, frogs, small fish and the occasional peccary, monkey or tapir. The group doesn't grow food or domesticate livestock. The researchers found that Yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. 'That tells us that Western diets and lifestyles have a great impact on our microbiomes', experts at University of San Diego said. 'Studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics, sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors,' said study co-author Rob Knight. In the new study published April 17 by Science Advances, researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. This information revealed, for the first time, the species of bacteria that co-exist with people who have never been exposed to industrialized society, including Western food and antibiotics. 'Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body,' the researchers wrote. Many Yanomami now regularly interact with Western civilization through trade, but some villages have never had contact with non-Yanomami people. One such unmapped village was first spotted by an army helicopter passing overhead in 2008. In 2009, a medical mission landed there. As part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered. The samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study. Yanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests . Thousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international. The Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade. The Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a

He took the Serie A side into the Europa League semi-final with an emphatic 6-3 aggregate victory over Wolfsburg and the impending encounters against Dnipro will be Benitez's seventh major European semi-final in 12 seasons.

That achievement, alongside the two La Liga titles he won during his three-year spell at the Mestalla, caught the eye of Liverpool, who swooped to bring the Spaniard in as Gerard Houllier's replacement. His first Premier League season was one of adjustment but in Europe, Benitez flourished. He recorded his most stunning glory to date, masterminding what on paper was a woefully uninspiring Liverpool team to Champions League glory, overcoming a star-studded AC Milan side that boasted the likes of Cafu, Paolo Maldini, Kaka and Andriy Shevchenko in the final. Benitez maneuvered Liverpool back to the Champions League final in 2007, eliminating Barcelona on the way with a win at the Nou Camp, only for Milan to avenge their defeat two years prior with a 2-1 victory. The Spaniard manipulated another assault on Europe's elite trophy the following year but Liverpool were knocked out in the semi-final by Chelsea. Off-field ownership turmoil derailed Benitez's team and Liverpool have not even threatened to emerge as a challenger for club football's most prestigious competition since. They were eliminated in the group stage of the tournament in 2010, where a third-placed finish resulted in demotion to the Europa League. But Benitez guided Liverpool to the semi-finals of Europe's secondary competition, where a Diego Forlan strike in extra-time at Anfield sent Atletico Madrid to the final, where they beat Roy Hodgson's Fulham. The Spaniard was sacked as Liverpool manager at the end of the 2010 season and Hodgson replaced Benitez, who ended up at Chelsea as interim manager in 2012 via a short spell at Inter Milan.

"It has famously been a showcase for fast cars, flash watches and high-class liquor - but the latest Bond instalment is set to go one step further by promoting an entire country for tax-breaks. The new movie, Spectre, will be a truly pro-Mexican affair with beautiful shots of the country, a leading role for one of the nation's most glamorous actress and a strict rule that Bond's nemesis is not from Mexico. In exchange for these considerable lengths, the Hollywood producers making the film, who are under pressure to cut their huge budget, will have an extra £14million to spend how they choose. Scroll down for video . Starring role: Glamorous Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman was recently unveiled as new Bond girl Estrella . The Central American country, where the iconic opening scene takes place, offered Hollywood producers a fortune as an incentive to film there, but their generosity came with conditions. Stephanie Sigman, one of Mexico's rising stars, was recently unveiled as Bond girl Estrella, appearing alongside Italian Monica Bellucci, who plays Lucia Sciarra. The Mexican actress, 27, is best known for her role in the award-winning Mexican film Miss Bala, in which she played a beauty queen forced to do a gang's dirty work after witnessing a murder. In addition, Mexico also asked that an assassination target in the film, the Mayor of Mexico City, be changed to an international leader, The Telegraph reports. Tax incentives: It is believed that Hollywood producers making the new Bond movie will save as much as £14million by showing Mexico in a favourable light . These measures are said to have secured tax breaks worth £10million. Around £4million was said to have been earned by filming flattering shots of the country's 'modern' skyline and replacing a cage fighting scene with footage of Mexico's renowned Day of the Dead festivities. Stephanie Sigman will be the first Mexican-born Bond girl on the big screen, but not the first overall. Mexico's Linda Christian - the original Bond girl - starred in the 1954 television adaptation of Casino Royale. The movie's alterations were reported by US website Tax Analysts, which provides information on tax news, based on emails leaked in last year's Sony hacking scandal. Large numbers of internal emails were released by Guardians of the Peace, which the FBI has since identified as a North Korean-backed group of hackers. According to the leaked emails Spectre's budget was at one point exceeding £200 million - which would have made it one of the most expensive films in history. Studio executives spoke of being under 'immense pressure' to reduce the budget. The plan to give Mexico a flattering portrayal was outlined in a memo titled 'Elements needed to preserve Mexican deal'. It spoke of how producers should cast a 'known Mexican actress' as Estrella and female villain Sciarra 'cannot be Mexican'. It also called for aerial shots of 'modern Mexico City buildings'. Rising star: Ms Sigman (pictured left in an advert for her hit Mexican film Miss Bala) will star alongside Daniel Craig and Italian actress Monica Bellucci, who

"Fewer families are taking holidays during term time in the wake of a government crackdown on absenteeism, new figures suggest. The number of days missed by holidaying pupils decreased by almost a third in the past year after a ban on taking children out of lessons for trips. Parents have been fined up to £1,000 and even taken to court since the new policy came into force in September 2013. Drop: Figures reveal just 3million school days were missed by pupils last year - down 1.4million on 2012-13 . Yesterday, Department for Education figures showed 3million days were missed for holidays in 2013-14, down from 4.4million in 2012-13. The latest figure represents a decrease of more than two fifths from 2009-10, when 5.3million days were missed. Government statisticians said the drop has been fuelled by a fall in the number of authorised breaks - trips approved by the school. There has been a slight rise in the number of unauthorised holidays - indicating that some parents may be deciding to take their child out of school without permission, and instead run the risk of a fine. The latest figures, for the last academic year, are the first to show the impact of strict new rules on pupil absence introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove. Under the changes, heads are now only able to grant leave in ‘exceptional circumstances’ and parents can be fined £60 per pupil for taking term time holidays without permission. The cost rises to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Fines: The drop is being credited on the new fines system, which sees parents landed with a £60 penalty if they take their children out of school for an 'unauthorised' absence . Those who fail to pay can face prosecution, with a maximum fine, if convicted, of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. The National Association of Head Teachers released guidance stating exceptions could be made for family funerals and religious events, but family holidays were unlikely to meet the criterion. Campaigners have said the rules impact the hardest on poorer families who cannot afford high travel costs during school breaks, and families with parents that work shifts on or rosters. Travel companies increase their prices significantly in peak seasons when there is more demand. School Reform Minister Nick Gibb said: ‘Every single lost day counts - which is why as part of our plan for education we have put teachers back in charge so they can clamp down on classroom absence. ‘Fewer school days are being lost than ever before thanks to our reforms - giving children the best possible chance to succeed.’

"Last year’s Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid are still in the Champions League... just. After 120 exhausting minutes Diego Simeone’s side won on penalties with Fernando Torres scoring the home side’s last spot-kick and Stefan Kiessling missing his to put Atletico through. The dramatic climax began with Raul Garcia blazing the first kick over the bar. Substitute goalkeeper Jan Oblak saved Hakan Calhanoglu’s awful spot-kick hit low and straight down the middle to put the Spaniards back in with a chance of progress. Fernando Torres celebrates scoring his penalty which put Atletico Madrid into a crucial 3-2 lead during the shootout . Torres congratulates substitute goalkeeper Jan Oblak following the Slovenian's impressive performance . Leverkusen's goalkeeper Bernd Leno is unable to stop Torres' penalty, leaving the German side with a mountain to climb . Oblak jumps for the decisive penalty from Stefan Kiessling, but didn't need to make a save as the shot sailed over his crossbar . Atletico Madrid players sprint towards Oblak's goal after Kiessling misses his penalty and hands the home side victory .

Referee: Nicola Rizzoli (Bologna) Antoine Griezmann stepped up and showed everyone how penalties should be taken scoring high into the roof of the net. Simon Rolfes did likewise to level the scores and Mario Suarez scored his second goal of the night having put Atletico ahead in normal time. When Omer Toprak put his kick nervously over the bar Atletico looked to have the finish line in sight only for Bernd Leno to save Koke’s kick. Gonzalo Castro then scored but after Torres had snuck his penalty just inside Leno’s right hand upright Kiessling missed and the Calderon erupted with joy. Atletico came into the game one goal down from the first leg and struggled to make in-roads early on with a Koke free-kick not really testing Leno. Simone’s team knew one lapse on the break would need them leaving to score three and when Son Heugn-Min was put through by Bender on 22 minutes it was his miscontrol that prevented him getting a shot on target.

"(CNN)The best part of the Supreme Court oral arguments about marriage equality was when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg alluded to S&M. OK, she didn't actually mention S&M, but Ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago, when it was ""a dominant and a subordinate relationship."" ""Yes, it was marriage between a man and a woman, but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled,"" said Ginsburg. ""It was her obligation to follow him."" Mary Bonauto, the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same-sex couples who petitioned the Supreme Court, said in response: ""That's correct. ... For centuries we had and Europe had this coverture system where a woman's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles. And again, because of equality and changing social circumstances, all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated."" Once upon a time, wives were the legal property of their husbands and ""marital rape"" was not only not a crime but not even a concept. To argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully naïve. Justice Anthony Kennedy, widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines, at one point referred to ""the nobility and the sacredness of marriage."" Which is true, if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present. If anything, the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people. One downside to arguing that marriage has ""always been"" between a man and a woman is that, therefore, any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples, too. The one justice who didn't ask a question is Clarence Thomas, who, with one slight exception, has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench. It should be carefully noted here that Thomas is a black man married to a white woman. Anti-miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in Maryland. That means that by 1967, when the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of such laws, bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the American ""definition"" of marriage for over 300 years. Just 20 years after the Supreme Court struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states, Clarence Thomas and his wife, Virginia, were married. James Braxton Peterson, director of Africana Studies at Lehigh University, has written, ""The fact that the Thomas' marriage required progressive Supreme Court action must in some way inform their sense of this moment."" Or maybe not. Clarence Thomas didn't say one way or the other, though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he's firmly opposed to the Supreme Court doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own. But perhaps the example of Clarence Thomas speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments

"(CNN)For Max, the passage of Indiana's new religious freedom law feels a lot like high school. Max is transgender. The 26-year-old was born a female but identifies as a man. That was a tough experience in Evansville: looking like a girl, everyone treating you like one, but not feeling at home in your skin. Classmates made fun of him. He withdrew. He and his parents fought. Now they don't talk. Making it to his mid-20s feels like a victory to him now, as does knowing that he has friends who support him, friends who are straight and gay and transgender. He had just gotten to a point of feeling accepted when the Indiana state legislature passed the Religious Freedom Act. ""This law makes me feel like I'm being bullied all over again,"" he said. ""If I go into a restaurant and the owner doesn't like me because I'm transgender, because their religion has told them that I'm bad, does that give them the right to refuse to serve me? Proponents of the law, including Gov. Mike Pence, say that's not what the law will do. He has said it's intended to prevent the government from forcing anyone to do something that opposes their religious beliefs. Some businesses and Indianans are behind him. Nationally influential Christian evangelist Franklin Graham, who lives in North Carolina, tweeted this week, ""Thank God for politicians like @GovPenceIN who are not afraid to take a stand regardless of political consequences."" But there is a tidal wave of opposition throughout the state and across the country. Critics say the law is a thinly veiled mechanism to legally sanction discrimination. Protests have raged throughout the state and elsewhere. Some religious leaders oppose it. Civic groups, corporations and state governments, such as Washington state and Connecticut, are vowing not to to do business with Indiana. The Indiana Chamber of Commerce has blasted the law. So has the N.C.A.A. Its college basketball tournament is hosting the Final Four in Indianapolis this weekend. Some businesses in the state are reacting by placing signs in windows that read, ""We serve everyone."" Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a vocal opponent of the law, demanded: ""Fix this law. ...

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists keeping Kevin Mirallas happy is key to holding on to him in the summer. There has been plenty of speculation about the Belgium international and he even admitted himself in February he fancied a new challenge and had an ambition to play in the Champions League next season. Injuries have prevented the 27-year-old from really finding his best form this campaign with a run of consistent performances but Martinez was delighted to see him score his first Premier League goal since December 28 in last weekend's win over Burnley. Kevin Mirallas has been linked with a move away from Everton following an injury-hit term at the Toffees . Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits to not knowing what the future holds for his Belgian star . There were reports this week Tottenham would try to make the forward part of a swap deal with their winger Aaron Lennon, who is currently on loan at Goodison Park. However, Martinez backed Mirallas to put the continuing debate about his future to one side. 'The total honest truth is we don't know what is going to happen in the future,' he said. 'I heard somewhere that he had one year left and it was a bit of an unsettled situation but that is not the case, he has two years left. 'I don't think it has ever been an issue. Sometimes there has been too much said on the outside. 'With any footballer now it does not matter whether you have one year or six years left, what is more important is being happy, feeling ready to be part of the project and be an important player going forward.

'When you see him on the pitch he is someone who brings a real desire to score goals, he brings us a goalscoring threat which is quite special and all I want is for Kevin to enjoy his football and carry on performing well. 'He is someone who takes responsibility on the pitch, wants to make things happen and scoring the goal was an important moment. 'Kevin has always been a really hard-working player day-to-day and I have seen him progressing but I have never seen an issue in his performances at all. 'The way he performed on Saturday showed that. In every window you have to sit down and make sure everyone who is fully committed is ready to be part of the future.

"Boris Berezovsky was killed in his bathroom because he was preparing to give Vladimir Putin evidence of a plot involving leading oligarchs to topple the strongman in a coup, it was claimed today. The exiled Russian tycoon was slain by Western secret services linked to the plan to overthrow the Kremlin leader. The theory comes from Berezovsky's former long-time head of security Sergei Sokolov, who disputed the version of British police that the ex-billionaire took his own life, aged 67, in Berkshire in March 2013. Scroll down for video . 'Convinced': Berezovsky's former head of security Sergei Sokolov says he knows his boss did not take his own life - and alleges he was killed by Western secret services over evidence of a plot to overthrow Putin . 'I am convinced it was done by the Western secret services,' he said. 'If Berezovsky's death is a puzzle for you, it is a problem solved for me. Boris was killed simply because he possessed certain secret information and was going to make it public. This is not just my guess, I know it for sure.' Sokolov, the head of a major Moscow private security agency, said his ex-boss was intent on returning to Russia, and had opened negotiations with Putin on allowing him back despite years of bitter opposition to the president. 'Boris forwarded Vladimir Putin a letter with repentance,' he said. Deceased: Boris Berezovsky, left, was found dead at his ex-wife's home in Berkshire in March 2013. An outspoken critic of Putin, he is said to have sent the Kremlin leader a 'letter of repentance' and was planning his return to Russia . 'It was a part of the big venture he had been planning. Berezovsky was living and looking forward to his return to Russia. Of course, he was hoping for indulgence. 'Boris was killed only because he possessed information which he was going to share with Putin. 'I am absolutely sure that Boris had video and audio evidence about certain oligarchs who offered to organise a coup in the country, promising him to be seen as being at the head of the attack.

'Western secret services are still chasing it. Boris was not a predictable guy, who would keep precious information under the pillow in his house.' He claimed that Berezovsky had inside information from MI6 about Russia. 'I knew that Boris was in close relations with MI6, Mossad and the CIA,' he claimed.

"Pregnant women who suffer extreme morning sickness are at greater risk of their children having language and speech delays, and attention disorders, warn researchers. A new study shows the condition suffered by the Duchess of Cambridge during both her pregnancies triples the risk of developmental problems compared with women who have normal nausea and vomiting. About 10,000 women a year in the UK are affected by the debilitating hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) - a severe form of morning sickness which causes constant vomiting, crippling weakness and dehydration. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum - the severe morning sickness suffered by Kate Middleton - are more likely to have children with language and speech delays, and attention disorders, a study claims . A new study from the University of California, Los Angeles, (UCLA) looks specifically at whether the condition affects brain development in childhood. Marlena Fejzo, an associate researcher in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said the link appeared to be due to lack of nutrition in early pregnancy – especially in the first five weeks – rather than medication. She said: ‘These findings show that it is vital to take HG seriously so these pregnant women can get nutritional support right away. ‘An encouraging finding is that we did not find any association with medications to treat this disorder and neurodevelopmental delays, so I speculate that the neurodevelopmental outcomes are more likely caused by nutrient deficiency early in pregnancy rather than medication.’ The research appears in the online edition of the European Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Reproductive Biology. The study looked at 312 children born to 203 mothers with HG between 2007 and 2011 and compared those to 169 children born to 89 mothers who did not have HG. More than 1,000 women with severe morning sickness have an abortion each year because their symptoms are so unbearable, research shows. Many are denied vital yet relatively cheap treatment by GPs who expect them to simply ‘get on with it’ or end their pregnancy. The condition Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) – which the Duchess of Cambridge has suffered during both her pregnancies – affects about one in 100 expectant mothers a year. It is far more severe than ordinary morning sickness and some women are left bedbound or need to be admitted to hospital due to extreme dehydration. Research by abortion provider BPAS and Pregnancy Sickness Support found many women were refused treatment because doctors deemed it too costly, unnecessary or potentially harmful. The disorders found included attention and sensory disorders and learning, speech and language delays. Dr Fejzo said the mechanism for exposure to HG and the resulting abnormal neurologic development is not clear. The women in the study experienced nausea and vomiting so severe that they lost at least five pounds and became so dehydrated they needed intravenous fluids. Children exposed in the womb to HG had a 3.28-fold increased risk of neurodevelopmental delays. Dr Fejzo said: ‘There is an urgent need to address whether aggressive treatment that includes vitamin and nutrient supplementation in women with early symptoms of

"Winston Reid has expressed his delight at signing a new contract with West Ham and said their imminent move to the Olympic Stadium was a big factor in his decision. The New Zealand defender put pen to paper on a six-and-a-half-year contract worth £60,000-a-week. And the 26-year-old, who had been linked with moves to Arsenal and Tottenham with his contract expiring in the summer, is pleased to have his future tied down. Winston Reid has agreed a new six-and-a-half-year contract with West Ham . Reid had been linked with a move at the end of the season to either Tottenham Hotspur or Arsenal . He told fanbookz.com: 'Obviously I'm absolutely delighted to have signed a new contract with West Ham. I've enjoyed my time here, and I just needed to make sure that the decision was a right one for me and my family. 'There were a lot of factors that I took into account when I was making my decision, but most importantly I felt that I was valued at the club - we will be improving in future seasons and I really feel at home here. 'With regards the decision that I've had to make, I had to be sure that it was going to be a place that I was going to be for the next few years of my life, so I have to feel at home and I feel welcome here. I enjoy living in London and my family is settled so that was the most important thing I had to think about.' Reid took his time in making a decision but clearly feels his future lies with the club having made 27 appearances across all competitions this season. He added: 'It might have been frustrating for the fans to have it drag out for so long, but whenever I've been asked this question over the past few months it's just been when we've been negotiating. 'You don't sort something out in the course of one day, there's always got to be some sort of give or take when doing these things. 'There was no big drama towards it, and there was a lot of stuff in the press that was misleading with regards to my situation, but the main thing is that now we've got it sorted. 'Both the club and I were keen to do something, and I'm happy to be staying here. Speaking to the chairman it was clear that the club is on the up, we've been getting better this year but we were realistic about the club and where it's at currently - there's a lot that we can still improve on, and that was the main thing.'

"Bans on texting and driving may be preventing deadly car accidents in the United States, says a new study. Researchers from Texas A&M School of Public Health found that hospitalizations from car crashes dropped 7 percent between 2003 and 20010 in the 45 states with texting bans when compared to states with no restrictions. The research report recently published in the American Journal of Public health could 'not prove' that a texting ban is what caused the critcal injury drop, though they said it was a likely cause. Most states: Most of the US has laws that ban drivers from texting while at the wheel to prevent accidents . Dangerous: Drivers between the ages of 25 and 40 are the most likely group of people to get in an accident related to texting and driving . Arizona, Texas, Montana, Missouri, and Oklahoma are the only five states in America that do not have texting at the wheel bans for all drivers. CBS reports that the study's leader Alva Ferdinand said that while it could not be proven that the lowered rate of hospitalization due to car accidents was caused by texting bans, the restrictions are still linked to a decline in crashes. Ferdinand said that the greatest benefit was seen in states where texting bans are strictly enforced and where an officer can stop a car just on suspicion the driver breaking the law. 'Some states have secondary enforcement,' Ferdinand explained. 'In those states, law enforcement has to catch you doing something else first -- like speeding or running a red light -- and then determine that you were texting.' The study also found that older drivers were more likely to make a texting and driving mistake than a younger driver. 'It's adults, too,' Ferdinand said. 'They're constantly checking emails and text messages.' Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA), said that adults between the ages of 25 and 40 were most likely to get in a texting and driving accident. Slow reaction time: Texting at the wheel is dangerous for drivers because it slows down their reaction times . The research group found that texting bans caused a 9 per cent drop in car-crash hospitalizations among Americans aged 22 and older. Even though young people benefited from the texting ban, the drop in hospitalizations was not numerically significant. There is a lack in data on texting and driving but Adkins believes that as more studies show more results in favour of the ban, more states will be likely to implement it. Adkins said that drivers should avoid texting while at the wheel at all costs even if they consider themselves to be good multitaskers. 'It should push those states with weaker laws to strengthen them,' Adkins told CBS. Research shows that texting at the wheel may be dangerous because it slows reactions more than drink or drugs. A study last year found sending a text message delays reaction times by 37 per cent. By comparison, using cannabis slows it by 21 per cent, and drinking to the

"(CNN)They may not be ""Star Trek""-type extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says. ""I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years,"" NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe. ""We know where to look. We know how to look,"" she said. ""In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road."" NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. ""Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice,"" the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms. ""We are not talking about little green men,"" Stofan said at the panel. ""We are talking about little microbes."" Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. ""I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star,"" he said. And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? ""Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low,"" he said. ""And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting.""

"A Waitrose magazine showcasing the food of Israel has been hammered online for ignoring what activists regard to be the 'illegal occupation of Palestine'. The supermarket chain's monthly food magazine 'Waitrose Kitchen' contained a 32-page brochure called Taste of Israel. But the glossy advert, sponsored by Israel's Government Tourist Board, has sparked outrage among campaigners - with some claiming it ignores what they believe is an 'apartheid regime'. Scroll down for video . A 32-page brochure called Taste of Israel (pictured) within Waitrose Kitchen Magazine has been hammered on the internet . The Waitrose magazine features a glossy pull-out featuring recipe ideas and an 'A-Z food glossary' of Israeli ingredients and dishes . Others have posted harrowing images taken during last year's Gaza conflict. The travel and food pull-out, in the February edition, contains an 'A-Z food glossary' of Israeli ingredients and dishes as well as a guide of its 'Top 10 restaurants'. It also includes 'market tours' interviews with top Israeli chefs and an article explaining 'Why Israeli wine is winning awards, plus five wines to taste.' Recipes in the insert include shakshuka, white fish on vegetable ragu, endive salad, and 'instructions for creating the perfect falafel and hummus'. Backlash: The advert sparked anger online with some saying it ignored what campaigners described as an 'apartheid' Outrage: Some threatened to boycott the supermarket chain after learning of the contents of the magazine . Anger: One Twitter user accused Waitrose and the Israel Tourist Office of 'pushing Israeli propaganda' Criticism: Others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation . The Palestine Solidarity Campaign called the insert 'disgraceful' adding: 'The booklet is a prime example of Israeli government propaganda, highlighting its efforts to distract the public abroad from its brutal military occupation of Palestinian land by replacing the image of an apartheid regime with that of a tourist-friendly, culture-loving country.' Activisits took to Twitter with some vowing to boycott Waitrose - and encouraging others to follow suit. One user, Rory Evans, wrote: Nothing like the taste of falafel with a side-order of apartheid, is there @waitrose #tasteofisrael.' Another Twitter user, 'Paul in Brighton' said: 'Waitrose and Israel Tourist Office are pushing Israeli propaganda 'Taste of Israel' using @waitrose #tasteofIsrael.' One said that the magazine 'erases Palestinian history and culture' while others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation. However, some hit back at criticism of Waitrose, with one urging activists to 'leave war and politics out of cooking.' A number of users posted pictures of the advert along with messages demanding an apology from Waitrose . Some Twitter users hit back at criticism of Waitrose, with one urging activists to 'leave war and politics out of cooking' Ilir Dema wrote: 'Perhaps @waitrose genuinely wants to promote cooking, why is that propaganda?'

"Andrew Hennells, pictured, posted a message on Facebook admitting his plans to rob a Tesco supermarket 15 minutes before holding up staff . An armed raider threatened staff at a Tesco supermarket with a knife less than fifteen minutes after he boasted on Facebook that he was going to rob the store. Andrew Hennells, 31, of Gaywood, King's Lynn posted the message 'Doing. Tesco. Over' at 7.25pm on Friday, February 13. Withing a quarter of an hour, Norfolk Police received an emergency call that a man brandishing a knife was demanding cash from staff at the supermarket. Hennells fled the scene before police arrived but he was arrested by armed police in a nearby pub with £410 in stolen cash. Norfolk Crown court heard that officers also recovered a knife. Hennells, who appeared in court by video link from Norfolk Prison admitted one count of robbery and one count of carrying a knife as an offensive weapon. Judge Katherine Moore adjourned the case until April 8 as she requested full pre-sentence and medical reports on Hennells. The judge said: 'I want all the up-to-date information as to his mental state.' Judge Moore remanded Hennells in custody and warned him that all sentencing options would be open. 'These are serious matters,' she said. Commenting after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Pete Jessop, of King's Lynn CID, said a member of the public had tipped them off about the robbery. He said: 'We have not got to the bottom of why he posted the pictures and words on Facebook, or why he did the job in the first place. 'It was bizarre and an unusual set of circumstances. 'While the message and pictures on Facebook did not solve the case, it did confirm what we already knew. 'But the thing that made it easier and quicker for us to solve the case was the assistance from the public. 'However, the quickness does not take away from its seriousness or how traumatic it was for the victims of the robbery.' Hennells also posted on Facebook hours before carrying out the robbery that he had 'shared' a Bare Knuckles Gypsies' 'The hardest man in Ireland' video. Hennells posted this message only 15 minutes before threatening staff at Tesco's in King's Lynn . Earlier in the afternoon of the raid, Hennells posted a photograph of a large knife on his Facebook page .

"Mechanic Clive Howard carried out a string of rapes and attempted kidnaps on lone women in Norwich, Suffolk and Cambridge over a 28 year period . A mechanic who lived a calm, quiet life with his elderly parents was all the time living a secret double life as a sex attacker. Clive Howard, 56, of Suffolk, has admitted carrying out a string of rapes and kidnaps of women during a 28 year period. The serial rapist confessed to the crimes after he was caught after raping a woman at a car park in Norwich when his number plate was recorded on CCTV. But police fear he may have carried out even more attacks across three different counties and have appealed for any victims to come forward. Detective Sergeant Chris Burgess, of Norfolk Police rape investigation unit said: 'Cases like this don't come up very often - we're talking about a serial rapist. 'We want to give people the chance to come forward.' Howard, who lived a double life with his parents, had initially denied the rape in Norwich but changed his plea on the day of his trial. At a hearing at Norwich Crown Court he admitted seven counts of rape, three charges of attempted kidnap and one count of attempted rape, between 1986 and 2014. Howard, of Battisford, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, was caught by police after he attacked a woman in St Helens Wharf car park, Norwich, on May 30 2014. The victim, in her 20s, was walking home after a night out when she was given a lift by Howard, who then raped her. She tried to take a picture of the car's registration number but Howard grabbed her phone and hurled it into a bush before he sped off. The woman found it before dialling 999. Police were able to get part of the car's number plate from CCTV - and that led them straight to Howard, the registered owner. He was arrested and charged a few days later. Det Sgt Burgess said Howard had done 'two to three loops' around the city 'before he managed to pick his victim'. After he was charged Howard's DNA was put into the national police database which raised an unsolved case in Cambridgeshire in 2013. Howard was caught after part of his Volvo number plate was captured on CCTV after he raped a woman . Howard's number plate was recorded after he parked at St Helens Wharf in Norwich and raped the woman . Detectives found 'striking similarities' to the Norwich assault. Howard's DNA matched a profile obtained during an investigation into the attempted kidnap of a woman in her 20s on May 5, 2013 in Cambridge park Christ's Pieces. The woman managed to fend off Howard, scratching him in the process, and DNA was later retrieved from underneath her fingernail. He was linked to three other attempted kidnappings in Cambridge, one of which happened just 30 minutes before he struck in Christ's Pieces. Howard also tried to abduct two women in the city on February 15, 2014, during the night. Det

"Sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others, a recent study claimed . The implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding, it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders. This is because the genes that make up the people who we are, and the environments in which we are raised cannot be considered independently of each other. The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, a study found. Johnny Savile (left) is accused of abusing seven women, while Jimmy Savile (right) raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse . The research analysed DNA from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. It found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population. In seeking to explain this connection, the researchers found that in only 2 per cent of cases could this familial connection be explained by shared environmental factors. This can include social or environmental aspects of their upbringing that siblings would have experienced together. On the other hand, their shared genetics were a factor in 40 per cent of cases, with the remaining 58 per cent of cases stemming from environmental factors not shared between family members. Genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child molestation (46 per cent) than for adult rape (19 per cent). While the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending, it cannot of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved. Dr Mairi Levitt says that genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment . Putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents. Of course genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment. As can be seen from the percentages above, the largest proportion of cases involved a large, rag bag of environmental factors that are by far the greatest influence on behaviour. You may not have been born a criminal, but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour. This is according to a recent study which found that experiences, such as divorce and sexual abuse, could affect gene expressions that control a person's predisposition to delinquency. The study used a survey of 1,337 students aged 17 or 18 in Västmanland, Sweden, who anonymously completed questionnaires reporting on their behaviour. As well as their behaviour, they spoke about past family conflict, experiences of sexual abuse, and the quality of their relationship with their parents. They also provided a sample of

"A troubled socialite who pleaded guilty to dealing drugs from her Range Rover in wealthy suburbs says there wasn't ‘anything difficult about it’ as she hit back at reports she may face up to 10 years behind bars. Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs. The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story recounting her double life as a drug dealer. Scroll down for video . Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs . 'I want to make one point very clear: 1000 pills + 94g of cocaine + $33,000 does not = 10 year gaol,' she wrote on Facebook. 'On averages, what I'm looking at is a 4 year head sentence with probably 2 years parole and 2 years gaol time... minus my 8 months served.' A Current Affair re-enacted the 'sophisticated drug ring' Stockbridge had set up and confronted her on the street for a segment that aired on Wednesday night ahead of her sentencing next month. The program recreated a series of drug deals one day in November 2013 where she collected $5,750 between 4.40pm and 7.30pm from nine deliveries across Sydney. 'The money they're quoting that I made on the night re-enacted is gross of course, not profit,' Stockbridge wrote. 'I'm not sure how anyone could run a sophisticated drug ring from the front seat of their car? And besides, there really isn't anything difficult about it whatsoever.' The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story about her drug dealing . Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society . Stockbridge was arrested at her Darlinghurst home in December 2013 and police found more than 380g of a substance containing MDMA, under 95g of a substance that contained cocaine, a cutting tool for cocaine, resealable bags, 10 mobile phones and $33,620 in cash. Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers she had saved in her phone and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society. The court was also told she sent messages to customers with special deals, including 'buy two grams and get the third half price'. Police started recording evidence of the transactions by bugging her car in September 2013 - a fact Stockbridge says she knew and was careful about.

"This morning observers across Europe were treated to a rare solar eclipse as the moon passed across the face of the sun and obscured it almost entirely from view. But while many, in the UK especially, had to contend with clouds, plenty of images captured the event – and an odd black spot on the sun. While it might have looked like a speck of dust at first, this was actually a sunspot on the solar surface, caused by a concentration of magnetic fields. Scroll down for video . People in the UK were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning. But several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun (shown). These were sunspots, caused by concentrations of magnetic fields. They are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares . Sunspots are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings. They range hugely in size, from just 10 miles (16km) to 100,000 miles (160,000km) - big enough to be seen from Earth without a telescope, and more than ten times the size of our planet. Sunspots are regions where powerful magnetic fields emanate from the sun . These magnetic fields can get wound up so tightly that they rise up from inside the Sun, and the sunspots mark the points where this happens. They are much colder than the rest of the sun's surface and usually last a few days before disappearing. They have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200°C (4,890 to 7,590°F), compared to 5,500°C (9,930°F) for the surrounding solar material, which is why they are so visible. Sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun, namely solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), all of which are linked to magnetic fields. The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. Sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes, regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface. Sunspots (previous Nasa image shown) are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings . Some observers took to Twitter to express their views on the sunspots, which were spotted in live footage showing the moon passing across the face of the sun . Others bemoaned the cloud coverage in the UK, which meant that many observers were unable to actually see the event at all. There were more than 10,000 mentions of the eclipse per minute on Twitter, according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch . The sun goes through a periodic change

"The inquiry into the Iraq war, lead by Sir John Chilcot, began in 2009, stopped taking evidence in 2011, but will not report until 2016, a source said . The findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the Iraq war are unlikely to be unveiled this year. Further delays to Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry into the war were reported by BBC’s Newsnight and will fuel claims those criticised over the war are trying to bury bad news. It was initially thought it would be delayed until after the general election amid claims it could be damning for Labour. But it has now been suggested the findings of the inquiry, which began in 2009, will not be published until 2016. Newsnight’s Diplomatic Editor, Mark Urban said he had been told the inquiry will be delayed until at least 2016. Tony Blair is expected to be come under intense scrutiny for sanctioning the ill-fated invasion. The former PM has denied that he was trying to obstruct the inquiry. Earlier this year, he apeared rattled when journalists put to him David Cameron’s claim, that Labour had got the publication delayed. He pointed to a statement released by his office which said: ‘It is not true to say that Tony Blair has caused the delay in the report’s publication’. Mr Blair is one of dozens who is believed to be criticised. Every one fingered has the right to respond to the dossier of evidence against them, often running to hundreds of pages. The inquiry - which stopped taking evidence in 2011 - was also set back by the death of one of its members and staff losses. The publication of the report was expected to be delayed until after the election as it is thought to be highly critical of senior political figures, including Tony Blair, but will likely not report until even later .

Ed Miliband will be 'held hostage' in Downing Street by the SNP, it was claimed today as Nicola Sturgeon said there was no way Labour could win without her. A dramatic collapse in support for Labour in Scotland is expected to rob Mr Miliband of an overall majority, forcing him to rely on the SNP to form a government. Ms Sturgeon teased the Labour leader today, claiming he is still 'clinging to the pretence' that he has a chance of winning a majority on May 7, insisting she will wield 'clout' in Westminster. Ms Sturgeon said her party was open to an arrangement with Labour after the election. The Scottish First Minister hinted that many of Labour's MPs would support certain SNP policies such as bringing an end to austerity and scrapping Trident. After weeks of pressure, Mr Miliband has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP but he could be forced to do a deal to stop them voting down his government. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'He is still clinging to the pretence he has got some chance of winning an overall majority. 'We have got vast experience as a minority Government ... the principles are the same. You have to build alliances, you have to win votes on a case-by-case basis. 'It would be far better than what usually happens to Scotland at Westminster, which is we are ignored or sidelined. 'The bottom line here is, if Scotland wants to have that influence, that power, that clout in Westminster, the only way get it is to vote SNP. 'If there is real SNP strength in the House of Commons we can force progressive change.' She also repeated the threat from former First Minister Alex Salmond to lock the Tories out of government, even if David Cameron wins the most seats. Brushing aside claims it was arrogant, Ms Sturgeon replied: 'If the Tories can't command a majority, then they don't deserve to be in government.' Labour leader Ed Miliband used the launch of his election campaign at the Olympic Park in east London today to claim: 'There is one way to get the Tories out and that's to elect a Labour government' Senior Conservative William Hague condemned the remarks as proof that Mr Miliband would be propeped up by a party which wanted to break up the Union. He said: 'Now you have it straight from Nicola Sturgeon – it is the SNP's sworn intention to hold Ed Miliband hostage in Downing Street and dictate terms on how Britain is governed. 'And we know too what's in the ransom note: £148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.

"A millionaire has won a legal victory which could see a £10.5 million solar farm removed at a cost of £1.5 million - because it overshadows his Grade II listed home. Daniel Gerber from Broughton Gifford, Wiltshire, was horrified when developers started constructing the 54-acre site on the doorstep of his six-bedroom Grade-II listed home - which is worth almost £3million. He claims he was not informed of the planning application by the local authority - despite the development being just 45 metres from the boundary of his property. Gifford Hall (pictured) Mr Gerber's Grade-II listed home has six bedrooms and is worth almost £3million . Norrington Solar Farm, based near Mr Gerber's home, was opened in June last year at a lost of £10.5 million . Mr Gerber only became aware of the project when he went out for a walk in March last year and found construction was already underway. He took his case to the High Court where he argued that English Heritage should also have been consulted as a listed property was involved. One of the country's top judges, Mr Justice Dove, upheld his claim and has ordered Wiltshire Council to reconsider the planning application for the site. Daniel Gerber (pictured) was 'horrified' when developers started constructing the 54-acre solar farm on the doorstep of his Grade-II listed home . If it is refused the solar farm - which became operational in June last year - may have to be ripped up and the council could be sued by the developers. Mr Gerber, who has lived in Broughton Gifford for five years, has now spoken of his victory for the first time. The father-of-three said he was compelled to act and save the beautiful countryside around his home for future generations.

'You can imagine my shock and horror in March 2014 when I left my house with my two year old to take a walk through our garden into the open countryside. 'I could not believe the scale of the development that had started and immediately rushed back inside to phone Wiltshire Council. 'The decision to place a 22.1 hectare solar farm on productive farmland, next to a Conservation Area and in beautiful, open countryside was made by one person - the planning officer. 'A decision to build a massive, industrial development in the countryside should have gone to the Planning Committee.

"A man rushed to hospital for a kidney transplant has spoken of the dilemma he faced after learning the donor organ could be infected with HIV. Tony Gartside had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney and pancreas had become available. The transplant window was so small that after putting the phone down at 3am, he was rushed from his home in Plymouth to Oxford for the operation. But upon arriving, he was told that the organs had come from the victim of a drugs overdose - and it would be two weeks before tests revealed if they were HIV free. Tony Gartside, 40, had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney had become available. But he faced a dilemma after learning the donor organ could be infected with HIV . Mr Gartside, 40, was born with type 1 diabetes, and his kidneys began to fail by the time he was 32. He said: 'They showed me into a room and told me the donor organs had come from a death by drug overdose and asked if I still wanted to go ahead. 'Because the person died by drug overdose, they wouldn't know whether the donor had HIV for two weeks. 'It was a scary process having to say yes or no after sitting in the back of an ambulance for hours. 'I thought: ""Do I risk it and say yes, or do I say no and wait another 18 months, or even longer?"" 'In the end, I went ahead with it.' The kidney transplant surgery took 10 hours and left Mr Gartside with 32 staples in his stomach. After the surgery, he was sick for days, unable to even stand up straight, and was concerned about the risk of HIV. Two weeks later the HIV results came back - and were, to his relief, negative. He has since made a full recovery. Mr Gartside said: 'My diabetes has completely changed - it's amazing - and even that doesn't describe how good I feel. 'It's a second chance and I will be forever grateful to the donor's parents for making that decision.' Two weeks after the kidney transplant, the HIV results came back - and were negative . He has now set up a support group for transplant patients - the Mayflower Support Group - which supports patients going through the transplant procedure.

Tony Gartside had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney and pancreas had become available. The transplant window was so small that after putting the phone down at 3am, he was rushed from his home in Plymouth to Oxford for the operation.

"A Texas mom who has already spent seven years in prison for the murder of her four-year-old adopted son, and was released shortly before Christmas, will not face new murder charges. Hannah Overton, 37, wiped back tears as she, along with her husband Larry and five children, celebrated news that after having her conviction overturned for poisoning her son, Andrew Burd, with an overdose of salt, prosecutors have dropped all charges against her and will no longer be looking into her case. Throughout her incarceration, her family stood by her and protested her innocence, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka had said shortly after she was released that he would push again for capital murder charges. He could do this as her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, meaning this would not be a case of double jeopardy. Scroll down for video . Hannah Overton (above wiping away tears with her daughter and son) will not be tried on murder charges again in the death of her adopted son . Overton's five children and husband Larry (above) were there to celebrate the news . In a news release however, Skura said that he would not be trying the case again due to 'a myriad of factors which came about after a careful review of the previous trial, re-interviewing some of the key witnesses, consulting with some of the medical experts involved in the case, reviewing evidence adduced at recent hearings and staffing the case with the current prosecutors assigned to the case.' A judge then granted Skura's motion to dismiss. 'Wow, we don't even know where to begin,' Overton said after hearing this news. 'We are so excited about all God has done in and through all of this. He has carried us through.' An appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News. Original prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since. On a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well. When he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning. A week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning. But during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt. The mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared

"Police in North Carolina have spent the past three months searching for an elderly Caucasian bank robber, but instead found a 28-year-old African-American suspect with a penchant for disguise. Benoit Constant, of Maryland, was arrested in Texas during a traffic stop and identified as a suspect in the robbery of a bank in Cornelius, North Carolina, back in December. Police say Constant, who is black, wore a lifelike mask during the heist that made him look like an elderly white man. Master of disguise: Benoit Constant (left), 28, was arrested on robbery charges after police say he held up a North Carolina bank while wearing a lifelike mask of an elderly white man (right) Lifelike: Constant's disguise was recovered from a van that was found in Maryland a week after the robbery . Target: Constant is suspected of robbing the Carolinas Telco Federal Credit Union in Cornelius on December 29 . Constant is facing charges of robbery with a dangerous weapon, making a false bomb threat, evading arrest and failure to identify. He is being held on $70,000 bond. Benoit Constant is suspected of robbing the Carolinas Telco Federal Credit Union in Cornelius on December 29, reported WCNC. Surveillance video from inside the bank showed a white man in dark sunglasses, a baseball cap and blue gloves pointing a handgun at a bank teller with one hand while holding a bag for the cash in the other. Partner in crime: Milandra Constant, Benoit's alleged accomplice, has been charged with making a false bomb threat to create a diversion during the robbery . During the heist, someone also called in a false bomb threat to the Lake Norman YMCA on the other side of town, in what investigators believe was a diversion created by Constant's accomplice to draw police away from the credit union. CCTV cameras captured images of the same silver van with a Delaware registration near the targeted bank and the YMCA, which officials later tracked down to Maryland about a week after the robbery. Constant's alleged partner in crime, Milandra Constant, was behind the wheel of the vehicle. Inside, police found a lifelike mask resembling the bank robber and the striped bag seen in the surveillance footage, according to WSOC-TV. At around 11.30am on Sunday, Benoit Constant was traveling southbound on US-28 in Wichita Falls, Texas, when state troopers stopped his Lexus for a traffic violation. Constant initially gave the troopers a fake name, but when they ran his plates, they found out that the motorist was wanted in North Carolina on robbery charges. The 28-year-old man bolted out of the car and tried to flee on foot but was quickly apprehended in a residential neighborhood. The suspected bank robber is currently awaiting extradition to North Carolina to face charges in connection to the December heist. Milandra Constant, the man's alleged accomplice, has been charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon and making a false bomb threat.

"(CNN)This is the time of the year when Christians the world over -- more than 2 billion of us -- reflect upon the crucifixion and resurrection of our Lord. In light of the tragic massacre of Christian college students in Kenya on Thursday, and the ongoing threat against Christians in other nations, this Holy Week we are calling upon Christians to also reflect upon the crucifixion, beheading, stoning, enforced slavery, sexual abuse, human trafficking, harassment, bombing and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Christians -- and others -- whose faith alone has made them a target of religious extremists. Countless lives have been utterly destroyed in nations such as Iraq, Syria, Libya, Pakistan, India, Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria. In June 2012, Bishop Shlemon Warduni of Iraq told the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, ""We beg you to help. We want only peace, security, and freedom. Please no more death, no more explosions, no more injustice."" By then, nearly every remaining church in Iraq had constructed a blast wall around its building to buffet the threat of the inevitable church bombing. This crisis escalated substantially last summer when ISIS swept like lightning through Iraq's Nineveh province, capturing the country's second-largest city, Mosul; a city that was until 2014 a home of a thriving Christian community, there centuries before Islam. Again and again the world did not respond as it might have, and now the inconceivable has happened: Iraq's Nineveh Plain has been emptied of its ancient Christianity community, which existed there for more than 1,500 years. On March 27, in a presentation to the U.N. Security Council, Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako referred to the present reality of his fellow Iraqi Christians as a ""catastrophic situation."" He's right. Rarely since the first century has the church in the East faced persecution on this scale. Christian communities that took 2,000 years to build, and that were started by the apostles themselves, lie in ashes between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Survivors waste away as refugees, often in deplorable conditions, with no homes or churches to return to if the region eventually stabilizes. Whether they be Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant, Christian communities are united in what Pope Francis has called an ""ecumenism of blood,"" recognizing that Christianity is experiencing more martyrdom today than in the first century. This is not an exaggerated or contrived crisis. As Nina Shea, director of the Hudson's Institute's Center for Religious Freedom, has aptly put it, ""Piece by piece, Middle Eastern Christianity is being shattered."" Our concern is not to the exclusion of anyone else under threat by these religious fanatics, and we reject those who believe that this evil is reflective of the majority of Muslims whose community has actually experienced the most casualties in this conflict. It is also true that Christianity faces a legitimate threat of extinction in several parts of Iraq and Syria and it faces a growing threat in nations such as Nigeria. In solidarity with those being threatened we agree with the words delivered by Jordan's King Abdullah II at the United

"The real-life Paddington bear who suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and fur is closer to finding a new home, thanks to the generosity of Mail on Sunday readers. After the plight of Cholita was highlighted by this newspaper last week, readers donated an extraordinary £30,000 to Animal Defenders International, which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in Peru earlier this month. The elderly bear lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus, where she was kept in a 5ft by 5ft box, and her teeth were broken and her claws removed to prevent her from defending herself. Scroll down for video . Cholita (pictured) lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus in Peru . Cholita - known as the real-life Paddington bear (pictured) - suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and fur . The money raised will allow the organisation to travel more than 600 miles on treacherous mountain and desert roads, which are often little more than dirt tracks, to reach the bear in a zoo near the north-western city of Piura and drive her to the Peruvian capital, Lima. The two drivers and the truck, equipped with a new cage, hay and blankets, will alone cost £2,700, and the bear will also need help from veterinary staff and a support team, who will fly to Piura in advance. When the organisation has cleared the red tape needed to allow Cholita to leave the country, they will fly her and 33 lions they have rescued from other circuses in South America to the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado in the United States, where she can live out her days in peace. Because she is a spectacled bear, the same endangered species as Paddington in the children’s books by Michael Bond, there are stringent conditions to be met before the authorities permit her to cross state boundaries. The organisation, which campaigns against the exploitation of wild animals, will have to delay Cholita’s flight by several weeks to ensure she is allowed aboard, at a further cost of thousands of pounds a day, so it is still appealing for funds. Its president, Jan Creamer, said: ‘We have been overwhelmed by the response from Mail on Sunday readers to help Cholita. We now need one last push so that she can begin her journey to freedom. Please give generously and help us save Cholita and give her the life she deserves.’ Mail on Sunday readers donated an extraordinary £30,000 to Animal Defenders International, which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in Peru earlier this month .

Cholita - known as the real-life Paddington bear - suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and fur . The elderly bear lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus, where she was kept in a 5ft by 5ft box, and her teeth were broken and her claws removed to prevent her from defending herself.","
Mail on Sunday readers donated an extraordinary £30,000 to Animal Defenders International . The money raised will allow the organisation to travel more than 600 miles on treacherous mountain and desert roads . Cholita will be flown to the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado in the United States .

"Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today. Almost one in three crimes is ‘inappropriately’ punished with a police caution or penalty notice, including some that carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, such as rape, MPs say. Some 86,000 offences that could have gone before a Crown Court were dealt with out of court in the year to June 2014, they add. Revelation: Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today . The Home Affairs Select Committee points to an ‘alarming’ rise of the caution culture – which grew and peaked under the Labour government – and says this has damaged public confidence in the justice system. The committee’s report concludes that too often, police used cautions as a ‘time-saving tool’ rather than the correct way of tackling an offence. In total, police issued 318,500 of the so-called out-of-court disposals, mostly for minor offences, in 2013-14, down from 660,965 in 2008. Despite ministers insisting cautions are ‘inappropriate’ for serious offences, 70 sexual and violent offenders a week received one in the past four years. Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said: ‘The inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences is unacceptable. ‘It is alarming that they are not being used in the correct way in up to 30 per cent of cases. ‘We cannot allow the misuse of out-of-court disposals in serious cases to continue. The public deserve to feel reassured that their local police forces are not tackling serious crimes with a slap on the wrist.’ Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said the 'inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences unacceptable. The committee also says the use of cautions has resulted in a ‘postcode lottery’. In Gwent, 49 per cent of offences were brought to justice, compared with 26 per cent in West Yorkshire. At the peak, one in ten of all solved cases was dealt with by out-of-court disposals. By last year, it had fallen to fewer than one in 20. The report found that cautions could save the police time and money by cutting bureaucracy, allowing front-line officers to spend more time pounding the beat. Arresting an offender takes almost three hours of police time, and charging someone takes five hours. But too many cautions were being handed out ‘inappropriately’, says the committee. The report welcomes reforms being introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling that will end the caution culture which led to criminals being let off with a warning. Six types of out-of-court disposals will be replaced with just two which are designed to compel offenders to make some form of reparation. Minor criminals will be told they must apologise to victims or repair damage they have caused to prevent a court appearance. More serious offenders will be give a ‘suspended prosecution’, which means they must meet a set of conditions such

"Six Minnesota men have been charged with terrorism in a criminal complaint unsealed Monday, the latest Westerners accused of traveling or attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped. Scroll down for video . Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, and Adnan Abdihamid Farah, both 19, and their four co-accused have been described as close friends who met secretly to plan their travel to Syria . Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, and the five other men arrested have been accused of being 'intent' on joining ISIS . Charged are Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20. 'These were focused men who were intent on joining a terrorist organization,' Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said at a news conference Monday. The six were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest people from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of Westerners by IS. Authorities said earlier that a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year, and at least one has died. Three of those charged in the newest complaint - Mohamed Farah, Abdurahman and Musse - were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with 19-year-old Hamza Ahmed, but they were not charged until now. Ahmed was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to IS, and attempting to provide material support. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of six Somali-American men from Minnesota, accused of trying to join ISIS. Above, FBI Special Agent Richard R Thornton details the arrests at a press conference, with U.S. Attorney Andrew M Luger to the left . Despite being stopped already, Luger said, the three others continued to try to get to Syria to join IS 'by any means possible.' The complaint describes several interactions some of the men had with Abdi Nur, a Minnesota man charged previously with conspiracy to provide support to a terror organization. The complaint says Nur, 'from his locale in Syria, recruits individuals and provides assistance to those who want to leave Minnesota to fight abroad.' The complaint relies in part on material from a confidential informant who had himself conspired to join IS before he changed his mind and went to authorities. Some of the informant's conversations with the six men were recorded. The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U.S. Since

"Cristiano Ronaldo shed tears of joy when he finally usurped Lionel Messi as the Ballon d’Or winner for 2013. He was also officially crowned the world’s best player, above Messi, for 2014. But here’s the bad news, Cristiano. Despite the gongs and the widely-held opinion that Ronaldo was superior to his great rival over the past two years, Messi still contributed more valuable goals to his club and country in 2013 and 2014. That is the view of the number-crunchers at The Economist, who have calculated the worth of each player's goals, based on how crucial the goal was to the match result (and the subsequent gains from that result), as well as the importance of the game. Lionel Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) in action during last Sunday's El Clasico duel . Messi's Barcelona beat Ronaldo's Real Madrid 2-1 at the Nou Camp, with the Portuguese scoring . The explanations of the precise formulas used and the value of certain matches in relation to others are both long and complicated, so to read them in full click here. Sportsmail’s calculator also seems to be broken, so again to see the full numbers, let The Economists’s boffins guide you through. Be warned, though: the introduction contains a reference to 'The Pythagorean Formula Extended for Soccer', so it’s not for the faint-hearted. But the key facts are these. Messi’s (still fantastic) total of 86 goals over the period does not compare with Ronaldo's superhuman 105. Ronaldo shed tears of joy when he won the Ballon d'Or over Messi in 2013 . The Real Madrid hero stripped off to celebrate his goal in the Champions League final last season . But Ronaldo's penalty against Atletico Madrid was virtually worthless, according to The Economist . Each of Ronaldo’s 105 goals, however, were worth an average of 0.40 points to his team in relation to the most likely result of the match before the goal was scored. By contrast, Messi’s 86 goals were worth an average of 0.47 points each. And if that sounds like gobbledegook, essentially this can be explained in simple terms: a goal in a match where the score is tied 1-1 in the final minutes yields more points (or aggregate value in cup ties) to his team than a goal scored in a match where the player's team is already winning 3-1. The Economist uses Ronaldo’s three goals in the semi-final and final of last year’s Champions League as an example to show their relative lack of value. In the second leg of the semi-final against Bayern Munich, Ronaldo scored when Real led 3-0 and 4-0 on aggregate. And in the final against Atletico Madrid, his penalty in extra-time when Madrid were 3-1 ahead had a virtually negligible value. Messi has rediscovered his best form this season after losing out to Ronaldo since 2013 . Messi is on international duty with Argentina and is pictured here training in Washington . Messi was all smiles here at the 2013 awards nominations but Ronaldo walked off with the prize . The importance of

"If you're looking for the ultimate Easter egg-stravaganza, London's Studio Kitchen at K West Hotel have obliged, with a sweet treat inspired by one of our most popular chocolates. But if the thought of a Crème Egg Burger has your tastebuds recoiling at the horror of a meat patty slathered in crème egg filling, relax - this burger is made entirely from confectionery. And this Frankenstein food - created specially for Easter by chefs in the Studio Kitchen burger lab, K West Hotel & Spa in Shepherds Bush, West London - will be available throughout spring. Scroll down for video . The Crème Egg Burger is more sweet treat than meat feast, with chocolate covered brioche buns, a melted chocolate Crème Egg 'patty', plus strawberry jam filling and lashings of mascarpone cream . Sure to send sugar levels soaring, the mini slider burgers see a gooey melted crème egg playing the part of the patty, slathered in 'ketchup' made from strawberry jelly and sitting on a bed of thickly spread mascarpone cream. Then of course, there are the buns. Slices of sweet brioche, the top layer is dunked in melted white chocolate for a thorough coating, before being sprinkled with colourful hundreds and thousands. More sweet treat that meaty feast, the burgers have gone straight to the top of the Studio Kitchen dessert menu, priced at £5.50 for a portion of two. Served from the end of March 2015 and throughout spring in celebration of Easter, the burgers also appear in the hotel's decadent Spring Rocks Afternoon Tea. The Easter creation follows public outrage over the change in chocolate recipe for classic Cadbury's Crème Eggs. Changes to the classic Dairy Milk chocolate recipe used in Cadbury Crème Eggs sparked public outrage in January, as shoppers were told a sweeter 'standard cocoa mix chocolate' would be used instead this year . A spokesperson for Cadbury, bought by American giant Kraft in 2010, revealed back in January that the nation's favourite chocolate egg will no longer be coated in Dairy Milk. An official announcement stated, 'It’s no longer Dairy Milk. It is similar, but not exactly Dairy Milk.' Chefs at the Studio Kitchen aren't the first to turn Britain's best-loved Easter treat into a new concoction. In 2013 a flury of alcoholic cocktails appeared in bars and clubs, mixing the gooey centre and melted chocolate with spirits and liquor. While The Mint Bar at Ireland's Westin Dublin Hotel served a Creme Egg Cocktail, London's Jewel Bar in Piccadilly Circus mixed-up a chocolatey Creme Egg mojito, which contained almost 1,000 calories. In 2013 The Mint Bar at Dublin's Westin Dublin Hotel served the limited edition Creme Egg Cocktail, mixing vanilla infused Grey Goose Vodka and chocolate-bean flavoured Crème De Cacao, with white chocolate liqueur, cream and mini Cadbury Crème Eggs .

The 50-year-old house husband was seen pushing three-year-old Jordan on the swings at a playground near to his house in downtown Manhattan yesterday. The pair later rushed across town to get pizza. Former US representative Anthony Weiner was spotted taking his son for a quick stroll near his downtown Manhattan home yesterday. They were seen enjoying themselves amid claims Weiner's wife has been caught up in the Hillary Clinton email scandal . They were spotted enjoying themselves as Weiner's wife Huma Abedin faces scrutiny about using a private email account. Abedin is one of three top Clinton aides who reportedly used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state's private server. Senior figures in Congress were already investigating Clinton's communications from 2009-13, which they say were not conducted via official State Department accounts but a 'clintonemail.com' address. Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of communications from the time - but admitted on Tuesday during a news conference that she deleted more than 30,000 emails she decided were personal in nature and unrelated to her job. The 50-year-old house husband made sure he pushed three-year-old Jordan high on the swings before the pair ran off to get pizza . The investigation has now widened after it emerged that one of Abedin's email addresses is Huma@clintonemail.com, showing that she could have also been using the server to conduct official business. Daily Mail Online confirmed the address through Lexis-Nexis, a commercial service that compiles public records. It comes nearly four years after Weiner's own scandal where he resigned from Congress for sending sexually suggestive photographs of himself via his public Twitter account to other women. Longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Abedin (left), shown with then-Secretary of State Clinton during a 2010 diplomatic meeting in Vietnam, was her deputy chief of staff and is expected to play a key roll if Clinton runs for president . At the time he admitted that he had sent images to six women in three years and said that he had stopped. But in 2013 further claims were made that he sent more under the alias 'Carlos Danger' to a 22-year-old woman.

"Arsenal are searching for a fourth consecutive Premier League win at Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday night as they look to chase down second-placed Manchester City. With a nine-point gap to leaders Chelsea, the title looks to be beyond Arsene Wenger's men yet again despite their recent good form. But would finishing as runners-up to Jose Mourinho's men be good enough for a club with 13 titles to its name? Arsenal fan Lee Hurley of blog Daily Cannon tells us whether coming second would be a success for the Gunners. Just four points from second place, Arsenal haven’t finished that high in the league for 10 years and it can be no coincidence that their surge to catch the oil-rich Manchester City comes after the Emirates-austerity period has ended. But while it represents an improvement in the eyes of fans, it can’t be the end of Arsenal’s ambitions and it won’t be seen as success in its own right. This is a club that wins titles, 13 of them for those who think football was just invented in 2005 when Chelsea decided to start buying trophies as they couldn’t win them any other way. Arsenal players look dejected during the Monaco defeat as they now face a daunting second leg comeback . Arsene Wenger found it painful viewing as his Arsenal side capitulated in a 3-1 defeat by Monaco . Alexis Sanchez has been a star performer for the Gunners this season as they seek a top-two finish . In a league that contains clubs who have been outspending Arsenal significantly, to finish second is not to be sniffed at and had it not been for the crippling injury problems that afflicted Arsenal, again, at the start of this season, who knows how much closer to Chelsea they might have been. But that’s how it’s been with Arsenal over the past 10 years – a severe case of the ‘might have beens’ – what might have been had they not lost so many top players to City and Barcelona and United, or if Laurent Koscielny and Wojciech Szczesny not been monumental idiots in the League Cup final, or the oil money not flooded in as soon as the club lay the foundations for the Emirates or Eduardo’s leg not been snapped in 2008 when Arsenal were running away with the league or last season when injuries did the same, albeit in a less dramatic fashion. Or, or, or.... If I’m honest, it's all got a little tedious for many fans, which is why the FA Cup success last season was celebrated so wildly – a nice little change of pace from finishing fourth and embarrassing ourselves in the knockouts. The departures of Thierry Henry (left) and Cesc Fabregas (right) to Barcelona in the past were huge blows . Arsenal players Mathieu Flamini (left), Olivier Giroud (middle) and Aaron Ramsey (right) celebrate FA Cup success in May 2014 - the club's ended a nine-year trophy drought .

"A down-on-their-luck couple from Ohio struggling with chronic conditions that left them unable to make a living were found dead from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning this week, less than two months after their desperate pleas for help went ignored. Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, created online fundraisers on GiveFroward.com and GoFundMe.com in late February begging Good Samaritans for financial help. Mrs Speidel wrote that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and were close to having their electricity and Internet service shut off. Hopeless: Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, Ohio, took their own lives this week, more than two months after they created online fundraisers begging for financial help . Heartbreaking: The middle-aged couple died from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning caused by two charcoal grills they had dragged into their bedroom . Last-ditch effort: Mrs Speidel wrote on GiveForward.com in late February that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and cut down their food intake to one meal a day . After having paid $500 to their landlord to prevent their immediate eviction, Mrs Speidel stated that they were left with only $33 to their name. To stretch their meager funds a little farther, the impoverished, ailing couple were forced to limit their food intake to a single meal a day and did not have enough scraps to feed their two cats. ‘I have turned in every direction possible and don’t know what else to do,’ she wrote. ‘If you can help, we will be forever grateful and will even pay you back once we get back on our feet.’ The Speidles were hoping to raise $1,000, but the online campaign failed to draw any donations whatsoever. On Tuesday, the couple's landlord, Doug Elleman, arrived at their rental at 225 West High Avenue to discover a pink handwritten note warning passersby of carbon monoxide inside, reported Bellefontaine Examiner. Firefighters who were called to the scene entered the residence and discovered a pair of charcoal grills filled with smoldering coals. Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were pronounced dead at the scene. Orpahns: The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa (pictured right as a baby with her father) and 20-year-old Kira Speidel . Columbus Dispatch reported that a note found nearby confirmed that the husband and wife had made a suicide pact. The couple had removed their beloved pet cats from the house to spare their lives. They were later found wandering outside. The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa and Kira Speidel. In a post left last month on her parents' GoFundMe.com page, which has since been removed, 20-year-old Kira called the couple 'the hardest-working people I know.' She went on to say that now that they can no longer work because of their physical ailments, 'they have nowhere to run.' Police Chief Brandon Standley said the town has resources available for people in need like the Speidels, adding that it's tragic that they thought they were all out of options. In one of her online pleas,

Nichols mimics Pacquiao's Visayan accent while poking fun at the 36-year-old's decision to both write and perform his own entrance song as well as ridiculing the 'Pacman's' religious faith. The young boxer also takes a pop at Pacquiao's mother by claiming her 'voodoo powers' are the secret behind his success - so-called 'Mommy D' was accused of using Voodoo chants from ringside during her son's victory over Tomothy Bradley in April 2014. As a parting shot, Nichols refuses to refer to the fight's date in normal English and repeatedly says it will be staged on 'May two, May two!'. The up and coming boxer has not had a professional fight yet but insists he is ready for the challenge of getting Mayweather in prime shape before the contest.

"John Travolta has broken his silence on the controversial Scientology exposé Going Clear and says he never intends to watch the documentary. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times while promoting his upcoming film The Forger, Travolta said his decades of personal experience in the organization have been nothing but positive--nothing like the blackmailing, physically abusive cult portrayed in the film. 'I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?' he said. Travolta then spoke for the only celebrity whose dealings with Scientology get more screen time in Going Clear than his own, Tom Cruise. Scroll down for video . Spoke out: John Travolta on Monday broke his silence on the Scientology-slamming HBO documentary Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief . 'It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom, I imagine,' he said. 'I've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years...that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative.' Those 40 years Travolta has spent as a Scientologist are addressed head-on in the film, which claims that church elders have blackmailed the 61-year-old into being one of their most visible cheerleaders. But Travolta, despite his refusal to sit through the film, said it's merely a showcase for ex-members 'who were disgruntled with their experiences' with Scientology. 'I've been brought through storms that were insurmountable, and (Scientology has) been so beautiful for me, that I can't even imagine attacking it, . 'Why would I even approach a negative perspective? That would be a crime to me, personally, to do that,' he said. Scientologists hold a 'blackmail file' on John Travolta to stop him leaving the faith, which includes 'damaging material' from his sessions with auditors at the church, the doc claims. Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor - once a member of the Church and the point of contact with John Travolta - described a prison camp where members would be forced to work 30-hour shifts, with around three hours of breaks . The film features a number of allegations about how members are threatened and tortured in prison-style camps and cut off from their family if they decide to leave Scientology. Others belonging to the most senior order of the faith have been forced to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in a fight to secure a chair to stay in the church, it was claimed. The claims have been disputed by the Church of Scientology who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as 'admitted' liars and perjurers and 'professional anti-Scientologists.' Directed by Alex Gibney, Going Clear aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including Travolta and Tom. Perhaps the only celebrity discussed more in the film Going Clear is Tom Cruise, whose marriage to Nicole Kidman the doc claims was picked apart by Scientology elders . It included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive

"At first glance, it looks like any other F-16 fighter jet - except for one difference. Boeing's new QF-16 is a actually a retired US Air force jet converted into a drone. The pilotless plane can be controlled from the ground, and will used for target practice by 'top gun' pilots. Scroll down for video . Where's the pilot? Boeing has revealed video footage of an F-16 jet converted into a drone. 126 of the converted planes will be used by the US Air Force as flying targets to train top gun pilots. Length: 49 ft, 5 in. Span: 32 ft, 8 in. Takeoff weight: 37,500 lbs . Max speed: 1,500 mph . Max altitude: 50,000 ft plus . Range: 2,425 mi . Engine: One 27,000-lb-thrust Pratt & Whitney F100 . The first production Boeing QF-16 optionally manned target drone has been delivered to the US Air Force (USAF), Air bosses have revealed. Aircraft QF-007 arrived at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida on 11 March, ahead of being pressed into service by the 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron (ATS). Boeing has delivered six pre-production QF-16s, and in all, the USAF expects to receive 126 QF-16s. The unmanned McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II currently used is no longer truly representative of the air-to-air threats USAF pilots are likely to encounter on future operations. The QF-16 will be able to represent threats in the class of the MiG-29 'Fulcrum' and Sukhoi Su-27 'Flanker', bosses say. In tests, two U.S. Air Force test pilots in a ground control station at Tydall remotely flew the QF-16, which is a retired F-16 jet modified to be an aerial target. While in the air, the QF-16 mission included a series of simulated maneuvers, reaching supersonic speeds, returning to base and landing, all without a pilot in the cockpit. 'It was a little different to see it without anyone in it, but it was a great flight all the way around,' said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Ryan Inman, Commander, 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron. 'It's a replication of current, real world situations and aircraft platforms they can shoot as a target. Now we have a 9G capable, highly sustainable aerial target.' For more than 40 years, the F-16 Fighting Falcon has proven itself as the world's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter, serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world. The drones have been adapted from F-16 jets that have been retired by the Air Force. The QF-16 is a retired F-16 (pictured) turned in a remote controlled drone.

"No-fly list: Chris Roberts, a computer security researcher on his way to give a talk about computer security vulnerabilities at a major conference was told he couldn't fly on United Airlines Saturday, due to comments he'd made on Twitter . United Airlines stopped a prominent security researcher from boarding a California-bound flight late Saturday, following a social media post by the researcher days earlier suggesting the airline's onboard systems could be hacked. The researcher, Chris Roberts, attempted to board a United flight from Colorado to San Francisco to speak at a major security conference there this week, but was stopped by the airline's corporate security at the gate. Roberts founded One World Labs, which tries to discover security risks before they are exploited. Roberts had been removed from a United flight on Wednesday by the FBI after landing in Syracuse, New York, and was questioned for four hours after jokingly suggesting on Twitter he could get the oxygen masks on the plane to deploy. Authorities also seized Roberts' laptop and other electronics, although his lawyer says he hasn't seen a search warrant. A lawyer for Roberts said United gave him no detailed explanation on Saturday why he wasn't allowed on the plane, saying instead the airline would be sending Roberts a letter within two weeks stating why they wouldn't let him fly on their aircraft. 'Given Mr. Roberts' claims regarding manipulating aircraft systems, we've decided it's in the best interest of our customers and crew members that he not be allowed to fly United,' airline spokesman Rahsaan Johnson told The Associated Press. 'However, we are confident our flight control systems could not be accessed through techniques he described.' When asked what threat Roberts posed if United's systems couldn't be compromised, Johnson said Sunday: 'We made this decision because Mr. Roberts has made comments about having tampered with aircraft equipment, which is a violation of United policy and something customers and crews shouldn't have to deal with.' Grounded: United made the decision not to allow Roberts to fly on United 'because he had made public statements about having manipulated airfare equipment and aircraft systems'. In this Tweet, Roberts speculates on whether he should give the command to drop a 737's oxygen masks . Hacking: Once onboard, he pondered on Twitter whether he would be able to hack into the flight's onboard computer settings. In a previous Tweet (seen here) he posted pictures containing details of aircraft data . Concern: Roberts was questioned by FBI agents for four hours. All of his computer equipment, including an iPad, a MacBook Pro, several hard drives and several USB memory sticks were confiscated . Johnson said the airline reached Roberts several hours before his flight to tell him he couldn't fly. But a lawyer for Roberts said Sunday that when his client received that call, the caller would only say he or she was from United, and wouldn't give Roberts a name or callback number. When Roberts then tried calling the number back from his phone's caller ID, it rang instead to a resort hotel, and Roberts

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN)Jaquita Gonzales still tries to call her husband on his cellphone. A pair of work shoes still sits outside the front door of their home in Kuala Lumpur waiting to be reclaimed. His uniform still hangs in a cupboard. Twelve months after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished without a trace, Gonzales hasn't given up hope. She can't. Neither can her children, other family members and friends. Not until there is some conclusive evidence on the fate of the airliner -- one way or another. ""Now and then, every once in a while I call his phone and it goes to voicemail,"" she says. ""You never know, he might pick it up, or someone who has them would let them have the phone and you know, the hope is still there."" She's not alone. Families of victims we spoke to hold on to the slimmest belief that MH370, which disappeared barely an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 last year, did not crash and that the 239 passengers and crew on board are alive. ""No evidence means there is still a little bit of hope. We tap into that hope in order to go on day by day,"" says Gonzales. But she lives a life in limbo. Neither able to move on, nor go back. Her comfortable home in the suburbs of Malaysia's capital remains virtually the same since her husband of nearly 30 years, Patrick Gomes, left for work on the evening of March 7 as lead purser on the MH370 red-eye bound for the Chinese capital. The only real sign that time has moved on, amid the family photos and plaques celebrating her husband's work achievements is a newspaper on top of a stack in the living room with the word ""LOST"" splashed across its front page. Gonzales' lifeline, apart from family, is her work. She runs a private school and daycare center for about 70 children and spends about 12 hours a day there. Keeping busy, she says, keeps her sane. But not a day goes by without her thinking of Patrick. ""I can be driving and I just have to pull off the road and weep. Everywhere I go I see Patrick,"" she says. ""In our home, with my children, with our friends. There are so many times around the home when I say Patrick you are supposed to be doing this for me, where are you. He helped me with ironing, with cooking."" Like Gonzales, many other families CNN has spoken to say they live in hope that their loved one are still alive even though it seems now a virtual impossibility. But along with hope and the pain, many families also share a deep anger. Anger at the Malaysian authorities and Malaysia Airlines who, Gonzales says, are ignoring them. Requests for information are unanswered and attempts to talk to key officials are rebuffed, she says. Grace Nathan's mother was on MH370. For almost a year she and her family grieved in private.

"An American teacher has won a $1million prize recognizing educators around the world. Nancie Atwell from Edgecomb, Maine, received the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize from former President Bill Clinton during a presentation ceremony in Dubai on Sunday. The 63-year-old mother-of-one, who began teaching in New York in 1973, was selected over nine other finalists - including three compatriots from the United States. The writing teacher told The Daily Mail Online she plans to celebrate when she returns, but is more interested in getting back to her children at The Center for Teaching and Learning. Scroll down for video . Nancie Atwell from Edgecomb, Maine, received the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize from former President Bill Clinton during a presentation ceremony in Dubai on Sunday . Nancie Atwell holds the prize at the Global Education and Skills Forum (GESF) 2015 in Dubai, alongside His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Dubai (center), President Bill Clinton (left), Honorary Chairman of the Varkey Foundation and Sunny Varke (right)y, Founder of the Varkey Foundation . She revealed she will not be spending any of the prize money on herself, and hopes the check will be sent 'straight to her school' - where her 29-year-old daughter is also a teacher. After accepting the award, she thanked her colleagues and said: 'I love my teaching life - the intellectual, social, and personal challenges of working with young people and the satisfaction of developing methods that transform their lives and give them perspective on the lives of others. I am grateful to the Varkey Foundation for shining a light on teaching as a powerful profession, one of fulfillment, creativity, and lasting worth.' During an interview last week, Atwell said she's 'convinced that teaching language arts is one of the great careers', because it's 'demanding', but also 'meaning-filled' and 'interesting'. Atwell, 63, began teaching in 1973 . She said: 'I get to demonstrate what is possible, teach what is useful, establish conditions that invite engagement, support the hard work of literary reading and writing, and enjoy the kinds of relationships with adolescents that drew me to education in the first place. 'Because my students select the books they read and the subjects they write about, I'm able to help them discover what reading and writing are good for, here and now and in their literate lives to come. 'There is nothing more important than putting the right book in a child's hands at the right time.' Atwell founded the Center for Teaching and Learning in 1990, which uses experimental teaching methods on students in kindergarten through eighth grade.

This is what has emerged from . conversations with Italian and foreign colleagues,' Domenico . Giani told an Italian police magazine when asked if threats from Islamic State militants were . credible. '(But) at the moment I can say that we are not aware of any . plan to attack the Vatican or the Holy Father,' he added in the . interview, published on the magazine's website on Monday. Giani has a force of some 130 agents protecting most of the Vatican and the Pope, with the help of the more ceremonial Swiss Guard. The Italian police guard the exterior, as well as St. Peter's Square. Twenty of his agents, Giani explained, have specialist anti-terror training and guard the Pope when he's abroad. He told Polizia Moderna: 'Twenty Vatican bodyguards have received special training that makes them suitable also ready to use in anti-terrorist actions. Some of them accompany the Pope during his international travels.' The security operation at the Vatican is aided by a command and control centre that Giani says has a 'high level' of technology, along with thousands of surveillance cameras.

The Swiss Guard are largely ceremonial, but do offer another layer of security at the Vatican . The threat from 'lone wolf' operators are considered by his security team as particularly dangerous because they're 'unpredictable'. They are also aware that some people may try and carry out an act of violence at the Vatican because it would guarantee them maximum media coverage. What makes their job more challenging is that the Holy Father is not willing to abandon speaking to his followers directly during visits. Giani said: 'The Holy Father is not abandoning the style of his pontificate... he does not want to lose touch with his flock. Therefore, we... have to adjust to him, and

"Steve Cotterill could be just a week away from putting Bristol City back into the Championship. The 50-year-old needs just two more wins to achieve the fourth promotion of a career that has been mostly spent rescuing clubs from relegation after goals by Kieran Agard, Joe Bryan and Aaron Wilbraham clinched a local derby victory. In front of a sold-out Ashton Gate, City took revenge for a bitterly fought 1-0 defeat back in November which ended their unbeaten start to the season. Bristol City's Aaron Wilbraham (left) tussles for the ball with Swindon Town's Yaser Kasim (right) Swindon Town's Michael Smith (left) shields the ball from the challenge of the oncoming Luke Ayling (right) Bristol City (4-4-2): Fielding, Ayling, Flint, Williams, Tavernier, Smith, Pack, Freeman (Wagstaff 93), Bryan, Agard (Emmanuel-Thomas 86), Wilbraham (Elliott 94) Subs not used: Saville, Richards, Cunningham, Osborne .

Booked: Turnbull, Kasim . Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire) Attendance: 12,302 . That finished with Swindon chairman Lee Power accusing Cotterill of 'lacking class'. But it was the City boss who had the last laugh with a victory that left Swindon boss Mark Cooper having to pick his side up from two 3-0 defeats in four days that have finished their last hope of automatic promotion. Just to add to their woes they had both Yaser Kasim and Raphael Branco booked, meaning both will now serve suspensions. City had actually needed to ride their luck for much of the first half, with goalkeeper Frank Fielding pulling off three saves in two frantic minutes at one point. And Swindon striker Andy Williams cost Cooper's side their best chance of going in front when he cashed in on a mistake by Aden Flint to go through. He should have squared the ball back to strike partner Michael Smith who couldn' t have missed but instead tried to go it alone and gave Fielding the chance to save. Bristol City striker Kieran Agard (centre) celebrates giving his side the 1-0 lead against Swindon Town . Ben Gladwin (left) brings the ball for Swindon as Bristol City's Joe Bryan (centre) gives chace in midfield . As if that miss wasn't frustrating enough for the visitors, they were then architects of their own downfall when City took the lead on 35 minutes. Yaser Kasim was put under pressure as Swindon tried to play the ball out from the back from a goal kick, and gave it away to Joe Bryan. The young wing back hit a perfect pass to send Agard clear to make no mistake with his 11th goal of the season. City had earned that goal for the way they worked to put pressure on defenders, and they made their own luck again when Derrick Williams stretched to divert Ben Gladwin's shot onto the underside of the bar.

"It's every interviewer's worst nightmare. Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence. Which is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past. After questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life . In the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room. The American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' The horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat . But Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning.

"England head coach Peter Moores, who should surely be sacked after the World Cup humiliation against Bangladesh, is doubly fortunate at the timing of this rock-bottom moment for English cricket. Firstly, the new regime at the England Cricket Board are concentrating on a big restructuring of the organisation, to the extent that axing the beleaguered Moores was said not to be even on the agenda — or wasn’t last week. Secondly, Aussie Jason Gillespie, who would be hot favourite to replace Moores, is not sure he wants the role. Gillespie has five children — with four under the age of 10 — and the county championship-winning Yorkshire coach has promised wife Anna he will put the family first. England coach Peter Moores (left) said he is 'desperate' to continue after his side's poor World Cup campaign . Gillespie said: ‘My eldest daughter Sapphire lives at home in Australia with her mum and I didn’t see her grow up as I was on the road playing for Australia. I made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t do the same again. The children are my priority, family come first.’ And Gillespie, who worked very successfully with England number two Paul Farbrace at a Yorkshire bankrolled by new ECB chairman Colin Graves, added: ‘It would be a really big ask to go away 9-10 months a year. I would find that really difficult. I’d find that a challenge.’ Phil Neville (left, with Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino) will work on his FA Pro-license this week . Phil Neville and Brentford manager Mark Warburton are part of a select group of 24 coaches working on their FA Pro-Licence at St George’s Park this week - at a time when the FA of Wales are promoting their ‘world class’ alternative course which has Thierry Henry, Les Ferdinand and Tim Sherwood signed up. However, the FA still regard their coaching badges as the gold standard and will react to the Welsh competition by putting on two Pro-licence courses a year in future rather than one. But there will be no reduction in the extra hours involved in completing the SGP course — 500 as compared to 350 in Wales — that the FA believe gives their set-up the edge. Grand National winning jockey Carl Llewellyn’s ghastly n-word comment on a racing preview panel on the eve of last year’s Cheltenham festival seems to have been airbrushed out of insular racing’s memory one year on. Not only was Llewellyn, who was fined and interviewed under police caution, included in exactly the same line-up for the annual tipping evening at famous racing pub the Hollow Bottom on Monday night, but the sport’s promotional arm Great British Racing have assistant trainer Llewellyn featured riding Champion Hurdle horse the New One on one of their main Cheltenham preview videos on their official website.

"George Osborne dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country's top earners . Labour and Tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the Chancellor's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the Government's priorities. George Osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country's top earners, offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than £50,000 could see the rate lowered. Instead he says the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax-free personal allowance bracket from £10,000 to £12,500. Raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least £50,000 was also a priority, he said. At present anyone earning between £31,866 to £150,000 is taxed at the higher rate. Those earning above £150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent. But Labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket. Accusing the current Government of prioritising 'helping the very richest', Shadow chief secretary Chris Leslie condemned the Chancellor's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries. When pressed in an interview with Sky News the Chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for Britain's top earners, instead saying the issue was 'not a priority'. 'If that was our priority or our plan we would have made it part of our plan and made it one of our priorities. Scroll down for video . 'That's not our plan. Judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions are better off,' he said. 'And when it comes to higher rate taxpayers our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate, the 40p rate, to £50,000.' 'Those are our big tax commitments for the coming parliament.' The Chancellor added that any deal between Labour and SNP would harm the country, claiming the latter's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was 'much stronger' than the opposition leader . He also refused to commit to devoting 2 per cent of the budget to defence, the limit agreed by NATO members. David Cameron has faced repeated calls to commit to spending 2 per cent of the budget on defence . 'We made a commitment at Nato. We are spending it today.

"Cape Verde's 2-0 win over Portugal was the most eye-catching international result of the week. So, who are Cape Verde and why has this tiny island off the west coast of Africa suddenly become an international football force? Where are the Cape Verde Islands? Cape Verde is a group of islands 400 miles from Senegal off the west coast of Africa. Its population is around 500,000 and boasts both beautiful beaches and striking volcanic landscapes, making it a haven for tourism . Cape Verde is a picturesque island off the African coast with a population of just 500,000 people . Does it have any footballing tradition? More than you think. Manchester United winger Nani is from Cape Verde and could have played for them instead of Portugal. Celtic and Sweden legend Henrik Larsson's mum is from Cape Verde. Being a former Portuguese colony, most people support the big Lisbon clubs Benfica and Sporting, you see the club's scarves and banners hanging from cafes and bars . Sporting Lisbon ace Nani (centre) is from Cape Verde but decided to represent Portugal at national team level . Former Barcelona star Henrik Larsson could have played for Cape Verde as his mother was born on the island . Why the sudden success? Like a lot of African countries including Algeria and Ghana, Cape Verde decided to start recruiting players who grew up in Europe, mostly Portugal in their case, but were eligible for them through family ties. Around a quarter of the Cape Verde squad are European, although 14 of the 19 players used in Portugal were born on the island. They qualified for their first Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and reached the quarter-finals, and qualified again this year. They are the smallest nation ever to play in the continental finals. Cape Verde were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of their first ever Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 . Who are the star players? Every member of the squad plays club football outside Cape Verde, mostly in Europe and particularly Portugal. Striker Heldon plays for Sporting Lisbon and midfield set-piece specialist Babanco is with Estoril. Odair Fortes, who scored their second goal against the Portuguese, plays in French football for Reims. Other members of the squad ply their trade from Romania, Angola, Cyprus, Hungary, Holland, Bulgaria and Mexico . Sporting Lisbon striker Heldon, currently on loan at Cordoba, is one of Cape Verde's key players . What can Cape Verde offer visitors? Firstly, sunshine. The temperatures rarely dip below 21 degrees Celsius (70 F) even in the December and January winger months. The name of the main beach Boa Vista (beautiful view) says it all. It is beginning to become a big tourist destination, just a six-hour flight from the UK. Visitors are encouraged to sample the excellent local fish and admire the spectacular dunes and volcanic mountains. Boa Vista beach, pictured, is one of the main attractions on the small island of Cape Verde . Are they a flash-in-the-pan? The FIFA rankings would suggest not. Cape Verde currently stand 38th in

"(CNN)Richard Dysart, the award-winning stage actor who gained fame playing law firm leader Leland McKenzie on ""L.A. Law,"" has died. He was 86. He died of cancer at his home in Santa Monica, California, according to his wife, Kathryn Jacobi Dysart. For decades, Dysart was a noted TV and film character actor, and stage star, winning a Drama Desk award for playing coach in Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, ""That Championship Season."" But it was as McKenzie, the occasionally crusty paterfamilias on ""L.A. Law,"" that he's likely best remembered. 'L.A. Law': Sex, crime and the 'Venus Butterfly' McKenzie usually took a back seat to the younger, more glamorous characters on ""Law,"" a Steven Bochco-created legal show that owed much to his previous hit, ""Hill Street Blues."" The employees of McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak included Harry Hamlin's smooth-talking Michael Kuzak, Corbin Bernsen's skirt-chasing divorce attorney Arnie Becker and Michele Greene's idealistic Abby Perkins. There was as much time devoted to bedroom activities as there was legal issues while the show bravely took on such topics as AIDS, child molestation and capital punishment. But McKenzie was the one who kept them in check while still encouraging their better instincts. (Alan Rachins' Douglas Brackman was the business guy.) He was also involved in one of the show's most surprising plot twists: a romantic affair with a rival, Rosalind Shays (Diana Muldaur), who met with one of TV's most shocking deaths -- plunging down an elevator shaft. Dysart appeared in every episode of the show, which ran from 1986 to 1994. After ""L.A. Law"" ended, Dysart took few roles, though he did return for an ""L.A. Law"" reunion movie in 2002. Dysart's other credits include 1971's ""The Hospital,"" 1975's ""The Day of the Locust,"" 1979's ""Being There,"" John Carpenter's 1982 version of ""The Thing,"" 1985's ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" and 1987's ""Mask."" He is survived by Jacobi Dysart, his wife of nearly three decades, a son and two grandchildren. CNN's Rachel Wells contributed to this story.

"(CNN)There can be no March without the madness. When it comes to college basketball, the first month of spring ushers in a frantic slew of games to determine seedings for one of the most fervently watched sporting events in the U.S., known simply as the NCAA Tournament, or more often, March Madness. Like English soccer's FA Cup, much of the 68-team tournament's appeal is its egalitarian system of pitting traditional powerhouse programs like Duke, UCLA and Kentucky against relative minnows like Saint Mary's, Butler and Davidson. And both competitions offer the carrot of being able to impress scouts from top pro teams -- a first-round NBA pick can expect to earn anywhere from $755,000 to $5.75 million. Not bad for a graduate. Last year's tournament reached 102 million viewers, while almost 740,000 fans attended the 36 sessions. ""When you go to college, maybe your number one goal before you graduate is you want to be able to play in the NCAA tournament,"" says Bryce Drew, head coach and former player at Valparaiso University in Indiana (28-5, Horizon League champions). ""It's the biggest stage for college basketball, and it's one of the biggest national events in all of America."" Drew knows just how big an impact that high-profile stage can have on aspiring professionals from beyond the major college ranks. His last-second shot for Valparaiso to beat the University of Mississippi in the first round of the 1998 tournament is one of the most replayed moments in March Madness history. How it works: . Selection Sunday (March 15) A 10-member panel determines seedings for the 68 teams that make the knockout tournament . First Four (March 17-18) A format started in 2011, 8 teams compete to qualify in the main draw .

'This particular incident we had no other choice,' Evans said about the fatal shooting.

During a press conference, Evans said the video shows that the officers did not have their weapons drawn or have their hands their hands on their weapons when they approached West's car. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said it was important to release the video to show the community exactly what happened - and why. 'In those instances in which video evidence can inform the public... it is in everyone's best interest to share that information as soon as possible,' Conley said during the press conference. The district attorney said such transparency was necessary to 'tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not to inform'. 'Our goal going forward is to ensure that we are one people and one city,' he said. Evans said Moynihan had seen the video. Angelo West was fatally shot by Moynihan's colleagues during the shoot-out.

"When Nic Newling recalls his childhood, he remembers misleading highs and deep depressions where the only option he could see for himself was committing suicide. But it was the unexpected and tragic death of his teenage brother, Christopher, who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Now, the 28-year-old is using his story of loss and confusion - in which he moved between doctors and psychiatric wards and was fed various concoctions of prescriptive medication before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - to raise awareness of mental illness. Mental health advocate Nic Newling struggled through the confusing highs and depressing lows of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder between the ages of 13 and 18 . It was the unexpected and tragic death of his older, teenage brother Christopher (pictured right with Nic left), who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective . Academically driven from a young age, Nic said that the time he was eight years old, he had planned his whole life out in his mind with the intention of becoming a vet. 'I got into a high school with a scholarship; at that point I was really happy for the first six months, but I pushed myself too hard and put an unrealistic amount of pressure on myself and just crashed. What it looked like was not having any other interests, being snappy and grumpy and angry - which are all things that are not like me at all,' he told Daily Mail Australia. His bad moods progressed into forms of anxiety and depression and what Nic described as an 'overwhelming sadness that didn't come from any particular place', before taking on a level of psychosis. 'When things first started getting bad, I was experiencing symptoms of agitation, panic attacks, I was withdrawing from friends and life and not finding pleasure in the things that I used to find pleasurable, I was experiencing what I thought was OCD behaviors and I started thinking I was hearing things that weren't real,' he said. Both Nic (left) and Christopher (centre, with eldest brother Ben right) suffered from mental health problems at the same time . Unlike Nic (left), Christopher (with Ben right) was not as open about his emotions and his anxiety and depression. His death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on Nic's struggles . 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. 'I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room.' By year eight, Nic had admitted himself into a psychiatric ward - a move that marked the beginning of years of confusions and various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy - in a desperate bid to rid himself

But they also leap to the physician's defense in the piece, saying that his on-air 'Ozisms' should not cancel out his stellar work at the university, where he has an unblemished record as a doctor. The eight staff wrote the op-ed for USA Today after 10 doctors urged Columbia to sever all ties with Oz, who serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at the College of Physicians. Those doctors accused him of being a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments' on his syndicated talk show - accusations Dr Oz has vehemently fought this week. Scroll down for videos .

The 79th Masters attracted massive ratings in the USA and there is no surprise in that. They tuned in to watch as perfect a demonstration of sporting endeavour as you will ever behold. But they also tuned in to watch a man with a common touch and a depth of sincerity that reached into the heart of every household. Politicians who try so hard to be popular could learn much from 21-year-old Masters champion Jordan Spieth.

Spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. And then he remembered his father’s words: ‘Make sure you say thank you to the people, son.’ So he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. With this victory, Spieth must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner. You will not find a single pro on the PGA Tour with a bad word to say about him. There is nothing fake about Jordan Spieth. Texans are supposed to be brash and larger than life, right? This one makes jokes about his receding hairline and dislikes being asked why he comes across as humble because, well, that would not be humble. Listen to Phil Mickelson, the Masters specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at Augusta only once before. ‘He’s just a class guy in every way and it’s difficult not to root for him,’ said the leftie.

Doting: Mother-of-one Candice Campbell, 25 (pictured left and right with partner Geoffrey Burns), choked to death on her own vomit after eating a Kinder Bueno before falling asleep on the sofa, an inquest has heard . Her husband-to-be Geoffrey Burns, who had also fallen asleep, woke up to find his partner's lifeless body slumped onto his knee. Despite him desperately giving CPR to Miss Campbell, she could not be saved. Miss Campbell, who did not drink alcohol, had been taking a variety of prescribed medication to ease abdominal pain which she had suffered after giving birth in October 2013. At an inquest into her death, Mr Burns told the hearing how he had warned Miss Campbell not to eat the bar, incase she fell asleep. He told how the pair had both fallen asleep while watching a film, but that he had woken up around 5.30am to find Miss Campbell unresponsive. He said: 'Candice was eating a stick of Kinder Bueno and I told her not to eat chocolate in case she fell asleep because her medication makes her drowsy. I was worried that she may fall asleep eating it. 'I must have been tired because I fell asleep. I woke up to the dogs barking and Candice's head was on my lap. The first thing I remember saying to her was, ""Wake up, let's go upstairs"". 'I noticed her lips were blue and there was a white foam coming from her nose and food particles at her mouth.' Mr Burns said when he realised she was not responsive, he began CPR. An inquest heard how Miss Campbell was watching a film with her partner at their home in Hull when the pair both drifted off to sleep. Mr Burns told the inquest that he had warned her not to eat the bar (pictured) He said: 'I gave her mouth to mouth and pressed down on her chest as I was taught at first aid. 'I continued to scoop out food from her mouth and I saw there was the Kinder Bueno she was eating before I fell asleep. 'I tried to resuscitate her. I blew twice into her mouth and did 32 compressions.' The inquest heard how Mr Burns then ran 12 doors down the street to Miss Campbell's parents' house to get help. Her father, Ian Gibson, also attempted CPR before they called for an ambulance. Dr Ian Scott, consultant neuropathologist at the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham, carried out the post-mortem examination. He said toxicology tests revealed Miss Campbell had taken several different drugs, including diazepam, tramadol, pregabalin and 'possibly' dihydrocodeine.

"Jailed: Vicky Marks stole £4,200 from vulnerable Joan Groucher while pretending to care for her . A carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90-year-old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her PIN written in her diary. Vicky Marks left her frail victim Joan Groucher 'heartbroken' by abusing her trust to plunder £4,200 from her bank account over a seven-month period. The victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in Croydon, south London and move into sheltered accommodation. Marks, 59, visited Mrs Groucher twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash, using the code written in the elderly woman's diary. She even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital, Croydon Crown Court heard. Sentencing Marks to 12 months in jail, Recorder Silas Reid told her: 'The victim was in her nineties, had problems with dementia, and, effectively, you inveigled your way into her family.' He added: 'It's still unclear to me why you would do that to someone of that age, why you would cause her that much pain, which, in the end, wasn't really for that much money. 'But time and time again you took her card and took money from her account. It seems almost every time you went to her house you would have taken money.' Mrs Groucher, who has four children and eight grand-children, had lived at the same house for around 30 years, but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care. 'One of the features of this case which is disturbing is that she had to leave her home,' Mr Reid said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Groucher said: 'I know Vicky does not have a mother, but that is no reason to do what she did. 'You were trusted by me and I'm heartbroken. It's disgusting what Vicky did to me. It worries me she could have done it to other people.' Paul Fairley, prosecuting, told the court that Mrs Groucher paid Marks £10 every time she visited. The thief's deception was found out when Mrs Groucher's daughter Caroline Baldwin, 70, saw that there was money missing from her bank account in July last year. Hearing: Croydon Crown Court (above) heard Marks even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital . 'She noticed there was £2,000, or £3,000 less than what there should have been,' Mr Fairley said. Mrs Baldwin then took a closer look at her mother's bank statement and noticed 'a pattern of sums of £100 and £200 withdrawn over a significant period of time', he added. She notified the police who checked CCTV footage from the Lloyd's Bank branch in Croydon and identified Marks withdrawing £100 from the victim's account the previous day. Marks, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was arrested and pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing. Speaking outside court today, Mrs Baldwin said her family was 'elated' by the jail

"Love the lighting in these photography shots? They become even more awe-inspiring at the realisation that they're paintings, and someone spent between 50 to 300 hours painstakingly creating them. Patrick Kramer is a 33-year-old artist hailing from Springville, Utah, who specialises in remarkably hyper-realistic paintings. Scroll down for video . Action shot: The artwork of 33-year-old Patrick Kramer is so realistic it's impossible to tell apart from a photo. In this image, he has painted a falling woman with a deeply intricate background . The US artist specialises in beautifully in-depth oil painted portraits, including this intricate black and white portrait of a man called Matt . The paintings, including this of a sleeping young girl called Anna, take the artist up to 50 to 300 hours to complete . It's almost impossible to tell that Kramer's flawless creations are in fact oil paintings due to their incredible pin-sharp detail and clarity. His portrayals vary between vivid city scenes, still-life objects, portraits and breathtaking motion-shots. As well as his portfolio of hyper-realistic paintings, he also constructs more surreal variations on still life, involving insects or inanimate objects in front of a background. One of his images is an imitation of the cover art for musician Drake's 2013 album, Nothing Was the Same. Kramer also paints highly-detailed urban shots, which are impossible to tell apart from a photo . His technique involves building layers of oil paint in order to achieve the intense level of detail . The US artist works from photos and builds up delicate layers of oil paint on a board or canvas. This allows him to add controlled detail and subtle shadowing, which appear almost three-dimensional in the pieces of artwork. Kramer has admitted that an oil painting can take anywhere between 50 to 300 hours (one to six weeks) to complete. The length of time taken depends entirely on the size of the painting and the level of detail. The 33-year-old artist has admitted that this type of artwork suits his precise preferences and personality. Kramer also constructs more surreal imagery of insects, which all still have the same high level of detail - including (left) a dragonfly on an intricate background, and (right) Kramer's painting of a butterfly resting on a wad of letters . Cracks in the surface: The artist, from Utah, specialises in creating exceptionally-realistic works of art. In this case, it is a paintbrush against a background of cracked paint . Kramer said: 'Being a perfectionist, I have always been considering art as an outlet for my slightly obsessive personality. The artist's background and education was also important in honing his interests. 'I studied painting in college, and experimented with hyper realism as a way of perfecting my craft. 'I never intended to pursue the style, but found it hard to give up, as it suited my nature.' Kramer's artwork - including this painting of half-filled glasses - is astounding in its level of clarity . Glass half full or half empty? This painting is incredibly detailed, from the fine fish fins to the

"A 'perfectionist' straight A student who was stressed about her studies was killed by a speeding train, a coroner heard today. Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school, an inquest into her death was told. Miss Nigam would stay up late studying, resulting in sleep deprivation and a negative impact on her performance at school - which caused further depression and anxiety. Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford heard the teenager, who had been a volunteer at the London Olympics in 2012, was also worried about her appearance. An inquest heard Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school. Stock photo . Tragically, she had first told her parents she was feeling suicidal in 2013 and had even said she would stand in front of a fast train on a Tuesday to take her life - which is how she ultimately died. Miss Nigam had seen a number of doctors over several years, but her father Ankush Nigam told the inquest that she had often refused treatment. He explained that he felt he was 'torturing' his daughter by making her attend appointments - and eventually accepted that she would one day take her life. On February last year, the teenager was struck by a train travelling from London Paddington to Hereford at Twyford railway station in Berkshire. In a statement to the court, train driver Stephen Wood said he saw a pair of legs running into his view from the right as he approached the station. Mr Wood said: 'I saw a person turn towards me and spread their arms wide apart. The train struck this person.' The driver had applied the emergency brake and paramedics were called to the scene, but Miss Nigam, from Lower Earley, Berkshire, died instantly from multiple injuries. Mr Nigam said: 'I'm glad she's in a peaceful place.' He said his daughter first started showing signs of depression and sleep deprivation at 13 and had been on various medication since.

"A mother-of-four whose addiction to Red Bull saw her drinking 24 cans of a day claims she has been cured of her habit by hypnosis. Sarah Weatherill, 31, became so dependent on the energy drink she was told if she cut down too quickly she could suffer a seizure as her body was so used to the caffeine. The law student spent a staggering £5,460 every year on the popular energy drink since she became hooked in 2009. Scroll down for video . Sarah Weatherill, 31, was so addicted to Red Bull she drank 24 cans a day leaving her lethargic, depressed, suffering heart palpitations and constantly anxious . Her habit was at its worst the following year when she was studying for a law degree and wanted to stay awake to revise for exams. She soon became dependent on the drink and couldn't get out of bed unless she knew she had some in the fridge. She also became lethargic, depressed, had heart palpitations and was constantly feeling anxious as her £105-a-week habit spiralled out of control. She finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the Red Bull was severely damaging her health. And after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month, she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50-minute session. Her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains: . 80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso. 27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar. 10g Taurine (an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance). B vitamins. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half the potentially lethal dose. Ms Weatherill, from Coventry, said: 'I was studying for a Higher National Certificate in law in 2005 and used to have the odd Red Bull for a pick me up. 'It is hard to say when it became every day but I remember that by 2009 I was definitely hooked. 'Whenever I felt tired having a Red Bull would be the first thing I would do.

"The first people to be affected by Qantas’s newly enforced 'smart casual' dress code have taken to social media to complain after being turned away from the airline’s lounges for wearing thongs. Qantas warned back in February that it would begin strictly enforcing its business class lounge dress code from April 1 - but not everyone got the memo. Cassandra Hann‎ wrote on Qantas’s Facebook wall on Thursday: ‘Thanks Qantas club Perth for refusing me entry because I was wearing Havianas (I am going on holidays after all).’ Ms Hann fumed: ‘I had just got off a long flight from Sydney to Perth with a tired 15 year old and 3 year old and had to wait at Perth airport for 3 hours for our connecting flight to Learmouth.

If you want to take hundreds of dollars of membership fees off us every year you could at least have sent members a letter or an email informing us of dress regulation changes. Poor effort Qantas.

'I particularly love the cap sleeves and on-trend sheer lace neckline, perfect for a vintage-style wedding day.’ Last night a spokesman for F&F at Tesco said the dress was made to cater for brides on a budget. He said: ‘The Bridal range is an extension of F&F’s Occasion wear offer which over the seasons the brand has seen positive sales reactions too. 'F&F aims to provide affordable yet stylish pieces for brides and guests a like. Every bride wants to look gorgeous on their wedding day, with the F&F wedding dress this is made possible but on a budget. 'With wedding costs soring, we want to ensure customers are still able to experience an aspirational quality of dress at a very affordable price.'

"The Liberal Democrats have admitted they are on course to lose at least 20 MPs, but claim this could still be enough to put them back in power. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed. But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Eastleigh in Hampshire . Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet

"Children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky, plastic Fisher-Price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes. The popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell. But for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters. The child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground . At least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. It is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time. A large amount of research, according to Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors. This graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter . The latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green. Researchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters. They then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990. The results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set. Among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent. The colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row) Red bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent . Synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. Some people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell

"Out there in celebrity land, in the mink-lined nurseries of the filthy rich, a new breed of fearsomely spoilt children are being raised by their fearsomely spoilt parents. These indulged tots are hatched into a world where budgets have no bounds and reality is a misty blur on the ever-golden horizon. Look at them. They are in furs before they are five, Chanel before six and in bed by seven. And while dressed in the finest of clothes, they eat in the best restaurants, are entertained like emperors and hot-housed in luxury that would make a sultan blush. Meanwhile, the gruesome irony of being given designer shoes before they can walk and expensive birthday parties before they can talk seems to be lost on their crazed, doting, cash-scattering parents. Scroll down for video . First birthday bling: Tama Ecclestone's little girl Sophia . Thank goodness the tots always have a gem-encrusted rattle to hand, perhaps to shake at the folly of it all. Take Tamara Ecclestone. You can always depend on Tams to raise the pamper bar to hitherto unheard of heights of deluxe lunacy — and this week she did not let us down. The 30-year-old daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone and her husband, Jay Rutland, have just returned from a holiday in Italy to celebrate his birthday. Before their next holiday, they had the small matter of celebrating daughter Sophia’s first birthday this week — and Tamara was determined it was an event that would never be forgotten. Not by Sophia, who is too young to have a coherent thought running through her gorgeous little head. But by everyone else who goggled at the £70,000 or so spent on turning the front courtyard of their London home into Sophia’s very own petting zoo, complete with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra. A rather glum-looking zebra, to be honest, but in terms of competitive party-throwing, the little critter certainly earned his stripes. There was also a real live princess, complete with a wimple, and a platoon of security men delivering gift-wrapped presents for the lucky baby. In pride of place was a rather garish gazebo made entirely of pink balloons with Sophia’s initials picked out in white. As well as a petting zoo with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra, Sophie was also lucky enough to have a decadent princess palace created out of pink and white balloons . If you have ever wondered what a doctor would see while performing liver surgery on Mr Blobby, wonder no more. Tamara also posted photographs on social media of Sophia enjoying her birthday breakfast in her couture pyjamas, surrounded by giant soft toys and a whispering forest of helium balloons. Another gift, wrapped with a pink velvet ribbon, awaited her perusal on her high chair tray. What and who was all this lavish fuss for? Certainly not for the child, who would have been as puzzled as the zebra about what was going on. However, events like this somehow seem to be more about making an affluent statement than

"Barack Obama did not call Kanye West at home - despite the rapper's claims to the contrary- but a presidential staffer did ring to set up a future chat, sources have claimed. The back-and-forth began a couple of weeks ago, when Kanye boasted about his close relationship with the most powerful man in the world during a speech at Oxford University. Kanye, who is married to Kim Kardashian, claimed that Mr Obama would call him at home, and he would call Obama 'out of the blue'. Scroll down for video . Kanye West (left) has admitted Barack Obama (right) did not call him at home – but a source close to rapper claims a presidential staffer did set up a future chat . 'Obama calls the home phone by the way,' he added. Last week, Mr Obama was forced to deny the claims during an appearance on chat show Jimmy Kimmel Live, saying he didn't even have Kanye's home number. When asked about Kanye's claims about their friendship, he replied: 'I met Kanye twice. 'The first time was when I was a senator and he was with his mom and he had just gotten big… And then about six months ago he came to an event. I love his music.' President Barack Obama had dismissed the claims he called rapper West at home during at appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live (pictured) 'I don't think I've got his home number.' But Kanye refused to back down, and made the bizarre assertion again when questioned by a TMZ reporter at LAX Airport. After the Kimmel interview was aired, Kanye told reporters at LAX Airport 'I love Obama, he called our house before' Despite Mr Obama's flat-out denial, the outspoken rapper still insisted that he would contact him at home. 'I love Obama, he called our house before,' he claimed. 'He knows that, don't try and pit us against each other.' Now the truth appears to have finally been revealed after sources close Kanye said a presidential staffer had contacted the West home to set up a potential future chat with Mr Obama. A source told TMZ that the president had attended a celebrity- filled breakfast in Beverly Hills last October where he spoke about using star power to get people to vote. When it was over Mr Obama told guests including Kim and Kanye he wanted to set up a call to continue the conversation. Afew days later, a staffer reportedly called to follow up. The president has praised Kanye's music but has previously labelled the singer a 'jackass' after his 2009 MTV Video Music Awards antics during Taylor Swift's acceptance speech.

"Mountain bikers and cross-country runners are at risk from the deadly stomach bug E.coli if they get splashed with mud, doctors warned today. Medics at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary say they treated a 23-year-old cyclist for an E.coli 0157 infection after he was admitted to the hospital suffering from vomiting, abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. The man - a vegetarian - said he had not eaten undercooked meat or vegetables, nor had he spent time with livestock or visiting farms before falling ill. A man was treated for E. coli which doctors believe he contracted after taking part in a Tough Mudder event and was splashed with infected mud (file picture) But eight days before his symptoms began the man had competed in a cycling event along wet, muddy tracks in eastern Scotland. He, along with other competitors, had removed the mudguards from his bicycle to reduce weight, and mud and water had splashed on his face during the race. It is thought this was how he became infected with the bug, which can be found in animal faeces and farm slurry. The man said he had taken part in a 'Tough Mudder' event, which involves a 10 -12 mile race with obstacles such as climbing vertical walls and plunging through ice pools. The cyclist, who has not been identified, recovered - but the doctors have highlighted his case in the Journal of Infection Prevention. Writing in the research paper, the doctors warned: 'Sporting endeavours such as cycling and cross-country running events often take participants through such high-risk areas and may be an important cause of contact with E. coli 0157. 'This case highlights such exposure and should alert clinicians to the possibility of E.coli 0157 infection and the importance of individuals presenting with bloody diarrhoea with a history of participation in similar sporting or other events.' Escherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness. Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk. The incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is usually 3-4 days, but it's possible for symptoms to take longer to appear (up to two weeks). Source: NHS Choices . Dr Robert Laing, consultant physician in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and co-author of the journal article, said: 'We know that E.coli 0157 survives well in cattle faeces. 'This case highlights the possible risk to participants in sports that expose them to mud that may have been contaminated by animal faeces. 'Splashes to the face are likely to be particularly hazardous and efforts should be made to protect yourself from these as far as possible.' E.coli 0157, which lives in the gut of animals, is usually associated with food poisoning or drinking contaminated water. Scotland has a particularly high incidence of the strain, with more than twice as many cases than other parts of the UK. In 2012, three people

"Saddened: Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have 'furious' about the release of That Which Does Not Kill Us, the fourth book in the Millennium series . Stieg Larsson's partner has hit out at plans to release a fourth installment in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series more than a decade after the journalist's death - dismissing it as nothing more than a money-making scheme. Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have 'furious' about the release of That Which Does Not Kill Us, which will hit the shelves in August to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of the hugely successful Girl with a Dragon Tattoo. Gabrielsson - the left wing journalist's partner of more than three decades - has not only questioned the motivation of the publishing house, but been hugely critical of the author chosen to follow in her late partner's footsteps. David Lagercrantz, a journalist and author best known as footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic's official biographer, is 'a completely idiotic choice' in her view. 'They say heroes are supposed to live forever. That's a load of c***, this is about money,' she said. 'It's about a publishing house that needs money, (and) a writer who doesn't have anything to write so he copies someone else.' Larsson had, in fact, begun work on a fourth book centering on protagonists Lisbeth Salander, a feisty rebel hacker-turned-detective, and Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter, before his untimely death in 2004. Aged just 50, he suffered a heart attack as he walked the seven storeys to his office, where he worked as a journalist and editor of anti-fascist magazine Expo. The books were published posthumously, so Larsson never saw how successful the books were to become: so far, they have sold more than 75million copies in more than 30 languages, according to publisher Norstedts. However, Gabrielsson, 61, has dismissed any idea he had an overarching plan for the novels - a theory which has been used to justify the publication of this latest 500 page tome. She also revealed Lagercrantz had not seen the fourth manuscript, and 'started over from zero'. 'Everyone thinks there was some grand scheme but no, he had no plan for the first three books and when he started writing the fourth one, it was spontaneous. He still didn't have a plan,' she said. If it were up to her, none of this would have happened. 'I wouldn't have continued Stieg's work. It was his language, his unique narrative.' Furious?: Stieg Larsson - who died in 2004, before his trilogy became successful - had started work on the next book, but David Lagercrantz, who has picked up the baton, has started from scratch with his version . Gabrielsson says she views Lagercrantz is 'a completely idiotic choice' to continue Larsson's work, with even the 'very literary' title sitting badly with her. She said: '[He] comes from a completely different background. Everything has always been easy for him. He's never been an activist. Everything is wrong.'

"In these fantastic images you can see Mars and its moons, an amazing nebula and even the surface of a mysterious world covered in water. Or can you? These might look like pictures of space at first, but they’re actually just shots of glasses of water and food in a photocopier. The amazing photography trick was performed by 34-year-old freelance photographer Navid Baraty from New York. New York photographer Navid Baraty has created fictional images of space using ingredients found in the kitchen. Shown is a 'spiral galaxy', made with baking soda, curry powder, chalk, salt, sugar and cinnamon . The project follows an imaginary spacecraft called Wander - Wormhole-Accelerated Nomad Delivering Reconnaissance - which you can follow on Instagram, Facebook or his website. In the images he used common kitchen ingredients to make the cosmic images. - Glass containing water and food colouring . - Salt, cinnamon, baking powder . - Cat fur, cumin, tumeric . - Coffee, corn starch, butter . He told MailOnline that the images were made by placing objects on an Epson photo scanner and then doing a scan with the lid open. He then partially filled glasses with liquids and put food colouring in them in order to create shapes and swirls.

"A 20-year-old mother accused of beating her two-year-old son to death last year and then burying his body in a shallow grave has given birth to another baby while in custody. Meagan Work, from Austin, Texas, gave birth to a son in February, Fox7 reported, but it is not known if she gave birth in jail or at the hospital, or if she was permitted to spend time with him. Child Protective Services took the child into state custody and on Monday, a hearing was held to determine if he will stay in foster care or live with a family member, KVUE reported. Officials told the channel that State District Judge Darlene Byrne will likely make a decision in upcoming days where to place the baby boy. In custody: Meagan Work, pictured left in a mug shot, gave birth to a baby boy while in custody last month, five months after she was arrested in the death of her two-year-old son Colton, pictured right . The baby's father is believed to be Michael Brandt Turner, who is also charged in the death of Work's two-year-old son, Colton Brandt Turner. Michael Turner was not Colton's biological father. Work was four months pregnant when she was arrested in her son's death last September after his remains were found hidden in a wooded area. A friend who was concerned about the boy's whereabouts had contacted authorities. Following the call, investigators interviewed Turner at San Saba County Jail, where he was being held on unrelated offenses. A day later, Turner took them to the site where he admitted burying the body in July. A witness told police that he had seen Work slam her son's head against a truck before shaking and slapping him on July 7. Work, who had been living out of her car or with friends in the months before the death, told police different stories about her son's whereabouts, including that he had been kidnapped from their car and that she had given him to a couple she met in a restaurant. Killed: Colton's body was found in a shallow grave in a wooded area last September. His mother, pictured, had different accounts of what had happened to him but eventually admitted he had died in a motel room . Abuse: Relatives posted pictures of bruises and scratches across his body before he died. CPS had two open complaints against his mother when he died but because she was homeless, they could not find her . She eventually told investigators he died in motel room, according to an arrest affidavit. After his death, it emerged that relatives had shared photos of his injured body on Facebook, including deep scratches and bruises to his head and back. Texas Child Protective Services had received four total complaints beginning when Colton was about six months old, KVUE reported at the time. Accused: Work's boyfriend Michael Turner, 29, led authorities to the boy's buried body last year . Two of the complaints had been resolved and the other two were open and ongoing when investigators discovered

"He's famous for being really, really ridiculously good looking but Britain's answer to Zoolander, insists he's nothing like the airheaded movie character. In fact, there's far more to top male model David Gandy, 35, than posing in pants - he's going into business as a shoe brand owner. And competition with fellow Essex boy, David Beckham, drives him every step of the way, he revealed in a new interview with Red Magazine. Britain's top male model David Gandy doesn't want to be seen as a 'brainless idiot' any more . David recently bought luxury footwear brand David Preston in a bid to be taken seriously. He said: 'Models are as popular as bankers! You're seen as a brainless idiot – paid a fortune to do very little. I don't want to just be known as the man in the pants.' Yet he jokes that whatever he chooses to do, Becks follows soon after. 'Well, I did the white pants in 2006, and then he did Armani. I became an ambassador for whisky, and now he has his whisky brand,' he said. 'I don't think we're in competition, though, and hopefully people should be proud there are two Essex guys taking on the world, promoting Britishness.' As an ambitious entrepreneur, Gandy is determined to revitalise homegrown businesses and concerns. David Gandy delivers his best blue steel in a new shoot - and shows off the shoes made by his new luxury footwear brand David Preston . David Gandy jokes that he's in competition with another David - fellow Essex boy Becks . The April issue of Red is out today . He said: 'We're terrible at investing in our own companies. It upsets me that half the companies on Savile Row aren't British-owned. 'When I see a small British company I believe in, I'm in the privileged position to give it a chance. London is an extraordinary place to be, and we should be proud of our great brands. 'I'm proud to have stuck here. I belong to England.' And while pop idols such as Harry Styles and Justin Bieber may have most girls' attention, David, who's reunited with Saturdays singer Mollie King, is proud to be seen as a grown man. 'We've become so obsessed by boys. There's almost a backlash against true men. Where are the Paul Newmans or Steve McQueens of the world?' The muscled adonis recently showcased his enviable physique in his range of underwear for M&S, but he offers words of comfort to the average man. 'Of course [I have fat days!] I work hard at it. At the gym there are people with all the gear and no idea, and then people in scruffy tracksuit bottoms working hard. That's me at the end of the day.'

"An investigation into the shark meat sold at fish and chips stores has found the majority of retailers are mislabelling their produce. Eleven of the 23 Melbourne fish and chips shops examined by Greenpeace were found to be selling the overfished school shark despite advertising it as the sustainable gummy shark or 'flake' - a term that is only meant to be used for gummy shark or New Zealand's similar rig shark. Less than half of the stores, which had samples of their raw fillets DNA tested by the University of Canberra in September last year, were found to be accurately labelling their 'fish'. Greenpeace has investigated the shark species used by 23 Melbourne fish and chips shops as part of their campaig for restaurants to reveal the origin and type of their seafood . One of the restaurants labelling their fillets as gummy shark was found to be serving rig shark while another which was advertising flake was unable to be identified. 'Aussies are being sold 'fake' and chips, not flake and chips because of Australia's shoddy labelling laws,' campaigner Nathaniel Pelle said. 'Australians are being kept in the dark about where their seafood comes from, the type of fish they are eating, and how it reached their plate.' The results have formed part of the campaigning organisation's argument for the federal government to improve Australia's food labelling laws, demanding that they include a requirement for restaurants and take-away stores to declare the country of origin of their food. Eleven of the 23 Melbourne fish and chips shops examined by Greenpeace were found to be selling the overfished school shark (pictured) despite advertising it as gummy shark or flake . Greenpeace claims that current legislation does not require them to identify the fish type or origin. Its research further suggests that at least 80 per cent of the squid and octopus sold in Australia is caught overseas from overfished origins while two thirds of the popular fish type barramundi is brought in from Asia. Great concern has also been placed on the fate of many 'orange roughy' fish, which despite being managed through conservation efforts in Australia, is often sold under different names at various restaurants. Less than half of the stores, which had their raw fish DNA tested by the University of Canberra in September last year, were found to be accurately labelling their 'fish' as gummy shark (pictured) or flake . 'It is not possible for consumers to make an informed decision under these conditions — a situation that may result in negative environmental and health outcomes,' Ms Pelle said. 'Australians deserve labelling laws that tell us what fish we're eating, where it was caught and how it was caught.' To find out more about Greenpeace's Label My Fish campaign, visit labelmyfish.com.

"Dinner with Arnold Palmer on Thursday night clearly agreed with World No 1 Rory McIlroy. All those indifferent rounds in Florida so far this year were swept aside on Friday as the Northern Irishman notched up five birdies in a row at one point on his way to a superb 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. It was the first time in eight rounds in the Sunshine State this year that he had broken 70 and what a way to do it. From out of the pack, the 25 year old is now bang in contention for a morale-boosting victory in his last scheduled start before his attempt to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters next month. Rory McIlroy hit a second round of 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Friday . It was the first time in eight rounds in Florida this year that the World No 1 had broken 70 . McIlroy looks to have played himself back into form ahead of the Masters next month . ‘I’m just feeling more comfortable day by day, and it was great to see a few putts finally drop,’ said McIlroy, whose performance drew a glowing tribute from his good friend and playing partner, Rickie Fowler. ‘After what I saw today and the fact he’s clearly the best player in the world, he has to be the favourite for the Masters,’ said the American, who was pipped at the post to both The Open and USPGA Championships last year by McIlroy. ‘That course suits his game. He didn’t start out hot today but when he gets it going as he did on the back nine, it’s hard to hang with him. If he continues to play like that, he will be ready for Augusta, for sure.’ Fowler was right when he said nothing appeared to be happening for McIlroy over his front nine, the inward half on the course. In fact, he’d played much better on the first day, when he opened with a 70. But after finally getting a putt to drop at the second, and enjoying a small stroke of fortune at the third, where his pulled drive carried a water hazard by just a couple of yards, it all started to click. A good wedge to the third green set up a birdie and then came his third in a row at the par five fourth. At the fifth his wedge shot finished 18 inches away and then came another birdie at the long sixth, where he got up and down from a greenside bunker. ‘It’s a lovely feeling when you get on runs like that and the game suddenly feels very easy,’ he said. Fowler's good friend and playing partner Rickie Fowler admitted McIlroy is now favourite for the Masters . McIlroy had five birdies in a row in Dubai earlier this year but this was the first time he had enjoyed such a run in an event on the PGA Tour, and it electrified the huge galleries at Bay Hill. By this stage he had

"Los Angeles (CNN)Gov. Jerry Brown unveiled an emergency $1 billion spending plan Thursday to tackle the state's historic drought. A staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for California to recover from the emergency. Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León said the legislation will include two bills that will speed up contracting funds to ""manage the drought and strengthen our infrastructure."" According to the California State Water Resources Control Board, the package will specifically accelerate $128 million from the governor's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities. Proposition 1 funding, which enacted the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, will funnel $272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure. Some $660 million from Prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas. As part of the changes, Brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as California enters the fourth year of a worsening-water crisis. ""This unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up,"" said Brown. ""But we have a lot of good policies coming."" To exacerbate matters, weather conditions are continuing to diminish natural resources. The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which Californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs, is at a near record low. The March snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow, just 5% of the March 3 historical average for the measurement site. The overall water content for the Northern Sierra snowpack came in at 4.4 inches, just 16% of average for the date. Central and southern Sierra readings were 5.5 inches (20% of average) and 5 inches (22% of average) respectively. Only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower. ""The drought isn't letting up, so we can't let up either,"" Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins said. ""This legislation will deliver relief to Californians harmed by the drought and help us manage the significant problems the drought continues to cause. Since our skies are still clear, our job is too. And making sure we meet emergency needs, prepare for short term problems and advance longer-term projects are an important part of that effort."" Brown anticipates his emergency package to move into action immediately. He has recently created a Drought Task Force to expedite the legislation.

"(CNN)Italian fashion designer Stefano Gabbana and Elton John are in a war of words on social media, calling for boycotts of each other's work. The argument stems from comments about in-vitro fertilization in Panorama magazine, in which Gabbana and longtime collaborator Domenico Dolce spoke about ""synthetic"" children born from ""rented"" wombs. ""No chemical children: life has a natural course, there are things that shouldn't be modified,"" the magazine says in a quote attributed to both designers. The magazine also promises insights from the designers on ""the importance of relationships within conventional families with very, very traditional values"" in an interview that hit Italian newsstands last week. John, who has two children with husband David Furnish through IVF, issued a strong repudiation of the statements on Sunday and pledged to boycott the Dolce & Gabbana fashion line. In response, Gabbana defended his ""freedom to speak"" and called on fans to boycott John. Sir Elton appears to be winning the social media war with the hashtag #BoycottDolceGabbana, which by Monday morning had been used more than 35,000 times on Twitter since John invoked it on Sunday. By comparison, Gabbana's #boycotteltonjohn has been used just 1,600 times on Twitter, according to social media search tool Topsy. ""How dare you refer to my beautiful children as 'synthetic'. And shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at IVF - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfill their dream of having children,"" John said Sunday on Instagram. ""Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again."" The sentiment quickly gathered support from such celebrities as Ricky Martin, Al Roker and Courtney Love. Tennis star Martina Navratilova tweeted her support for John's post, saying ""My D&G shirts are going in the bin — don't want ANYONE to wear them."" Parents and IVF advocates also joined the boycott. ""My son is NOT synthetic. His life was made possible through #IVF & I couldn't be more grateful,"" writer and infertility advocate Jenn Palumbo said in a tweet. The comments from Dolce and Gabbana struck some as hypocritical coming from a couple that was romantically involved until 2005 (they continued working together after the breakup). Still, Gabbana has dropped hints in interviews of his ""traditional"" views toward family structure. He told an Italian publication in 2006 that he once asked a female friend to be a surrogate mother because he was ""opposed to the idea of a child growing up with two gay parents."" Gabbana was quick to react to this controversy, calling John a ""fascist"" in an Instagram comment that was later deleted, according to CNN affiliate TGCom24. He also sought to discredit reports that they told Panorama in this instance they objected to same-sex adoption, even though Gabbana took that position in his 2006 interview.

"A former special education high school teacher who admitted to having sex with five underage male students has been sentenced to three years in state prison. Summer Michelle Hansen, 32, of California entered a guilty plea in February to 16 felony counts related to the sex acts which included seven counts of oral copulation of a minor, six counts of statutory rape and three counts of distributing pornographic material to a child, according to NBC. The mother of three was told during the sentencing on Friday that she must also register as a sex offender for life. Parents of the victims were upset that Hansen's plea agreement was approved, which was made directly to Riverside County Superior Court Judge Becky Dugan. If she had been convicted at trial, Hansen would have faced 13 years in prison. Scroll down for video . Summer Michelle Hansen (above in court during her sentencing on Friday), 32, was sentenced on Friday to three years in state prison and must also register as a sex offender for life . Parents of the victims were disappointed that the judge approved Hansen's plea agreement, as she could have faced 13 years in prison if convicted at trial . Hansen entered a guilty plea in February to the 16 felony counts related to sex acts with her five male students . Judge Dugan said she took into consideration factors such as the former teacher's admittance of guilt and lack of prior criminal history when deciding on an appropriate sentence. In court on Friday, the judge told Hansen: 'You're a mother yourself. It's beyond me to understand your behavior.' Deputy District Attorney Kimberly Williams said that her office opposed the length of the sentence proposed by the judge but that she was happy to see Hansen take responsibility for her actions, according to the Press Enterprise. Hansen made an emotional plea to the victims' families while in court saying she prayed for them every night and that she was 'heartbroken', according to KTLA. 'I'm not a monster. I made bad choices in life and for that I'm truly, truly sorry,' Hansen said through tears. The ex-teacher came under investigation two years ago after a former student at Centennial High School came forward to say he had sex with Hansen, and she was arrested in June 2013. Prosecutors said the crimes took place in her classroom, a school utility room, her car and at one victim's home between May 2012 and 2013, according to KTLA. It is not believed that the students were taught by her at the time but all were under the age of 18. Hansen, (left and right) was a special education instructor at Centennial High School. She was officially terminated on Friday by the Corona-Norco Unified School District . In court Hansen made an emotional plea to the victims' parents and said: 'I'm not a monster.

"Murdered preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani (above) was killed by a hitman who climbed into the back of his car, it emerged last night . Murdered preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani was killed by a hitman who climbed into the back of his car, it emerged last night. The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work. But when the imam arrived, the killer got into the rear seat of his Volkswagen Passat and shot him several times. The murder at 11.15am on Tuesday bears all the hallmarks of a professional assassination because the gunman was thought to have used a silencer and it took place away from CCTV cameras. Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers are investigating whether Mr Arwani, a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, was murdered on the orders of the regime. They suspect the part-time builder was tricked into driving to Wembley to quote for a job – but the killer was put off when the imam took his teenage son along and claimed he could not find the keys to the house. He is thought to have been executed when the mystery client – described as having an African accent – asked Mr Arwani to return a second time alone. Shortly after the shooting Mr Arwani's car was discovered 'perfectly parked' on the side of the road with the engine still running and with one of the windows wound down. The father-of-six from Acton, west London, had links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group outlawed in Syria and other countries in the Middle East. He is understood to have been a member of the organisation until about seven years ago, but retained ties to some of the group's senior figures. The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work. Above, two men stand outside the An Noor mosque in Acton, west London, which is near to where Mr Arwani was shot dead on Tuesday . Police cordoned off the murder scene. It is thought that when the imam arrived, the killer got into his Volkswagen Passat . Mr Arwani was a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who is pictured above in September 2013 . Mr Arwani fled Syria in 1982 after a massacre in his home city of Hama carried out on the orders of Assad's father, Hafez. The imam, who moved to Britain in the mid-1990s after studying Islamic law in Jordan, claimed he was sentenced to death in his absence by the Syrian regime. He was involved in violent anti-Assad demonstrations outside the Syrian Embassy in London three years ago. Police were forced to use riot shields to beat back protesters after they broke through barriers, and six people were arrested. Mr Arwani told reporters during the demonstration: 'This building belongs to the Syrian people, not a regime killing people every single day for ten months.' Detectives are also considering whether the father of six was killed by

"A petty feud between the two most powerful women in Ed Miliband’s inner circle has rocked the Labour Party. The dispute between the party’s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell – who is tipped as a future Labour leader – to attend the Brits ‘pre-party’ where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.’ The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the ‘second jobs’ debate was partly the responsibility of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London’s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co’ at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics – as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party’s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November. A Labour MP said: ‘Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics. ‘We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.’ A Labour spokesman said last night: ‘There is no truth in this allegation.’

"Tragic: Paul Millgate killed himself by jumping from a window at his Bournemouth University accommodation block . A jilted student sent his ex-girlfriend a picture of himself with a noose around his neck before leaping out of a window to his death - and police had to stop people from taking photos of his body, an inquest heard. Paul Millgate, a Bournemouth University psychology student, jumped out of the window of his accommodation block after falling into despair when his 16-month relationship ended. Suicide notes were found in the student's room and he had previously asked fellow residents if he should kill himself. Mr Millgate, 20, of Crowborough, East Sussex, died of devastating multiple injuries from the fall - just days after breaking up with Aleasha Istead. Before his death, he messaged Ms Istead saying 'my life is not worth living' before sending pictures taken from the window that he jumped from. He had started drinking heavily in the days leading up to his death and leapt from the building while flatmates were having a party in another room. Witnesses said his body was visible from many of the 400 flats in the halls of residence. The windows in the building are designed to only open at a tilt. But an inquest at Bournemouth Coroner's Court heard that the window's lock had been over-ridden by a previous resident who bought a special key from the internet to open it fully. Coroner Mr Payne reached a verdict of suicide. He said: 'It is my conclusion that he did deliberately take himself out of the window and sadly ended up on the ground below having jumped from the 10th floor. 'This could never have been a cry for help. He must have realised that by jumping out of there, there was only one result and that would have been his death.' A police officer who responded to the incident spoke of her shock at having to try to stop university students taking photos, the inquest heard. PC Emily Rowberry said she was confronted by lots of students looking out of their windows taking photos and videos of the 20-year-old's body and expressed fears they would appear on social media before his family were informed of his death. In a statement read out at the inquest, PC Rowberry said: 'He was pronounced dead at 00.28am. Window tampered with: An inquest heard that the window's lock (appartment block pictured, left) had been over-ridden by a previous resident who bought a special key from the internet to open it fully . 'The location was very prominent. I was concerned for the onlookers' wellbeing and the casualty's dignity. I could see a lot of people were watching from their windows. 'I shouted for people to move away from the windows and close their curtains. I was shocked to see cameras flashing as people then took pictures and video. 'I was worried pictures might appear on social media before we had time to inform the family so I shouted again for people to go inside.' Mr Millgate had been

"It seems like an idyllic smattering, with nothing more to worry about than sun, sea, sand and where the next cocktail is coming from. But one organisation is asking tourists to investigate before heading to the exclusive holiday destination to ensure they are not visiting a resort associated with human rights abuses. Known for pristine beaches and crystal clear water, the Maldives has recently come under scrutiny after the country's former president, Mohammad Nasheed, was found guilty of terrorism charges earlier this year. Ethical Maldives Alliance is encouraging tourists to boycott 'high risk' resorts linked to human rights abuses . Now, the Ethical Maldives Alliance is encouraging tourists to consider the instability in the region when booking their accommodation. The Alliance has crafted a list of over 100 well-known hotels and is urging visitors to consult the guide before travelling. Although very little detail is provided when it comes to the Alliance's rationale for dubbing certain resorts to be 'high risk,' it has colour-coded the hotels into three categories. Those to be avoided are labelled red, those coded as green are considered to be 'low risk' and orange hued businesses are 'under consideration.' 'While okay to visit in the short term, there is a possibility that they will be on the 'to avoid' list in the longer term,' the website reads. 'Therefore, early reservations for visits later in the year should be avoided.' The group claims that the 'red' or 'orange' resorts are directly or indirectly linked to human rights abuses. Hotels are coded as 'low risk,' 'high risk, or 'under consideration' depending on their ties to corruption . By boycotting, the alliance hopes that tourists will help to make a difference in protecting and promoting democracy, while not adversely effecting the Maldivian economy. 'With a long and sad history of corruption, political oppression and human rights abuses, Maldives' first attempts at democratic reform are now faltering,' a statement on the Alliance's website reads. Crime is reportedly on the rise as a result of support for 'extreme gangs,' which are supported by police to suppress any dissent. 'Uncontrolled corruption starting at the very top of all branches of government filters down through all levels of society, making life very difficult for the average Maldivian.' Though most resorts are categorised as 'low risk,' Conrad Maldives Rangali Island is listed as one to avoid . While most resorts are categorised as 'low risk,' several top name hotels have been included on the Alliance's list of those to avoid. Among them, the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island. 'Ethical Maldives evaluates resorts and other businesses on ethics-based criteria,' the website reads. 'These include owners' support for governments that perpetuate corruption, intimidation and oppression, measures relevant to the environment and social responsibility.' In response to allegations presented by The Ethical Maldives Association, the High Commission of the Maldives told MailOnline Travel: 'Resorts appear to be categorised not on the basis of any practices in their resorts, but on the basis of alleged links of their owners to the Government of the Maldives.

"Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms and that the implementing of a Rooney Rule could help raise awareness of the issue. Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, has been vocal on racism in football in the past and supports John Barnes’s assertion that black managers find it difficult to get another job after being sacked. ‘Just because I’m sitting here I’m not going to change my views of many years,’ said Ramsey, who takes his side to West Brom in search of a much-needed three points on Saturday. Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms . Ramsey believes that the implementing of a Rooney Rule could help raise awareness of the 'covert' issue . John Barnes’ view that black managers find it hard to get a job after being sacked was backed up by Ramsey . ‘The fact we’re still, at this stage of the game, highlighting that I’m the only black Premier League manager shows that it’s not the norm to have people from ethnic minorities in this position. ‘So until this becomes normal, and it’s not highlighted in such a spectacular fashion, racism will be prominent. ‘Obviously, I’m in a very fortunate position to be the manager of QPR but I hope people won’t look at that as a token gesture. I think I’ve earned my stripes to be in this position. Barnes' last managerial job was at Tranmere in 2009. He lasted four months before being sacked . Ramsey is operating as the only black manager in the Premier League as he looks to keep QPR up . Ramsey was without a job for seven months after leaving his coaching role at Tottenham last season . ‘I think that there are other people who are probably more talented or better suited, from a profile point of view, as many white managers who have got jobs based on their profile and playing experience.’ The 52-year-old manager thinks that discrimination isn’t exclusive to race and that the Rooney Rule — which obliges America’s NFL teams to interview minority candidates for top jobs — might be the solution here. ‘If it doesn’t work out for me here, I think that, as any manager of any race, I think you’re always in a position where it’s difficult to get another job,’ he said. QPR travel to face West Bromwich Albion after disappointingly losing at home to Everton last time out . Aaron Lennon is congratulated by his team-mates at Loftus Road as the QPR players head for the half-way line . ‘As a black man, I think it’s always going to be difficult anyway. I think the Rooney Rule is an important factor as there’s an awareness that something has to be done to affect the way people think in boardrooms. ‘I’m not just talking about race, I’m talking about gender, homophobia and other issues. I think there needs to be more awareness of factors that affect why people get jobs or not.’

"It was only fitting that a former Hearts man should help to finally send the Championship title to Tynecastle. After all, this entire season deserves to be coloured maroon. Yet it was not only a favour to his first love that Lee Wallace performed at Easter Road. In scoring the crucial, confidence-building opening goal for Rangers, he also delivered an immensely valuable prize to his current employers. For the Ibrox side, games against Hibernian this term have been akin to a sadistically extended form of torture. Three successive defeats had delivered a crushing 9-1 aggregate. One more on Sunday and it was an historic clean sweep. It would also have delayed Hearts’ inevitable coronation for at least another six days. Lee Wallace (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after giving Rangers the lead away to Hibernian . Hibernian XI: Oxley, Gray (Watson - 45), Hanlon, Fontaine.

Goals: Wallace 44, Miller 80 . Booked: Murdoch, Miller . Wallace, though, had different ideas. Freed to attack almost at will in a new 3-5-2 formation set up by Stuart McCall, he delivered a barnstorming display on the left flank. After speaking so openly on Friday about how this had been a season of professional and personal torment, here was an emphatic reminder of just how forceful a player he can be. Others in blue followed his lead. Kenny Miller scored a highly controversial clincher ten minutes from the end — when refereeing headline-magnet Willie Collum ignored Hibs’ claims for a foul by Wallace — but, in truth, this was a victory that had foundations laid long before kick-off. So often in recent times, Rangers fans have lamented the perceived lack of tactical thinking from those resident in the technical area. McCall, though, turned up in Leith and did a number on Hibs to secure the first triumph of his three-match reign. It did not go unnoticed. Kenny Miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for Rangers and close the gap on Hibernian . ‘Stuart McCall’s blue-and-white army’ was the chant from the visiting support as the minutes ticked down. McCall’s hopes of remaining in situ beyond the end of the season may well hinge on winning promotion. If that is to become a reality, then he will need many more days like this one. Overall, this was just a second win in 10 games for Rangers but it lifted them to within three points of their hosts, with a game in hand. They now have renewed hope of finishing second and reducing their play-off schedule in the fight to follow Hearts up.

"A report has been reportedly been released that hints at a hostile workplace for women in the Victorian Liberal Party. The internal report is believed to show that some women have been asked inappropriate questions about their marital status and had been discouraged from seeking leadership positions.

Victorian Liberal MP Inga Peulich claims she was bullied by members of her own party . Upper House Mary Wooldridge admits that the the party has lost female voters which is perhaps due to the inappropriate treatment of women during the preselection process and also workplace bullying . The internal Liberal Party report apparently found that, during preselection, only female candidates were asked questions about their family and personal life. The report outlines the Liberal Party's unprofessional questions toward women about their personal lives during the preselection process . 'How were they going to balance family and political life?' and 'Who would cook the meals?' were some of the questions asked according to the report. It also mentioned a number of occasions that 'involved party members in limited areas engaging in intimidation, threatening and bullying behaviours towards female party members and members of Parliament,' The Age reported. The report made 14 recommendations, including stepping up general participation of women and increasing the number of females in the party. Upper house Mary Wooldridge reportedly noted that the Liberal party has lost female voters. 'We've gone from a party where women clearly vote for us, to one where they clearly do not,' she said. The internal report also suggested that a women's network be created to boost morale and allow Liberal women to connect to each other and questioned the need for spouses to be included in the preselection process. Opposition leader Matthew Guy (right) has called for more women to join parliament in a bid to modernise . There are currently only six women in the Victorian Parliament's lower house. Opposition leader Matthew Guy has called for more women to join parliament as he believes the party needs to reform in order to win back the government from Labor. 'I've made a point in saying to this party that we need more women in our team,' he said. 'We need to modernise... The community must see themselves reflected in us.'

"The new Republican governor of Illinois has said New Jersey is 'going down the drain' - despite it being run by fellow Republican Chris Christie, who sent $7million his way in the latest election campaign. Bruce Rauner said the Garden State was 'lost', thanks in part to its high property taxes. Rauner hit out at New Jersey, which has had Christie as governor since 2010, during a speech at the Illinois Farm Bureau last week. Sniping: Bruce Rauner, right, has said that New Jersey, the state run by his ally Chris Christie, left, is 'a disaster' because of its tax regime . Rauner's backer: Christie's Republican Governors Association gave $7million to Rauner's campaign in the 2014 governor elections . He said: 'We've got the highest property taxes in America other than New Jersey. I don't want to compete with New Jersey on anything, especially that. That's a disaster.' The State Register-Journal of Springfield, Illinois, reported that he continued: 'New Jersey is lost. They're going down the drain, and they ain't turning it around.' The staunch criticism may come as a surprise to Christie, who as the head of the Republican Governors Association funneled $7million in campaign funds to help him topple Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn. Christie often showed up on the campaign trail alongside Rauner, and boasted that he 'didn't come empty-handed' after making a $2.5million top-up to the coffers. He's behind you: Rauner, left, stands behind Christie during a Chicago fundraiser in which the two ate jumbo hotdogs . CBS Chicago reported how during the campaign Rauner and Christie made a public appearance to order jumbo hotdogs together before a hotel fundraiser. In return, Rauner has often been a vocal Christie fan. NJ.com reports that he has described him as 'one of the greatest public servants in America today' and 'a superstar'. Rauner spent a total of $37million on TV ads alone in the campaign, in which he outspent Quinn by some $9million, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The Center's records from the 2014 governor elections show Christie's association sent a total of $7million Rauner's way. Spokesmen for Christie and Rauner have yet to comment.

"The Pentagon said Tuesday it would exhume and try to identify the remains of nearly 400 sailors and Marines killed when the USS Oklahoma sank in the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The ship capsized after being hit by nine torpedoes during the December 7, 1941 surprise attack from Japanese forces. Altogether, 429 sailors and Marines onboard were killed. Only 35 were identified in the years immediately after. Hundreds were buried as unknowns at cemeteries in Hawaii. In 1950, they were reburied as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific - also known as the Punchbowl - inside a volcanic crater in Honolulu. Scroll down for video . Casualties: The Pentagon announced Tuesday plans to exhume the bodies of some 400 sailors and Marines who were killed on the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941, in the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor. Above, the ship seen capsized after the attack . Resting place: The sailors and Marines who died on board the USS Oklahoma are currently buried as unknowns in Honolulu's National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific . Nameless: Above, a gravestone at Honolulu's National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, marking the resting place of seven unknown Americans who died on board the USS Oklahoma . The military is acting now, nearly 75 years after the men died, because advances in forensic science and technology as well as genealogical help from family members have made it possible to identify more remains, said Lt. Col. Melinda Morgan, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency spokeswoman. The move is apparently a part of a new Pentagon policy on disinterring the remains of unknown troops. According to the new policy, bodies may be exhumed from Punchbowl or any other permanent American military cemeteries - but they can not be removed from any U.S. Navy vessel that is being used as a national memorial, like the USS Arizona which remains sunk and on display in Honolulu. The bodies of Marines and sailors lost at sea do not apply to this new effort. In order to disinter these large groups, researchers must also prove that they can identify at least 60 per cent of the group with supplied family DNA samples, medical and dental records. 'The secretary of defense and I will work tirelessly to ensure your loved one's remains will be recovered, identified, and returned to you as expeditiously as possible, and we will do so with dignity, respect and care,' Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work said in a statement. 'While not all families will receive an individual identification, we will strive to provide resolution to as many families as possible.' Officials plan to begin the work in three to six weeks, Morgan said. They aim to identify the remains of up to 388 servicemen within five years. In 2003, the military disinterred one casket at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific based on information provided by Ray Emory, a Pearl Harbor survivor who has spent years doggedly scouring documents.

"Quick-thinking: Brady Olson, a teacher at North Thurston High, took down a gunman on Monday . A Washington high school teacher is being hailed a hero for tackling a 16-year-old student to the ground after he opened fire on Monday morning. No one was injured after the boy shot twice toward the ceiling in the school commons before classes began at North Thurston High School in Lacey, about 60 miles southwest of Seattle, authorities said. Brady Olson, who teaches Advanced Placement government and civics at the school, knocked the armed student to the ground and kept him pinned down until authorities arrived, witnesses said. The shooter is in custody at the Lacey Police Station. The teenager, who has not been identified, only transferred to the high school a month ago, according to authorities. He later told police he shot into the air because he didn't want to hurt anyone. A search warrant is being carried out at his home, police said. School district spokesperson Courtney Schrieve confirmed that the 43-year-old teacher had been responsible for helping apprehend the student. 'He is a very brave man who probably saved a lot of people today,' Schrieve told KCPQ. Both students and staff said they were not surprised that Olson, who has taught at the school for nine years, was the one to stop the shooter. 'If anyone in the school were to do something like he did, I would think it would be him,' said student Teia Patan, 17, who is in one of Olson's classes. 'He's one of those people who watch over kids.' Scene: A 16-year-old student walked into the commons, pictured, on Monday with a gun and cigarette and fired two shots at the ceiling, according to witnesses. Mr Olson then tackled the boy to the ground . Fears: Parents and students walk away from North Thurston High School on Monday after a 16-year-old student opened fire before classes at the school and was stopped by a teacher . Patan was swept into a classroom and then escorted out of the building after the shooting. He described his high school as a nice, calm school, with no bullying. 'When it was happening, I first thought it has to be fake,' he added. Another student, 16-year-old Anthony Rybalkin, told the News Tribune that he was in the commons area when the shots were fired. 'I saw (the student) walking down the stairs with a cigarette and gun in his hand,' Rybalkin said. 'I was like, ""This is actually happening"".' He watched as Olson tackled the boy to the ground. He said that another teacher then helped him hold the teenager down. Olson, who is married to an elementary teacher in the school district, Shara Olson, has been teaching for nearly 20 years and has also worked as a former assistant football coach.

"Solitary: Steve Fuller has worked as the winter caretaker of Yellowstone National Park since 1973 . Steve Fuller has lived in New York, San Francisco and London, but the place he decided to settle down is about the opposite of any booming metropolis. For the past 42 years, Fuller has worked as the caretaker of Yellowstone National Park, protecting the park's buildings during the long and brutal winter months. He lives in a small cabin alone during the winter, with enough food stored up since his closest neighbors are a two-hour snowmobile ride away. It sounds like the premise of Stephen King's thriller The Shining, but Fuller claims he's never felt lonely or the least bit antsy cooped up alone in his cabin. 'Never had cabin fever. Never been bored,' the 70-something outdoorsman told CBS. That's because there's plenty of work to keep Fuller busy. Winter preparation starts in November, when he works with a crew to board up his share of the parks about 100 buildings. Then, once everyone is gone, he waits for the snow to come - and it never disappoints. Yellowstone averages about 150 inches of snowfall a year and Fuller has to stop it from accumulating on the roofs of the park's buildings, which can collapse under the weight of the snow. Over the years, Fuller has developed a system which takes some of the hassle out of shoveling the roofs. Instead, he uses a saw to cut the snow into blocks which he then pushes off the roof with the help of gravity. Fuller has been doing the job since 1973, when he was the only applicant and the pay was just $13.24 a day. Over the years, Fuller's responsibilities have grown and now he is one of the only Yellowstone staffers who work at the park year round. Scroll down for video . Content: In the winter, Fuller stays behind to take care of his section of the park. But he says he never gets lonely . Tough work: During the day, Fuller works to keep about 100 buildings free from snow, since they can collapse under the several feet that accumulate every year. He has developed a method of sawing the snow into blocks and pushing them off the roof, which makes the job a little easier . The cold months: The winter care-taking job starts at the beginning of November and ends whenever plows can reach the park. Above a group of bison seen in a snow-covered Yellowstone field .

"Leeds striker Steve Morison admits he has never experienced anything like the current circus surrounding the SkyBet Championship side. Six players - Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri, Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani - withdrew from the squad on the eve of Saturday's trip to Charlton citing injuries, and this is just the latest incident in another turbulent period at Elland Road. A 'freakish set of events' was how beleaguered boss Neil Redfearn described the sextet's absence after the game but Morison, who scored Leeds' goal in the 2-1 defeat at The Valley, told BBC West Yorkshire Sport: 'We're around it every day. Leeds United striker Steve Morison (centre) admits he is surprised by the chaos at Elland Road at the moment . Giuseppe Bellusci and three other Italians were among those who withdrew form the Leeds squad . Souleymane Doukara was another player that withdrew as part of the latest drama at Elland Road . 'People draw their own conclusions over what happened (with the withdrawals). It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.' When asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened. 'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit. 'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.' Former Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club. Italian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. According to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday. But Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road. 'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek. 'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.

"Union barons handed Ed Miliband more than £1.6million in the first week of the election campaign – treble the donations received by the Tories. Figures released by the Electoral Commission revealed that Labour received £1.9million in the week to April 5, with 84 per cent coming from just three trade unions. It included a £1million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour’s reliance on the union’s militant boss Len McCluskey. Ed Miliband received £1.6m from union barons in the first week of the election campaign, figures have revealed . Conservative donations totalled just over £500,000 in the first week of the campaign, with about a quarter coming from donors with links to hedge funds. Critics have accused Labour of being bound by its union paymasters after the party unveiled policies including raising corporation tax, introducing a mansion tax, repealing the benefits cap, nationalising the railways and scrapping employment tribunal fees. Since Mr Miliband became party leader, thanks largely to union backing, nearly £7 in every £10 donated to Labour has come from the unions – amounting to more than £40million. In the first round of election donations registered, £506,240 was given by Unison, while the CWU gave £51,072. Labour received a £1million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour’s reliance on the union’s militant boss Len McCluskey (pictured) The party did attract one large business donation, from property tycoon Sir David Garrard. The former tax exile, who was involved in the cash-for-honours controversy, gave £250,000. Ukip received only £35,416 in the period but last night its coffers were boosted by a £1million donation from Daily Express owner Richard Desmond, who gave £300,000 last year. In the week to April 5, the Conservatives received £501,850 and the Lib Dems £20,000. One of the most generous gifts to the Tories – £75,000 – came from Michael Tory, who was in charge of Lehman Brothers’ UK investment banking division when the bank nearly crashed the West’s economy. Sawsan Asfari, wife of long-time Tory donor and oil executive Ayman Asfari, gave £20,000. Syrian-born Mr Asfari, who has given the Tories about £400,000, was made a ‘business ambassador’ by David Cameron last year. Home insurance boss Richard Harpin of Homeserve gave £50,000. His company was fined £30million last year for a mis-selling scandal. Hedge fund manager, James Diner, who once dated model Caprice, gave £25,000 while socialite Fitriani Hay, who co-owns property development firm JMP Group with her racehorse-owning husband James, donated £66,850. Ukip received £25,000 from Robin Birley, who is also bankrolling Tory chief whip Michael Gove’s re-election campaign. Nick Clegg’s friend Anthony Ullmann, boss of polyester yarn company Autofil, and Joseph Zammit-Lucia, who describes himself as a ‘compulsive contrarian’ on his website, each gave £10,000 to the Lib Dems. Tory candidate Henry Smith said: ‘The union fatcats have once again lavished the dosh on Ed Miliband. That’s because they know he’s a weak leader who’ll dance to more than one tune: not only SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon’s, but their’s too. Those tunes mean more spending, more borrowing and Britain back to bankruptcy.’ Conservative donations totalled just over £500,000 in

"A North Carolina father was acquitted of strangling to death his 4-year-old son and trying to kill his other two children after the defense successfully argued that the man's 'violent sleepwalking' was to blame for the tragedy. A jury on Wednesday decided unanimously that Joseph Anthony Mitchell is not guilty of murder and attempted murder after an expert witness said he was effectively unconscious at the time of his attacks four years ago. Jurors had asked Superior Court Judge James Roberson if they could consider a lesser verdict of manslaughter, but the judge said it was all or nothing: murder, or not guilty. Scroll down for video . Breakdown: Christine Perolini, second from left, is comforted by friends and family on Wednesday after her ex-husband, Joseph Anthony Mitchell, is found not guilty of killing their four-year-old son . Sleepwalking defense: Mitchell's attorney argued that his client (left) was not conscious of the night of September 22, 2010, when he strangled to death his 4-year-old son, Blake (right) Desperate cry: Reacting to the verdict, the grieving mother exclaimed in court: 'I failed. I couldn't save him' Devastated: Christine Perolini was so stunned by the ruling that she hyperventilated and had to be wheeled out on a stretcher . Mitchell, 50, sobbed after the shocking verdict, but made no comment as he walked out of court a free man. His ex-wife, Christine Perolini, was so stunned by the ruling that she hyperventilated and had to be wheeled out on a stretcher surrounded by her family. Reacting to the verdict, the grieving mother exclaimed in court: 'I failed. I couldn't save him [Blake].' Mitchell testified that he was in financial distress and had not been sleeping well around the time of 4-year-old Blake Mitchell's death in September 2010. Prosecutors said those financial difficulties drove Mitchell to strangle the toddler and try to kill the others. Mitchell's 13-year-old and 10-year-old children testified in court that they fought him off. But a defense expert said Mitchell's stress and lack of sleep likely resulted in 'non-REM parasomnia,' a sleep disorder whose sufferers can perform random acts unconsciously. Because of this disorder, he was incapable of exercising criminal intent, the expert said. A psychologist who testified for the prosecution after repeatedly interviewing Mitchell said he had no mental condition that would have left him unconscious during the attacks, and that he must have consciously planned them. Mitchell's trial lasted a month but it took the jury less than four hours to return a not guilty verdict. Following Mitchell's acquittal, some members of the jury panel spoke out saying that they did not believe the sleepwalking defense, but their hands were tied. Prosecutors said extreme financial difficulties drove Mitchell to strangle the toddler and try to kill his two older children . Emotional: Mitchell, 50, sobbed after the shocking verdict .

I know he's a great striker, and that it's always difficult to stop him, but we have to do that if we want to go through.' 'We're confident, but we expect a very difficult game. Paris are going to come here to score goals. It'll be a very complicated game. We're ready, and we hope to win in front of our fans. We'll have to see the tactics the coach puts in place. What is certain is that we cannot sit back and wait. 'We have to defend well, but we mustn't go for the 0-0 because if we concede a goal, Paris will qualify by winning 1-0.

"While many tattoos hold a certain symbolism to their bearer, the design chosen by someone getting their first ink at the age of 80 must have an incredibly special meaning. ABC2's new show, Tattoo Tales, follows the journey of some of the customers of Bondi Ink, a busy tattoo parlour on Sydney's Eastern beaches, including Jan Bearman, who was prompted by the death of her beloved daughter to make a decision that took the rest of her family and friends by surprise. 'Before I lost my darling Shell I wouldn't have dreamed of having a tattoo. But when something like that happens you're left grasping at straws. There's a hole left in your life and all you can do is say your prayers,' Jan told Daily Mail Australia. For the past three years, Jan Bearman has had a new tattoo inked on her shoulder every birthday in memory of her daughter Shell, who died of complications from diabetes in . Jan's daughter Shelley died in 2011 at the age of 56 of complications from her diabetes . 'There were reminders of her all around me, and I decided to get a reminder of her on me,' Jan, now 83, said. When Shelley, who was fondly nicknamed Shell, died in 2011 at the age of 56 from complications of the diabetes she had lived with for nearly all her life, two of Jan's granddaughters and Shell's husband decided to get tattoos in memory of her. 'And then I just couldn't think of a reason to not get one,' Jan said. 'Shell was just such a gorgeous girl. It's a loss that leaves a hole in your heart that's never filled again. You do these things as a memorial, to carry [her] with you,' she said. Jan said that when she announced her decision to her family, they were quite surprised but supportive the unexpected move from the now 83-year-old. 'I think they were a bit surprised but they didn't say ""don't do it"", they said ""go ahead if it will make you feel better"",' she said. 'I tried to con my other daughter into getting one too but she wasn't having any of it.' Soon after the decision had been made, Jan was spending the day with one of Shell's daughters, when they passed Bondi Ink. 'Shell was just such a gorgeous girl,' said Jan (left) of her eldest daughter, with her other daughter Lisa (right) Jan getting her third tattoo, a shell, by tattoo artist Shaun 'Bones' from Bondi Ink .

The Mark 1 version of Reginald Mitchell's famous design was among the first built in March 1940 but Spitfire P9374, once flown by an airman involved in the Great Escape, never made it to the Battle of Britain as it crash-landed in May 1940. The fighter plane, dubbed the ballerina because of its grace in the skies, was being piloted by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk when it was hit by a single bullet from a German Dornier bomber.

Portugal is a familiar destination for both Rojo and Di Maria as they played for Sporting Lisbon and Benfica respectively before eventually joining United in the summer.

"Beijing (CNN)China's state prosecutors on Friday formally charged the country's former security czar with accepting bribes, making him the highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges. Zhou Yongkang, 72, was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the highest prosecution authority in China, said. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems as well as prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of ""preserving social stability."" Now, prosecutors have accused Zhou of ""taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money"" during his long political career. His alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests, they added. Zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer's views were heard, according to a statement by the prosecutors. His case will be tried in Tianjin, a city near the Chinese capital, Beijing. The president of China's supreme court recently told reporters there would be ""open"" trials for accused former leaders like Zhou. However, the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in Zhou's case. Zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in October 2013. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested last December. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth, in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign, targeting both ""tigers"" and ""flies"" -- high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in Xi's dragnet to date. ""The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members,"" longtime political analyst Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said last year, when the government revealed its formal investigation into Zhou. Many observers also note Zhou's patronage of Bo Xilai, a former Communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013. Bo's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media have cited his

"Shocking CCTV footage has emerged of a British tourist shooting himself in the head in an apparent suicide at a shooting range in Thailand. The horrified reaction of a worker at the range who was supervising the man - identified as Liam Colven, originally from the Isle of Skye - can be seen as he wheels away in shock after trying to stop Mr Colven turning a handgun on himself. The footage was taken from a camera at the Thalang range on Phuket, Thailand, where the British man had arrived by taxi, reportedly following an argument with a male friend. When he hailed the taxi, he asked the driver to 'take me somewhere I can shoot', it was reported. A distressed staff member first tries to stop the man shooting himself, before wheeling away unable to believe what has just happened . Tragic: The man who shot himself has been identified as Liam Colven who was originally from the Isle of Skye . A Foreign Office spokesperson said it is 'urgently working with the authorities in Thailand to establish whether a British national has died in Phuket'. The 21-year-old used an 11mm pistol to shoot himself in the head. The incident happened at around 3pm local time when according to a staffer at the range, Mr Colven bought one package of six bullets and fired them all off at a target, reports the Phuket Gazette. He then asked for three more bullets before turning the gun on himself and firing at point blank range, staff and witnesses told police. Paying tribute to Mr Colven on Facebook last night, friend Alex Macleod said: 'There are no more words to sum up the events of today or to describe the loss and emotions of the people of Skye that has not all ready been said. 'However I consider myself lucky to be a part of a small community that I know will support the family in the days, weeks, & years to come.

Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year. Does luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though?

He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember… Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance. 'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes.

"Spring. The season that brings with it 'the sweet smell of different flowers in odor and in hue'. William Shakespeare once wrote. Try telling that to apparent cold-blooded Manchester City stars Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero, Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala, who chose to pull on their woolies for April's blockbuster Manchester derby in front of an unforgiving Old Trafford crowd; unusually late for this time of year. Admittedly temperatures in the north west on Sunday afternoon were not exactly soaring - hitting between six and eight degrees Celsius by the time of the 4pm kick off - but was it enough to wear gloves while competing as a top athlete for 90 minutes? Probably not. Yaya Toure (left) was one of four players in the Manchester derby who chose to wear gloves at Old Trafford . After another below-par game Toure was described by Gary Neville as a 'weed' in Manchester City's garden . Glove-wearing Sergio Aguero opened the scoring on derby day . It was a far from blossoming performance for the visitors as well, and like autumn leaves City fell embarrassingly to their local rivals. After a less-than-warm welcome and despite springing first at Old Trafford following an early strike from Sergio Aguero, City lacked the killer edge to overcome their adversaries. This time of year is notorious for exposing a plague of unwanted weeds in the garden, and Gary Neville knew this all too well after the clash saw his former enemies lose for the fourth time in six Premier League matches. Eliaquim Mangala looked shaky again in the Manchester City defence but at least his hands stayed warm . Argentina defender Martin Demichelis (right) slides in on Wayne Rooney during the fierce encounter . Outlook: Sprinkles. Partly sunny. Wind: 14 mph . Humidity: ↑ 93% . Temperature: 43(F) 'There are some weeds in the garden and you've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick,' Neville said of the City players - particularly Toure - in his post-match analysis. 'You cannot carry passengers.' Goals from Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling made sure under-fire boss Manuel Pellegrini would be thinking about preparing his weed killer by the end of the night. But it wasn't only the City quartet who needed the warmth... Fourth official at Old Trafford, Jonathan Moss, was also sporting a pair of hand warmers whilst introducing both sets of substitutes on Sunday. However, we'll let him off, he was only watching. Fourth official Jonathan Moss was also among those to wrap up warm at Old Trafford .

The scruffily-attired ex-footballer was seen walking arm-in-arm with on-off partner Rocio Oliva, with the blonde pictured leaning on his shoulder affectionately. Just five months ago, he was labelled a 'psychopath' after video footage emerged which appeared to show him assaulting Ms Oliva. Scroll down for video . Forgive and forget: Maradona and his on-off girlfriend Rocio Oliva, 24, were pictured strolling through Vienna on Saturday just months after she filmed him allegedly assaulting her . In the video, Maradona, who captained Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 before managing the side with less success, can be seen getting up from his sofa and approaching his Ms Oliva to berate her for using her mobile phone. Oliva filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone?' She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. Following the video's release, the former footballer played down the incident insisting he had only knocked the phone out of her hands. Scruffy attire: The 54-year-old ex-footballer looked less than smart as he walked through the Austrian capital .

"The town of Reading may have been swept up in FA Cup euphoria, but Steve Clarke has instructed his players to approach this weekend's semi-final like any other day at work. It has been 88 years since the Royals last reached the last-four juncture and the SkyBet Championship side travel to Wembley facing the unenviable task of overcoming in-form Arsenal. Reading are striving to make the FA Cup final for the first time in their history, leading to excitement understandably building in Berkshire - if not the club's Hogwood Park training ground. Reading overcame League One side Bradford with a 3-0 replay win to progress to FA Cup semi-final . Clarke, a winner as player and coach at Chelsea, has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion, with progression the only objective. 'I think when you go through to semi-finals, the only way to enjoy it is to win the game,' the Reading manager said. 'You can't go to Wembley and play the occasion. It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal. 'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch. The Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley . 'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run. 'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.' Clarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith. One bookmaker has them at 14/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins. It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup . 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.' Reading have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final, with Pavel Pogrebnyak fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of Tuesday's 1-0 loss to table-topping Bournemouth. Steve Clarke was appointed Reading manager in December 2014 to replace Nigel Adkins . Clarke felt defeat was harsh on his side, stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter-final replay against Bradford. 'Cup competitions, one-off games, we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom, a little less nervousness, if you like,' the Royals boss said. 'I think the league campaign has been disappointing. There is sort of a feeling of doom and gloom around the league campaign this year which is never nice. Reading have struggled in the Championship but have brought FA Cup euphoria to the town with their great run

"A Texas state trooper who did what millions of hip-hop fans would love to do and posed for a picture with Snoop Dogg was told he has ''deficiencies indicating need for counseling'. Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears posed for the photograph with Snoop at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech. Spears, who is based out of the state's Gilmer office, posed for the photo at the rapper's request. Scroll down for video . Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears (left) was disciplined last week for posing with Snoop Dogg . Snoop requested the photo at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech . Spears' bosses called Snoop a figure who has a 'criminal background including numerous drug charges' After his publicist took the photo, Snoop - whose real name is Calvin Broadus - posted it to Instagram with the caption: 'Me n my deputy dogg'. Spears' bosses at DPS saw the posting and then cited him, according to the Dallas Morning News. The official reprimand read: 'While working a secondary employment job, Trooper Spears took a photo with a public figure who has a well-known criminal background including numerous drug charges. 'The public figure posted the photo on social media and it reflects poorly on the Agency.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him. Snoop has convictions for drug possession and stood trial for murder in 1993 before being acquitted. Since Spears was only reprimanded with counseling, DPS does not view the penalty as a formal disciplinary action and the trooper cannot appeal. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said on Wednesday: 'DPS does not typically discuss or release specifics of personnel issues unless they result in disciplinary action as outlined in Government Code 411.00755 and 411.0072. 'Supervisors counsel and coach employees on a regular basis, and these efforts do not constitute formal discipline by the department.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him but that's about it . Attorney Ty Clevenger is representing Spears and covering the case on his blog. He wrote: 'DPS claims that the counseling forms are not really discipline, therefore the employee has no right to appeal. 'Yet those counseling incidents can block a trooper’s chances for promotion or advancement. 'So it appears that DPS commanders are papering Billy’s file with counseling incidents because they can’t prove that he violated any law, order, or policy, and they know that he will beat them with the law and the facts if he is given an opportunity to appeal.' Clevenger is calling public attention to the situation and has written letters to officials at DPS. It seems the Department of Public Safety has a problem with Snoop but Austin police seem okay with him .

"(CNN)Do you remember the talk about plans for Iraqi-led force to try to take back Mosul this spring? Well, you might want to forget it. Nearly three months after a U.S. official said up to 25,000 Iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern Iraqi city in April or May, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said Thursday that Washington is ""not putting a timeframe on"" a possible invasion. It ""might be some time from now. Might be soon,"" another senior administration official said. Mosul has long been the big prize in the Iraqi government's fight -- aided by a U.S.-led military coalition, which has carried out airstrikes for months -- to defeat ISIS. It has also long been a source of embarrassment, considering how it fell after Iraqi troops dropped their weapons, abandoned their posts and ran for their lives when militants arrived last June. The senior administration officials who talked to reporters Thursday stressed the Iraqis and their allies are making progress in their fight against the group that calls itself the Islamic State. In fact, officials insist that ISIS has been degraded substantially thanks to a combination of air power and ground combat. The biggest and most recent example of this came with the recapture a few weeks ago of Tikrit, the hometown of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein that is located some 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Baghdad. Iraqi forces aided by Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen took that northern city, the same place where ISIS allegedly massacred Iraqi troops last year. Still, Mosul isn't Tikrit. For one thing, it has a lot more people -- about a million, one Obama administration official noted. And it's more important not only to Iraq, but ISIS, meaning the terrorist group has all the more reason to go all-out to defend it. In some ways, the campaign for Mosul has begun, according to officials. There are no plans for U.S. combat troops involvement in an eventual operation, they say, but airstrikes have already targeted ISIS positions in the area. Just because the area has been softened up some from the air, though, doesn't mean a full ground assault is imminent. Calling for ""patience,"" an administration official said that winning Mosul is a complex endeavor. It will ""take a lot of capacity,"" the official said, ""and some time to build.""

"A mother-of-five murdered her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper before hiding her body in a suitcase, a court has heard. Portugese national Claudia Martins, 33, gave birth alone in the bath at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol, having kept the pregnancy a secret for nine months. Bristol Crown Court heard after she allegedly pushed the tissue in the infant's mouth, she wrapped the baby girl in towels and a plastic bag and hid the body in a suitcase - where it was found three days later. Claudia Martins, 33, gave birth alone in the bath at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol, having allegedly kept the pregnancy a secret. She is on trial at Bristol Crown Court (pictured) accused of murdering the baby girl . Paramedics were called to the property after friends and family members found 'a lot of blood' in the bath and Martins was taken to hospital. The court heard Martins repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant. During her hospital stay, Martins' sister noticed a smell coming from the suitcase and called police after she opened it and saw blood. Police found the body of a newborn baby inside a small black suitcase. Martins, who was described as having an extremely low IQ, was arrested and admitted that she had given birth, but said the baby was stillborn. A post-mortem examination found a wad of toilet paper inside the baby's mouth, which experts claim was 'deliberately inserted'. Martins, who denies a single charge of murder on September 12 last year, wept during the opening of her trial at Bristol Crown Court today. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, said two police officers were called to the flat Martins shared with her sister on September 15 last year. 'They were shown to the bathroom of the flat, where they saw and opened a suitcase,' he said. 'Inside, wrapped in towels and in a black plastic bag, they found the body of a newborn baby girl. Martins was rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary (pictured) but repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant - she was later arrested after her sister discovered the baby's body in a suitcase . 'The baby had been born three days earlier to the defendant, Claudia Martins. 'It is the prosecution's case that she killed the baby as soon as it was born and that she hid the body in the suitcase. 'It is the defence case that she never knew she was pregnant and when she gave birth it was stillborn and that she hid it in the suitcase out of a mixture of shock and panic.' The jury heard Martins is originally from Mozambique but moved to Portugal before settling in Bristol in 2011. She lived in a two-bedroom flat with her sister, Vilma Marshall, Ms Marshall's partner, and five children, which was 'difficult and pressurised', Mr Vaitilingam said. In late 2013 Martins became pregnant and the father of the baby was later identified by DNA analysis as Polish man

"England’s fourth Six Nations runners-up finish in a row has been labelled ‘unacceptable’ by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie, with head coach Stuart Lancaster told performances must improve before the World Cup. Lancaster’s men suffered heartache as their thrilling 55-35 victory over France on Saturday saw them fall six points short of overhauling Ireland and securing a first title since 2011. But Ritchie said: ‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about. We should be winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things. England are left reeling on the pitch as their 55-35 victory against France failed to secure the title . Captain Chris Robshaw (fourth right) looks dejected after England concede a try to France at Twickenham . Stuart Lancaster (left) and his players ponder a second-placed finish for a fourth successive season . ‘We had opportunities, let’s be clear — entirely in our control. The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. We did not do enough. There’s no point in bleating about it. ‘We didn’t take opportunities, didn’t do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win.’ But there was more than a little sense that Ian Ritchie was playing to his audience at Twickenham. And not only because the RFU’s affable chief executive quoted Hamlet when describing the ‘slings and arrows of outrageous fortune’ he experienced watching the engrossing Six Nations denouement. His public pronouncements were designed to strike a chord with those still uncomfortable with the six-year contracts served to England’s coaches last year. They were also designed as a shot across head coach Stuart Lancaster’s bows. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie (right) chats to Lancaster at England's base in Pennyhill Park in Bagshot . Ritchie (left) and Lancaster talk in the Twickenham stands prior to England's clash with New Zealand . Ritchie, an intelligent and thoughtful man, needed very little pressing to deliver the headline-grabbing line that England’s fourth successive runners-up spot under Lancaster was ‘unacceptable’. Often it takes hundreds of questions to extract such strong quotes from a senior figure. Yesterday it took two. It was almost as if Ritchie had decided what he was going to say in advance. This was no slip of the tongue. More a clever piece of brinkmanship designed to keep the pressure on Lancaster. The aim was also to avoid accusations that complacency has crept into an organisation which has pulled itself back from the brink in the public’s eyes since the dark days surrounding the scandal-hit 2011 World Cup campaign. Ritchie, the man at the top of an organisation now delivering everywhere but on the pitch, felt the need to crack the whip. Just not too hard. ‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about,’ said the former chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. ‘If you go back through history, bearing in mind a lot

"A tiny Scottish hamlet named Towie is bracing itself for the world's next gold rush - after prospectors found evidence that it sits on major deposits. The remote community in Aberdeenshire does not even have a shop but local streams have been well known for grains of gold of 'significant size' for decades. Towie has been ignored by investors in favour of the oil industry but a two-year investigation has revealed the possible existence of gold deposits worth millions. A significant deposit is believed by scientists to lie somewhere near Towie which shares its name with the popular Essex reality TV show . Sleepy Towie, population 300, has a single road, a few houses, primary school, church, graveyard and a community hall . Turkish mining giant Koza Altin Isletmeleri and a Highland firm GreenOre are now seeking planning permission for further investigation. GreenOre managing director Gavin Berkenheger, 31, said: 'This area in Aberdeenshire has all the right hallmarks of a major deposit to be hiding underneath the surface. 'We looked at the geology and found some really exciting rocks with potential for a large deposit. 'Over two years we have found that the whole of Aberdeenshire is a ripe area for gold mineralisation. We're just trying to locate where the gold deposit is.'

'Then from the streams with high gold content, we will crack open any rocks we think have the potential of hosting gold.

"His legacy is everywhere on this glorious island. From roads and agriculture to the design of the local flag, Napoleon Bonaparte transformed Elba when he was banished here in 1814. Famously, he didn't stay for long. It was 200 years ago that he escaped, bound for Waterloo and on to a more permanent exile in St Helena. But the locals still revere the celebrity prisoner who, for just under a year, was formally recognised as the King of Elba. Inviting: The pretty harbour of Portoferraio in Elba, an island which lies just 12 miles off the coast of Tuscany . In this anniversary year, there are plenty of pageants and parades in his honour. Yet, as I sit bobbing on the waters below his villa, I can't help thinking that Napoleon must have spent his later years wondering why he ever left. For there is something magical, something other about Elba. Half the size of the Isle of Wight, this fish-shaped island has 3,000ft peaks, coral reefs, beaches of every complexion and Italy's lowest crime rate. Though just 12 miles off the coast of Tuscany, it bears little resemblance to the chi-chi tourist trap of Chiantishire. The vast majority of visitors who make the one-hour ferry crossing from Piombino are ordinary Italians (we don't meet a Briton all week). With a tiny airport, it has been spared major development, and half of its 85 square miles area is national park. Many beaches and bays can be reached only by hiking, biking or, better still, by boat. That is why Elba is perfect for a sailing holiday, whether you are a sailor or not. A comfortable six-bed, 40ft yacht can be a lot cheaper than a hotel or villa. You'd be hard-pushed to find a view to match the one from our deck as we sit back, beer in hand, and watch the sun set behind Monte Capanne. Blissful bobbing: Lovely Porto Azzurro is an ideal place to drop anchor, perfect for pizzas and people-watching . Kent-based Nautilus Yachting has yachts all over the Med and has been organising charters around Elba and the Tuscan archipelago for years. We settle on a Bavaria 40, a popular cruising yacht with a flip-down bathing platform at the back. Little sailors: Robert's children adored life on board . The only question is: who will do the sailing? Nautilus can organise a skipper for £90 a day. But having been messing around in boats since childhood, I want to take charge. You might almost call it a Napoleon complex (my wife does). So I have to go back to school. The basic requirement for renting anything larger than a day boat is the Royal Yachting Association's Day Skipper certificate, within easy reach of the average dinghy sailor. It involves a five-day practical sailing course plus a detailed theory course. You can do the latter online, but you must live aboard for the practical part. Sunsail runs flotillas and courses all over the world, and I join the fleet on the Solent. It proves invaluable; after five days

"(CNN)This week, social media heralded as #motheroftheyear Toya Graham, the Baltimore single mom who pulled her son, who was holding a brick, away from the scene of a riot. A video of Graham yanking young Michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral. Many called her a hero: a mother determined to stop the cycle of violence. And yet, wasn't she also promoting violence? Her own reaction, after all, was to yell, curse and hit. ""Why is America celebrating the beating of a black child?"" asked a writer at The Washington Post. Isn't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home? Isn't this why rioting happens? I'm not excusing violence in any form. I wish it didn't exist. But Baltimore isn't on fire because of mothers like Graham. In fact, what we need, not only in communities like Baltimore but also in communities around the country, are more mothers like her. Mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence. I don't see Graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel, or at least the inevitability, of violence. I don't see her as a hero, either. What I do see in Graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents, mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence. Mothers who know the anger and frustration that can result when they catch their teenager in a lie. As Graham told Anderson Cooper, she'd told Michael the night before not to join in any riots. He swore he wouldn't. But her momma bear sense kicked in, and when she heard that school was closing early, she didn't take the chance that he'd stick to his promise. She went to the site of the riots to make sure that she could help him stay the course. She went there so that she could help him keep his promise. And when she got there and saw he hadn't, as she suspected, she reacted in the way that she knew would, in that moment, be most effective to get him out of there. And that's the key here. It's easy to punish a teenager for acting out, just as it's easy to punish Graham for taking out her frustrations on Michael in a physical way. But Graham's actions are evidence of her commitment as a parent. For better or worse, she knows her son. And she knows her community, and her reality. She knows that she's the mother of an adolescent boy living in a city caught up in a very heated, violent moment. And she will do anything to protect her son, including put herself in a dangerous situation to pull him out of there. Can we all say that? Toya Graham raises an important point that's often missing in the discussions of how to

"Super midwife Kathleen McSherry has retired after delivering a record 7,000 babies. Colleagues believe Kathleen, 66, from Faifley, West Dunbartonshire, has notched up more births than any other British midwife in a career spanning six decades. She said: 'It's been a labour of love. Every delivery has been a very special moment for me. Bringing a new life into the world is the best job in the world.' Kathleen McSherry from Faifley, West Dunbartonshire, has delivered more than 7,000 babies since 1966 . Kathleen with one of her many deliveries, left, and hard at work for Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS . She continued: 'The sheer joy of being at a family's happiest moment is truly wonderful. I'll miss it so much.' Kathleen, who is a fan of the hit TV show Call the Midwife, has spent her career in the bustling maternity wards of three busy Glasgow hospitals - Stobhill, The Queen Mother's and the Southern General. The father of a child she delivered worked out she must have delivered more than 7,000 babies - based on the fact she's delivered three babies per shift on average. Fellow midwives agree they are unaware of anyone who has helped deliver so many babies. Kathleen's daughter Ashley, who set up a Facebook page in her honour, said: 'She has enjoyed every one of her days working to deliver babies and we are all very proud of her service to the NHS. I think she will miss it so much now she's retired.' The mother-of-four and grandmother-of-five has enjoyed a career which mirrors her favourite TV programme, Call The Midwife. Kathleen, second from right, has been delivering babies at three Glasgow hospitals for six decades . Kathleen started training in the 60s and her career mirrors that of her favourite TV programme Call the Midwife . She began her training in 1966 aged just 17, after working as a sales assistant in the former Glen's department store in Glasgow. During her career there has never been a dull moment. She has assisted at the births of two babies born in hospital car parks and has even had two children named after her. 'It's a lovely compliment and one that midwives love,' Kathleen said. She's delivered too many twins to mention and has also delivered countless children and grandchildren of the children she's brought into the world. 'You can plan to have your baby in hospital but they often have minds of their own and arrive at the least expected time,' she said. 'They set the agenda and there is little you can do when a determined baby decides it's time to be born.' The most magical moment in Kathleen's career was being at the birth of two of her grandchildren . She also had a surprise delivery of her own when she was forced to advise husband Jim, 67, a retired firefighter, what to do when she went into labour with their fourth child Katey. 'It was five in the morning when I woke up in labour and Jim ushered our older kids, Pauline,

"David Cameron's claim to be a 'tax-cutting politician' was under fire last night – as a study found the Coalition has raised taxes by more than £16billion a year. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies said the net effect of changes by the Coalition had raised taxes by an average £255 for every person in the UK. The respected think-tank found the tax rises totalled £64.3billion – including a £14billion hike in VAT and a £5.2billion increase in National Insurance contributions. Millions of people have been dragged into paying the 40p tax rate for the first time – and inheritance tax has increased as thresholds have been frozen for years. Humiliating: Revelation that the Coalition has raised taxes is embarrassing for Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured), who has spoken repeatedly of his desire to be seen as a 'tax cutter' The tax hikes have been only partially offset by reductions totalling £48billion – including £8billion from raising the personal income tax threshold, £5.9billion in lowering corporation tax and £3.9billion from real-terms cuts in fuel duties. Ministers insist the tax rises were needed to help plug the budget deficit left by Labour. Sources say they had no choice but to take 'difficult decisions' to save Britain from bankruptcy. But the findings remain embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who has spoken repeatedly of his desire to be seen as a 'tax cutter'. They show the value of the rise in personal income tax allowance has been wiped out by rises in other levies. In next week's Budget, Chancellor George Osborne, is expected to announce a further increase in the personal allowance, along with modest cuts in alcohol duties. But Treasury sources admit they have little money to play with. The IFS said the Coalition's changes represented a 'missed opportunity to improve the tax system', with little attempt to address 'fundamental structural deficiencies'. Several of the changes have increased 'unwelcome distortions' in the system, the think-tank added. It said it was difficult to find a 'good economic reason' for lifting lower-paid workers out of income tax while leaving National Insurance thresholds largely untouched – warning it was an 'absurdity' that the two taxes were not integrated. Warned: The UK Statistics authority has 'ticked off' Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls for claiming the number of workers on zero-hours contracts had increased by 400,000 in recent months . Ed Balls has been ticked off by the statistics watchdog for claiming the number of workers on zero-hours contracts had increased by 400,000 in recent months. Sir Andrew Dilnot, of the UK Statistics Authority, said Mr Balls's statement was incorrect, as it relied on comparing totals at two different times of year and ignored the possibility that some people could hold multiple contracts for different jobs. The study praised last year's stamp duty reforms. But it warned that council tax had been allowed to get 'ever more out of date', with bands in England and Scotland based on 1991 property prices. It added that areas such as fuel duties and business rates had seen 'ad hoc, often temporary, announcements overtaking each

Trevor David Jones, 57, of Lyndoch in South Australia's Barossa Valley, allegedly snuck into the Kellermeister winery in the early hours of February 22 and opened the taps on four tanks to release 25,000 litres of wine.

Kellermeister owner Mark Pearce said he made the 'unfortunate' discovery on the morning of the incident. 'We're pretty lucky that the wine that was affected was some of our chardonnay and back vintage wines so all of our higher value wines were unaffected and, you know, are safe and sound,' Mr Pearce told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is what it is. We can't do much about it, it's in the hands of the police now.' Mr Pearce said his winery predominantly produced high-value shiraz-based wines. A spokeswoman for the Barossa Grape and Wine Association said 'it's disappointing that it's happened' but declined to comment further as it is a legal matter.

Richard Avedon: Family Affairs opens Wednesday at the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia. The collection starkly depicts dozens of U.S. movers and shakers from the 1960s and '70s - including Edward Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Nelson Rockefeller and George Bush - in the artist's trademark black-and-white style. Also featured is a small biographical display on Avedon, who was raised Jewish in New York.

Muses: Richard Avedon: Family Affairs is now on in Philadelphia (from left, Katharine Graham president of The Washington Post Company, Barbara C. Jordan the first African American congresswoman and Bella Abzug, a member of U.S. Congress and champion of women's rights) 'Avedon's work is generally shown in art museums as art, with very little historical interpretation,' said chief curator Josh Perelman. 'We invite Avedon in both as a creator and a character.' Avedon made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, but 'Family Affairs' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for Rolling Stone magazine. Originally planning to spotlight the campaigns of incumbent Gerald Ford and challenger Jimmy Carter, Avedon soon realized he wanted to include a wider array of the era's most influential people, Perelman said. Men in suits comprise nearly all his subjects, distinguished by variations in their stances and expressions: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, consumer advocate Ralph Nader and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to name a few.

Rise to fame: Avedon (seen in self potraits above) made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, but 'Family Affairs' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for Rolling Stone magazine . Only a handful of the 12-by-15-inch framed images portray women or minorities, among them Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham and labor activist Cesar Chavez. Rolling Stone called the 69 portraits 'The Family,' though the only people with biological ties are Ted Kennedy and his mother, Rose. Visitors can also page through hard copies of the 40-year-old magazine issue, or look at a digital edition. Yet the exhibit space is dominated by a wall-size display of poet Allen Ginsberg's family. It's one of four featured group portraits that Avedon took between 1969 and 1971. Much smaller pictures include Andy Warhol and members of The Factory; the Chicago 7, who were arrested during the 1968 Democratic National Convention; and the Mission Council, who were key players in the Vietnam

"Between getting children dresses, breakfast on the table, lunches packed and the school run, mornings can be one of the least relaxing times of day. And more specifically, a study of 2.3 million has revealed that 7.35am is the most hectic, frenzied time of the morning routine for Australian families. Sophie Falkiner, Australian TV presenter, model and mother of two, can testify to that. 'It’s crazy, in the mornings there is a million and one things to do - uniforms to be found, spelling tests to get done,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Crazy o'clock: A study of 2.3 million parents has pinpointed 7.35am as the most hectic, frenzied time of day in Australian households . Out the door: Getting breakfast, kids dressed and the school run is the cause of much mayhem . Mum of two: Sophie Falkiner has told Daily Mail Australia that she has a 'million and one' things to do in the mornings to get her children out the door . 'The kids get up at 7am so I have to get up at 6.30 to give myself time to have a coffee and get exercise in before starting the day,' the 41-year-old former Great Outdoors and Wheel of Fortune presenter added. According to the study, conducted by Kraft, breakfast is the top priority for parents - with an average of 140 hours spent making breakfast each year (equivalent to 25 minutes a day). 'We're out the door by 8am, so when we all have time to sit together and have breakfast it's the only zen time we have,' said Falkiner. Time it: Australian parents spend an average 140 hours per year getting children breakfast . 'It will only be 15-20 minutes together (and I wish it could be longer!) but these days people are time poor and its hard to get everything done and be nutritious,' she said. 'My daughter’s not a breakfast person, so getting a quick nut spread and toast in is quick and easy before we head out the door.' The study also found that nut spreads are a popular choice for breakfast loving kids, with Aussie kids eating spreads 6.7 times a week. Mum knows best: Sophie Falkner, mum of two, believes nuts are high in protein and good for fussy eaters . Falkiner, who also has a certificate in nutrition says that nuts are a big part of her children's diet and are packed full of nutritional benefits. 'Nuts are packed with good protein. So the spreads are good for fussy eaters, they give your kids important brain food and energy, protein and it helps keep them full until lunch time.' Falkiner's tip is to mix up how you serve nut spreads to make it both fun and varied for kids. 'I will do peanut butter in celery sticks for the kids then on weekend as a treat they will get pancakes and hazelnut spread,' she said.

The 47 year old single mum from Southampton, was beaten up to 30 times a day by her daughter Sapphire, nine, and regularly locked herself away in her bedroom to escape from harm. Her son Spencer, 11,who often joined in with the abuse, was the first to violently abuse his mother - aged four, he stabbed her in the stomach with a pair of scissors. Scroll down for video . Pauline Bubb, 46, from Southampton, who was violently attacked by her 11 year-old-son Spencer, and nine-year-old daughter Sapphire (Pictured from left: Sapphire, Pauline, Spencer and Jorja) The only one of her children who didn't resort to violence was Sapphire's twin sister Jorja, who would often leave the room when the beatings started. Unable to cope, Pauline turned to Channel 5 as a last ditch attempt after hearing about their new programme, My Violent Child. In an interview with the Mirror today, she said: 'I was frightened of my own kids - my legs would often be bruised and I had to keep them covered.' The violence got so bad that Pauline started to dread her children coming home from school and would start shaking as the clock started to move towards 3.30pm. Pauline sought help from the makers of a Channel 5 documentary My Violent Child after years of violence at home at the hands of her children . The aggression would often start as soon as they walked through the front door, with the attacks escalating to the stage where Sapphire once bit her face. In one incident, Spencer attempted to strangle his mother from behind while she was sat in a chair. But while Spencer's behaviour calmed down once he was diagnosed with ADHD, Sapphire's continued to worsen. Pauline said: 'She started off two years ago with controlling behaviour - she would ask me a question like, 'Can I have a packet of crisps?' but then say 'Yes Sapphire'. 'Then I had to say it, but exactly how she wanted me to. I couldn't say it too fast or too slow, I had to stand still, I couldn't move, I couldn't blink and she would repeat herself 20 or 30 times. 'If I said no, she would get louder, start swearing and hit me.' Pauline comforts her daughter Sapphire after one of her tantrums . Although many people would find it incredulous that Pauline allowed the abuse to escalate over a number of years without getting any help, she explains that she was too embarrassed to do anything about the situation. Pauline isn't alone - the number of violent young children in the UK is rising steadily, with 118 boys and girls under the age of 14 prosecuted for domestic abuse in 2012/13.

Tayler Chaice Buzbee was forced to make an emergency appointment at an Aspen Dental facility in Alabama on Friday morning after developing agonizing toothache which would not go away. But after calling the dentist's office, she was informed that the only available appointment was in just 20 minutes - meaning that she had no time to find a babysitter for her infant son, Attley. Instead, Tayler was assured by employees that she could bring her baby to the facility. The pair turned up shortly after - but midway through the appointment, Attley started to create a fuss.

'I don't nurse in public, and I never have because I hear these stories about people being shamed... I don't do well with being confronted, so I usually find another room to go to,' Tayler toldAL.com. But she said that, in this instance, she had no option but to breastfeed Attley - a gorgeous dark-haired baby with big brown eyes and a cheeky grin - because he was hungry and causing a scene. The hygienists apparently did not mind Tayler nursing her son - and one even offered to halt the treatment and return when she was finished. But Tayler declined and continued to be treated. A short while later, the dentist and another female employee came into the room. The latter reportedly told Tayler that she was not permitted to breastfeed her baby in the dentist's office. Then, while the dentist examined Tayler's teeth, the employee removed Attley from her arms - without permission and before he had finished feeding from his mom - because he was 'in the way'. She then placed him in a stroller, it is reported. Tayler, who was shocked, left the office soon after.

He had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Changes: Five decades after his high school photo with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair, Dr. Brandt was pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair . It is two days since the famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. The City of Miami Police confirmed the suicide after Daily Mail Online broke the news earlier, and, according to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show. Now, seen here for the first time, Dr Brandt’s High School photos provide a glimpse into his life before fame, fortune and fillers. The pictures, taken in 1967, show a hint of the smile that, according to the school’s yearbook earned him a reputation for his ‘infectious grin’ and saw him characterized by his sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.’ Born Frederic Sheldon Brandt in 1949, he was prolific in his High School achievements, posing in one photo alongside other award-winning students. Among his many accolades listed are Assistant Editor of High School magazine the Morellian, President of the Spanish Club, Vice President of the Debate Club, Vice President of the Political Science Club and a place on the National Honors Society. He was also an enthusiastic member of the Theatre Arts Society and Tennis team. He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student. But, for all that, in one of his last interviews, given to the New York Times in March 2014, he recalled feeling very much that he was ‘more of a different child,’ as he grew up in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey. He said: ‘I remember taking things apart as a kid, radios

"A church has come under fire over plans to dig up thousands of bodies - including the founder of Western Australia - to make way for a car park. St John's Stoke church, in Guildford, Surrey, wants to build a community centre in its grave yard and replace the current centre with a car park. But the scheme, which would see remains dug up, cremated and reburied in a mass grave, has already sparked outrage with opponents producing a 1,400-signature petition in a bid to save the graveyard. St John's Stoke church (pictured), in Guildford, Surrey, wants to build a community centre in its grave yard and replace the current centre with a car park . The body of Sir James Stirling, a navy admiral and the first governor of Western Australia, is buried in the graveyard . An international dispute threatens to break out as the body of Sir James Stirling, a navy admiral and the first governor of Western Australia, is buried in the graveyard - but the church is not sure where. Reverend Mark Woodward, the church's rector, said: 'We have heard a large number of views ranging from strong opposition to our plans, to very strong support in favour. 'We hope and pray that something very positive will come from the proposal to see land used to help fund an excellent new community project. Sir James Stirling become the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Western Australia . It was Sir James Stirling’s persistence that finally persuaded the British government to establish the Swan River Colony in Western Australia. The British naval officer, who was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1791, had explored the area before lobbying officials to allow him to establish a settlement. And it was a move that would eventually see him become the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Western Australia. Stirling entered the navy at the age of 12 and went on to serve in the Napoleonic wars and the war between Britain and the US in 1812. He married Ellen Mangles at Stoke Church, Guildford, on September 3 1823. They went on to have five sons and six daughters. Stirling travelled to Australia a few years later as part of a navy assignment and joined an inland expedition – eventually taking him to the west. He would go on to oversee the development of the surrounding area and remained in his post until 1838 when he resumed his naval career. Stirling became an admiral in the 1860s and died in retirement at Guildford on April 22 1865. 'We are in contact with the descendants of some families who believe they have ancestors interred in the graveyard and we are listening very carefully. We are committed to working very closely with all interested parties. 'It is inspiring to see our church facilities put to such great and varied use by so many people every week, but we are simply running out of space.' Sir Stirling was buried at the site following his death in 1865 but when a new rectory was built on the western

"A Japanese woman got sweet revenge on her cheating boyfriend by giving his Apple collection a good wash. The unnamed heartbroken girlfriend clearly knew how to hit her lying lover where it hurts, and dumped his iMac, iPhone, iPad and accessories in the bath tub. She then took photos of the gadget Jacuzzi, and sent them to him. Presumably on the one item of technology that wasn't currently taking a long soak. A Japanese woman got sweet revenge on her cheating boyfriend by giving his Apple collection a good wash . The woman scorned took the trouble to give his iMac - which start at £899 - a single soaking . As most of us know, a substantial splash is enough to send your gadget to glitch town, and so the dip this man's prized collection took is sure to prove irreversible damage. Particularly as the woman scorned took the trouble to give his iMac - which start at £899 - a single soaking. Just to make doubly sure the water damage was total. Even if he tries the recommended trick of leaving his gadgets in uncooked rice for 48 hours, we think all the rice in Japan couldn't dry this lot out. Clearly feeling little remorse for his sins and perhaps looking for sympathy, the unnamed man, also from Japan, Tweeted the pics to his account @foolishnessfly2. Retweeted more than 15,400 times, the response has been mixed. The hearts of Apple fans are mainly with the man, with the general consensus being that destroying a fellow's prized Apple collection is a bit harsh, even if he did cheat. This Twitterer fully supported the Japanese woman's actions, hailing it as 'the best revenge' @womenspeakup pointed out that the guy should be counting his lucky stars that it was his Apple and not his, er, banana that paid the price of cheating . @jewlish spoke the words of women the world over with a 'you go, girl!'.

While others agree that revenge is a dish best served in hot water. Although a lot of the comments were in Japanese (and the 'translate' button did little to help), the English-language responses were in favour of the woman's methods. @babysdoc hailed it as 'the best revenge', while @jewlish spoke the words of women the world over with a 'you go, girl!'. @womenspeakup pointed out that the guy should be counting his lucky stars that it was his Apple and not his, er, banana that paid the price of cheating, referring to Lorena Bobbit who cut off her husband's penis with a knife.

"Michael Vaughan, who is favourite to become England’s cricket supremo, was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on. With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit. If you can’t play that, you’re in the wrong job.’ Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England's top order for just looking to survive . Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua . Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning . Former fast bowler Bob Willis said: ‘England’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs.’ West Indies’ early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves, the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, who labelled the opposition ‘mediocre’.

"A drought in the western United States has left water levels in the Colorado River basin far below their normal levels. Lake Powell, a reservoir at the Arizona-Utah border, is 45 per cent below its capacity, and the lack of water has left a 'bathtub ring' at the bottom of its majestic rock formations. The lake, from which the Colorado eventually snakes through Grand Canyon National Park, has lost 4.4 trillion gallons of water in a recent drought. The river's basin has been experiencing the drought for eleven of the last 14 years, shrinking a reservoir that was one-fourth the size of Rhode Island when it was at 'full pool', according to National Geographic. Scroll down for video . Lake Powell, which is the country's second-largest reservoir when it is at 'full pool' capacity, now has a white bathtub ring in its canyons from dropping water levels . The Colorado provides water for Nevada, Arizona and California, the last of which has seen large areas in 'extreme' and 'exceptional' drought levels and is trying to restrict how much water residents use. Seven states and 40million people get water from different parts of the river's basin, which extends into the southern reaches of Wyoming. Many climate scientists think that the Southwest is also due for a megadrought this century that would far outlast the current phenomenon. Lake Mead, the reservoir next to Hoover Dam, shrunk to 39 per cent of its capacity last year and was at its lowest level since the dam was built in the 1930s. To help the other reserve keep a steady supply, Lake Powell will release 8.23 million acre-feet (2.68 trillion gallons) downstream over the course of this year. The release is estimated to lower the water level at Powell, the second largest reservoir in the country behind Mead, by another meter. It is in danger of seeing its surface elevation fall below 1,075 feet above sea level by September, which would be the lowest level on record, set in 2005, and increase the size of its bleached white ring. Minerals in the water turn the walls of the sandstone canyons white, according to the Weather Channel. Minerals in the Colorado River turned the sides of Lake Powell's canyons white before the water levels dropped and the discoloration could be seen . Lake Powell provides water to Nevada, Arizona, and California, which has been experiencing its own drought problems .

"Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Christian Eriksen has warned that they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on qualifying for next season's Europa League. Spurs are sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which would bring European qualification, but there has been talk in the past that Europe's second-tier competition does them more harm than good. Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying outweigh the negatives, though, and admits that the prospect of Europa League football played a big part when he decided to move to White Hart Lane in 2013. Christian Eriksen has warned Tottenham they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on Europe . Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying for the much-maligned Europa League outweigh the negatives . The lack of Champions League football - which Spurs have missed out on since the 2010-11 season - is seen as a barrier to signing top-class players for clubs of Tottenham's size, but Eriksen says missing out on the Europa League would have the same effect. 'Is it a factor when the club are trying to sign players? I think so,' Eriksen said. 'It certainly was for me when I moved from Ajax two years ago. 'I always want to play in Europe, to be seen on that stage or in the Premier League. It was a big chance and for me it was a nice thing when I came to Tottenham.' Tottenham have been linked with Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin and Dynamo Kiev forward Andriy Yarmolenko, and Eriksen worries that Spurs could have to lower their sights if they are not on the European stage next season. Mauricio Pochettino's side currently sit sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which is enough to qualify . Eriksen says the lure of Europa League football was important in his decision to join Spurs back in 2013 . And while he admits that missing out makes finishing higher up the table easier, Eriksen doesn't see many issues with the competition itself. 'I'd rather play in Europe than nothing,' he told the Evening Standard. 'There are many games, of course, but if you have a big squad as we have, it shouldn't be a disappointment to play in Europe. A lot of players want to be in Europe. We've been fighting to get into the top four and we still have a little chance. Florian Thauvin (right), the Marseille midfielder, is one player who has been linked with a move to Spurs . Dynamo Kiev's Andriy Yarmolenko is thought to be another target for Tottenham in the summer market . 'Of course, it is easier to get into the top four if you are not in Europe. There are so many games and we have played more games than most teams in the Premier League this season.' As it stands, the Premier League's top six will all qualify for Europe but if Arsenal win the FA Cup final against Aston Villa that number would extend to the seventh-placed side.

In the film, Nawaz – a convicted former extremist – can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him in a private room during two £20 lap dances. Manager Jay Shah, who witnessed Nawaz’s behaviour, said he was ‘very drunk’ and bouncers threatened to throw him out several times. ‘He was asking her to touch him and he was touching her,’ he said. ‘In general he was quite persistent with her, asking to take her out and for her number.’ A rising star of the Liberal Democrats, 37-year-old Nawaz is also a leading figure in the Muslim community and head of anti-extremism charity the Quilliam Foundation, which he set up. Rising star: The prospective parliamentary candidate with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . A regular guest on BBC News programmes, he declared on Newsnight in 2013: ‘I consider myself a feminist.’ He once wrote on Twitter: ‘You don’t need to be a woman to stand for women’s rights.’ He often throws his weight behind gender issues such as the campaign against female genital mutilation and paints himself as a role model for young Muslim men at risk of radicalisation. But Abdul Malik, the club’s owner, said he wanted the video to be seen by the public because of the way Nawaz portrays himself as a feminist and a family man. ‘He’s always talking about religion on TV and I thought, what a hypocrite,’ he said. He claimed ‘arrogant’ Nawaz acts like a ‘spokesman for Islam’ – but visited the club during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘outrageous’ The full strip club footage, obtained by the Mail, clearly shows Nawaz receiving two five-minute lap dances an hour apart. He and two friends paid £10 entry to the small ‘gentleman’s club’ in Whitechapel and were seen drinking heavily. He left the club alone in the early hours of the morning. During the first session – in which the dancer gets naked – she has to repeatedly remove his hands from her body and pushes him away at one point. During the second dance with the same woman, he also spends time chatting to her – whispering into her ear and trying to touch her hair. Newlywed: Nawaz's

Choose wholegrain breakfast cereals, but not those coated with sugar or honey . Source: NHS Choices . A bowl of Bran Flakes plus a glass of orange juice will account for half your recommended daily amount of sugar. Our everyday diets are packed with ‘stealth’ sugar, sending our intake far above the recommended limits, which according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), should be no more than 12 teaspoons a day. Raisins are very sugary, as are flavoured fat-free yoghurts. And one tablespoon of ketchup can contain as much as one teaspoon of sugar. Some bottled juices and smoothies have as much as 47g of sugar, a lot to consume in just one sitting. Like ketchup, tomato-based pasta sauces and soups also have sugar added to them to balance out the acidity of tomatoes. While cereal and granola bars may have a reputation for being healthy, they too are usually much sweeter than they need to be.

"The families of hostages David Haines and Alan Henning who were murdered by the Islamic extremist Jihadi John have been blessed by the Pope. Aid worker David Haines, of Yorkshire, was beheaded last September after being captured by Islamic state. Alan Henning, 47, a father-of-two, was killed in the same way a month later. Both murders appeared on video and apparently showed Jihadi John, who has recently been unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi, from London, carrying out the killings. Pope Francis met Barbara Henning right), the wife of murdered British hostage Alan Henning, and Michael Haines (centre), the brother of David Haines, at St Peter's Basilica today . Today Pope Francis met the families of the two men at a service aimed at uniting religions and ending extremism. Widow Barbara Henning was brought up to meet the Pope on the steps of St Peter's Basilica in Rome after his rain-soaked general audience. Usually such access is reserved for visiting prelates. Michael Haines, brother of David Haines, was also able to meet the Pope at the ceremony. Since the death of his brother he has dedicated himself to promoting tolerance between religions and unity against extremism. He said the moment 'took my breath away.' Alan Henning (left) was kidnapped on Boxing Day 2013 and murdered in October last year, David Haines (right), who had dedicated his life to helping others across the world was killed in September 2014 . In a telephone interview he said the pope told him he was going to pray for him to 'continue the work that we're doing on unity and tolerance and bringing our communities together.'

"Australia's 'tiny hearts and balls of steel', it's apparently the perfect combination in dealing with asylum seeker boats, and a policy which could be copied by Britain, according to a British commentator. Controversial The Sun columnist Katie Hopkins has heaped praise on Tony Abbott's government for its success in stopping the boats, which was a key election plank. But her backhanded compliments may not sit well with our policy-makers and social justice groups, in which she claimed Australia's strategy of 'threatening them with violence', was the way forward. 'It's time to get Australian,' she wrote. Scroll down for video . 'Threaten them with violence until they bugger off'. Controversial UK commentator Katie Hopkins has written that Australia's approach of having 'balls of steel and tiny hearts' should be followed as policy by the Brits . 'They (Australians) threaten them with violence until they bugger off, throwing cans of Castlemaine in an Aussie version of sharia stoning' said Katie Hopkins . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been 'praised' for leading the charge to stop the boats . 'Their approach to migrant boats is the sort of approach we need in the Med. 'They threaten them with violence until they bugger off, throwing cans of Castlemaine in an Aussie version of sharia stoning.' Her tone has won few friends in Europe and her timing, even less so, slammed as it coincided with the drowning of up to 900 men, women and children on a sunken fishing boat, off Italy. Hopkins went on to write: 'Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches.' 'Australians are like British people but with balls of steel, can-do brains, tiny hearts and whacking great gunships. 'And their approach is working. Migrant boats have halved in number since Prime Minister Tony Abbott got tough.'

"At first their mother put it down to coincidence: one of her twins was performing tasks with her right hand, the other using her left. But when Naomi and Hannah Moxon’s baby teeth started falling out on opposite sides of their mouths, their mother Karen made a surprise discover - her girls were mirror twins. The rare condition, which is thought to occur in around 25 per cent of identical twins, refers to twins who are mirror images of one another. Scroll down for video . Mirror twins: Naomi (left) and Hannah Moxon (right) do everything the opposite way around . Sister act: Naomi (left) and Hannah Moxon (right) with their mother Karen . Like in many cases, Naomi is left handed, while Hannah writes with her right. When they eat, Naomi uses her cutlery the traditional way, while Hannah’s knife and fork are held in reverse. And their hair naturally parts on opposite sides of their heads – Hannah’s on the left, Naomi’s on the right. Yesterday the 19-year-olds, from Peterborough, who are currently competing in BBC talent show The Voice, opened up about their unusual situation. Naomi said: ‘Our mum noticed quite early on that we were doing things with the opposite hands. She would say raise the hand you use to draw and I'd raise one and Hannah would raise the other. 'Then mum mentioned it at one of our check-ups and that's when they said about mirror twins. I don’t think many people know what it is.' ‘There were other things like I use my knife and fork the wrong way round,’ Hannah added, ‘our baby teeth fell out on different sides as well, one of mine would fall out and then within a few days Naomi lost the same tooth on the other side. Also our partings are naturally opposite, although we sometimes wear it the same.’ Hannah (left) and Naomi are starring in the BBC TV show The Voice . Bundles of delight: Although identical, tiny tots Hannah and Naomi are known as mirror twins . The twins, pictured Naomi, left, and Hannah, aged two . In other respects, Hannah and Naomi are remarkably similar, made even more so by the fact they like dressing alike. They share a bedroom – and wardrobe – and they do their make-up in the same way. When they made it through the blind auditions round of The Voice as singing duo Classical Reflections, they wore matching white dresses to perform Nella Fantasia by Sarah Brightman. Hannah said: ‘We like dressing the same, but not always. It's part of our performing act. What's good is that I can ask her to try something on so I can see what it looks like. And we always talk about what suits “us” not what suits “me”.’ ‘We started off as half a person,’ Naomi joked. The pair often finish each other’s sentences, have never spent more than a few hours apart and claim to know what the other is thinking – ‘If someone’s being annoying we can share it with each other

"Scientists have discovered an Achilles’ heel of prostate (pictured) cancer that could lead to better treatment for many men diagnosed with the disease . British scientists have discovered an ‘Achilles’ heel’ in prostate cancer which could lead to better treatments. The disease claims almost 11,000 lives a year in the UK, with most deaths occurring after it spreads around the body. The latest study gets to the root of this spread, and could mean better outcomes for the 42,000 men a year diagnosed with the illness. Scientists funded by Cancer Research UK studied samples taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten affected men. Reading the DNA revealed details of how the cancer metastasises, or spreads, allowing them to build a ‘family tree’ of how the disease changes over time. It seems that most of the cells in a tumour stay where they are. However, a small number have the ability to travel through the body, creating new tumours as they go. These cells are the ‘root’ of the cancer and for a treatment to work, they should be destroyed. In future, doctors may be able to find these key cells in individual patients. They could then be given drugs to wipe them out, with each patient’s treatment tailored to the genetic flaw at the root of their cancer. This should kill the new tumours and prevent more from forming, greatly improving odds of survival. Cambridge University researcher Professor David Neal said some suitable drugs already exist, and that new ones are being developed all the time. However, he cautioned that it will be three to five years before the latest knowledge can be routinely put to use in the NHS. Lead study author Professor Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: ‘We gained a much broader view of prostate cancer by studying both the original cancer and the cells that had spread to other parts of the body. ‘We found that all of the cells that had broken free shared a common ancestor cell in the prostate. ‘The common faults we found in each man could potentially offer new targets for treatment.’ Co-author Dr Ultan McDermott, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, described the finding as a ‘potential Achilles’ heel’. Professor Peter Johnson, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This research lets us look right into the molecular core of cancer.’ Samples were taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten men with the disease (pictured). Reading the DNA revealed details of how the cancer metastasises - or spreads - allowing scientists to understand how the disease changes over time .

"Keeping boys and girls apart at school allows them to keep their ‘innocence’ for much longer, the headmaster of Eton has claimed. Tony Little said children today needed ‘pretty graphic’ sex education from just nine years old because of the pressures they encounter day-to-day. But he claimed that children are able to ‘be themselves’ until way into their teens if they are kept apart from the other sex. Eton headmaster Tony Little said children today needed ‘pretty graphic’ sex education from just nine years old because of the pressures of mixed-sex education . Speaking at an education summit in Dubai, Mr Little said: ‘What does strike me is that in a single-sex environment, particularly at the age of 13, 14, 15, there is an opportunity for both boys and girls to be themselves for longer. To be 'boyish' for longer, to be young girls. ‘One of the real challenges we face as parents and particularly in schools, and this has accelerated in the last few years, is the growing apparent sophistication of children at a younger age. ‘The need even at the age of nine now, pretty graphic sex education because of the pressures that are being put on girls particularly, from the age 11 and upwards.’ Eton - the exclusive boarding school attended by David Cameron, Boris Johnson, Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge - is an all-boys school which costs £30,000-a-year to attend . Tony Little became the first old-Etonian to take over as headmaster of the school in 50 years after being appointed in 2001. Mr Little - who was a pupil at Eton Choir School before moving on to Eton with a bursary - has been outspoken in his criticism of education standards. Last year he said exams had not changed much since Victorian times. He said they oblige students 'to sit alone at their desks in preparation for a world in which, for much of the time, they will need to work collaboratively'. Mr Little also attacked the drive to rank schools, saying: “There is more to education than league tables"". He is set to be replaced as the head of Britain's most famous school by the school's 38-year-old history teacher Simon Henderson. Mr Henderson is believed to be one of the youngest leaders in the 574-year history of the school, founded in 1440 by King Henry VI. Mr Little, who is due to step down this summer as Eton’s headmaster, said it was a ‘sad thing’ that sex education is now needed. After 13 years in the post, Mr Little is due to become chief education officer of the GEMS Education network of schools in Europe, the US and Africa. He told the Global Education and Skills Forum: ‘I guess what I'm saying is in a single sex environment, you can allow innocence to last a little longer.’ The head master claimed single sex schools like his ‘remove some of the pressures’ from children around sex and relationships. He said: ‘There are ways of talking about emotional development and about sexuality with single-gender groups, that

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League's Easter weekend fixtures and the race for promotion across the Football League. 1. Playing Jordan Henderson as a wing back instead of in his normal central midfield position was an idea that went spectacularly wrong for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. The England star, who has taken over the captain’s armband in the absence of Steven Gerrard, gave the ball away 23 times in 90 minutes as he struggled to handle the role at Arsenal. Jordan Henderson (left) toiled as a wing back in Liverpool's defeat against Arsenal and lost the ball 23 times . Henderson, usually a central midfielder, has not given the ball away as much all season for Liverpool . There hasn’t been a single one of his previous 29 Premier League appearances this season in which he’s lost possession more. 2. John O’Shea has clearly learned the canny defender’s art of letting his brain do all the running. The theory is if you get in the right position in the first place, you don’t have to chase to recover. In 90 minutes of helping Sunderland keep a clean sheet against Newcastle, the Ireland international logged just 11.9 metres at sprint speed on the EA Sports performance data. It clearly works for him – he’ll be 34 at the end of this month but remains the sole Premier League outfield player to have appeared in every minute of every game in all competitions for his club this season. John O'Shea only sprinted 11.9 metres during his impressive display in Sunderland's 1-0 win over Newcastle . O'Shea (third left) celebrated Sunderland's win with Costel Pantilimon when the final whistle was blown . For good measure he’s also completed the full 90 minutes of all five European Championship qualifiers for the Republic. 3. Steven Caulker’s form has suffered from playing with too many different partners at QPR but there are signs the former Spurs and Cardiff centre half is returning to his best. The 23-year-old was a towering figure as a West Brom side led by the powerful figure of substitute Victor Anichebe fought to recover from being three goals down at half-time. Steven Caulker (right) wins a header against West Bromwich Albion striker Brown Ideye . Caulker made 20 clearances – as many as the rest of the Rangers back four put together – and more than any other Premier League defender all weekend. 4. Chelsea need have few fears if Diego Costa’s hamstring problems mean they have to rely on Loic Remy for goals in the last eight games of the season. The France international’s tap-in from Eden Hazard’s pass for the winner against Stoke was his fifth Premier League goal of the season from just 456 minutes on the pitch. Loic Remy (centre) scored Chelsea's winner in their 2-1 victory over Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . Remy could be vital to Chelsea as they look to win the Premier League title after Diego Costa went off injured . That’s a goal every 91 minutes

"They share the bond of a grandfather and granddaughter, but in the 18 years they have known each other, have never actually met. Until now. When she was 11-years-old, New York girl Nicole - who asked that her surname not be published - was given a school assignment to write to a pen pal, with an ad placed in different newspapers calling for people in other states interested in corresponding with the students. Norman Fikes, a writer from Bastrop, Texas, came across the ad and responded, subsequently beginning an exchange that would - and continues to - last a lifetime. That was 1996, and Norman - then 61 - and his wife, Bobbie, started to eagerly await letters from their young pen pal, Nicole, KVUE TV reported. Finally: Nicole and Norman have been writing to each other for the last 18 years, but have only just met each other in the flesh in Batrop, Texas . First meal: The two decided to meet for dinner and share their first meal together. Both were in tears . Both would send photos in their letters and celebrate birthdays and holidays with each other from afar. One year Norman playfully told Nicole he wanted either a Cadillac or Rolls Royce for his birthday. Nicole then sent a toy car of each make. The couple witnessed Nicole grow up through her letters, and Norman has kept all of them, even a poem Nicole wrote for him when she was young. However, much to his dismay, Norman, now almost 80, was forced to stop writing back to Nicole recently, as his Parkinson's Disease worsens and his hands are too shaky to put pen to paper. Unwilling to be cut off from her surrogate grandparents, Nicole traveled the 1,600 miles from New York to Bastrop, to finally meet them. A reunion of sorts: Norman Fikes and his wife Bobbie (together) finally got to meet Nicole (center left) and her family, after Nicole traveled from New York to meet with the couple . Norman sat anxiously in the restaurant where they planned to meet. 'I'm so excited. I'm nervous,' he told KVUE TV. Then Nicole, now a 29-year-old woman, finally arrived. She ran in with tears streaming down her face and her arms outstretched. 'We made it,' she said. 'How are you? Can you believe it?' Norman was crying just as much. 'I've never had anybody go to this much trouble to see me before,' he said. Celebration: Together with their families, Nicole and Norman (back left) have now finally met . Once the tears stopped, the two shared their first proper conversation and meal. They have now agreed to speak over text, with Bobbie helping her husband type and read the messages. Nicole acknowledged that, with technology the way it is now, other children won't get to have an experience like she did. 'The connections you make are way more important than anything you're going to learn in a book,' she said.

"Mark Halsey, the controversial former elite referee who lost his role as a regular BT Sport pundit following Premier League upset, has had an invitation to speak to a regional referees association withdrawn following intervention from the highest level. Halsey was due to address the Sheffield Referee Association on how he beat cancer to continue as a top referee. But an objection from an unnamed football figure led to the national Referees Association persuading their Sheffield branch to embarrassingly cancel the appearance of Halsey, who was giving his services free. The email from Laura Ritchie, chairwoman of the RA, read: ‘A senior member of the footballing world has brought it to our attention that you have invited Mark Halsey to be a guest speaker. It is a worry that a figure who is being very negative about top-flight referees won’t send the right message to members. It may be perceived Sheffield RA agree with his viewpoint.’ Mark Halsey was invited to speak to the Sheffield Referee Association regarding his battle against cancer . However his planned appearance was cancelled after an unnamed football figure objected against the talk . Sheffield management then informed members: ‘There was an agreement that we cancel Mark after pressure from the national RA and the wider football world.’ And the Sheffield response to the RA said: ‘Our irritation at having been placed in this position cannot be underestimated. Are we saying that as referees, we are above criticism?’ FA refs chief David Elleray is president of the RA but on Monday night HE denied any involvement. However, Halsey’s strong views on a decline in refereeing standards is certainly born out by the widespread furore around their performances this season. BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore reacted to his perceived ‘snub’ at being one of the few TV pundits not included in ITV’s giant World Cup team by tweeting ‘I’ve been told I’m too controversial for TV World Cup coverage.

"Trendsetter: Natalie Massenet made Net-a-Porter a global phenomenon . When Natalie Massenet set up a website selling luxury fashions 15 years ago, her critics said it would never work. But that company, Net-a-Porter.com, proved to be a huge hit – with women saving up more than £2,000 for dresses by top designers such as Valentino. Now the online firm she founded from a London flat in 2000 is about to go through a mega-merger with an Italian fashion group – netting the mother of two about £70million. The deal with Yoox, expected to be announced this week after both sides confirmed talks yesterday, will make the business worth £1billion. It is a remarkable success story for UK-based Miss Massenet, who is credited with changing the way women shop for high-end fashion. Her website has become a global phenomenon, reaching sales of more than £500million and spawning copycat sites across the world. The daughter of a British Chanel model, the 49-year-old former fashion magazine journalist set up her online business just as the dotcom crash hit in 2000. Aged just 33 and struggling to get any funding, she eventually managed to raise just over a million in start-up capital from her Chelsea flat. She launched the business with her then husband Arnaud while pregnant with her first child, despite warnings from sceptics who thought women would refuse to buy expensive clothes without trying them on. But the site has been a huge hit with the wealthy as well as those who simply live a long way from London’s designer shops and save for months for an item. Top-end products on the site include a JW Anderson leather panelled mini dress for £1,350 and a black silk satin jacket by Givenchy for £2,675. Miss Massenet, who split from her husband in 2011 after 15 years of marriage, has since expanded the company into menswear with a site called Mr Porter and a discount site called the Outnet.com. She is due to receive the fruits of the mega-merger, which analysts say will bring a range of benefits, once the deal is finalised. She is expected to receive more than £70million on top of the £50million she made from selling the business to current owner, Swiss luxury giant Richemont, in 2010. That deal valued the business at £280million. The merger with Yoox, which sells overstocked or unsold designer goods from previous seasons, values it at a staggering £1billion. Catwalk creations: The latest clothing designs on the website . California-born Miss Massenet, who is currently the chairman of the British Fashion Council, may stay on in her role as chairman of the business. She worked for US magazine Women's Wear Daily and later became an assistant to stylist and fashion muse Isabella Blow at Tatler. Net-a-Porter is famous for its plush back and cream ribbon-wrapped delivery boxes, with designer items lovingly wrapped in crisp tissue paper. During the financial crisis women who were unable to give up their Net-a-Porter habit asked for their purchases to be delivered in plain wrapping, to hide their extravagance from colleagues.

"A Dutch mother has abducted two of her four children and taken them to join militants fighting for the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Syria. The unnamed 32-year-old Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa. The father of the missing children named the pair as Luca, seven, and his sister Aysha, eight, and said they had been taken without his consent. The woman's two other children are believed to have been handed over to a relative before she left to join the terror group. Abducted: The father of the missing children named the pair as 'Luca', seven, (left) and his sister 'Aysha', eight, (right) and said they had been taken without his consent . The missing woman, who has not yet been named, fled the Netherlands with two of her children last October, the Dutch prosecution's office confirmed this morning. Snatched: Eight-year-old Dutch girl 'Aysha' was abducted by her mother and taken to join ISIS . It is the first known instance of children in the Netherlands being abducted and taken to join ISIS. According to the Dutch newspaper De Limburger, the children's father had previously reported his estranged wife to the police because he was concerned she was planning to travel to Syria. Officers are said to have questioned the woman several times but she denied having intentions to join ISIS and investigators could find no evidence of concrete travel plans. Shortly afterwards the woman vanished from Maastricht with two of the children, prompting Dutch officials to launch a major alert, leading to an international arrest warrant being issued. Despite this the woman later took to Facebook to declare that she and her two children had arrived in the terrorists' de facto capital Raqqa, having used fake passports to travel across Europe. After making the announcement of their arrival in Raqqa on Facebook last October, nothing has been heard from the trio since. Dutch officials said they had no way of telling whether the group were still alive, with prosecutor Bart den Hartigh declaring the recovery of the children 'impossible' as the Netherlands has no legal relationship with either the Syrian regime or the terror group that controls the city of Raqqa. No place for children: The unnamed 32-year-old Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa (pictured) The news comes as an 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State. West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham, was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. It comes the day after it three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, in a dramatic security operation. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Istanbul

"Claims that Tiger Woods is serving a one-month suspension - rebutted by the player's agent and the PGA Tour - have been withdrawn. Woods is taking an indefinite break from golf as he attempts to get his game 'tournament ready' after a poor run of form and injuries. Former Tour player Dan Olsen, who played in 35 Tour events between 1989 and 2011 - missing 22 cuts - alleged in an interview on US radio station 730AM The Game on Friday that Woods was serving a drugs ban, but on Monday retracted his claims and issued an apology to the 14-time major winner. Dan Olsen had alleged in a radio interview that Tiger Woods (pictured) was serving a one month suspension . Olsen has since apologised to Woods and to the PGA Tour for the comments he made . 'I retract the entire interview,' Olsen said in a statement on the radio station's website. 'My comments were ill-advised. I want to apologise to Nike, the PGA Tour, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and (Tour commissioner) Tim Finchem.' The allegations had brought a strong denial from the PGA, with PGA Tour executive vice-president and chief marketing officer Ty Votaw issuing a statement. 'There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,' it read. 'We categorically deny these allegations.' Woods' agent Mark Steinberg also quashed the allegations, labelling them 'unequivocally and completely false'. 14-time major championship winner Woods, pictured here in June 2013 at Merion Golf Club, hopes to reclaim his world No 1 status from Rory McIlory when he returns to the sport . 'These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,' he said. 'They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. 'The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.' Woods has not played since he withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open at the start of February, less than a week after firing a career-worst round of 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. No date has been set for the 39-year-old's return, with the Masters at Augusta starting on April 9. Woods is currently dating USA skiing superstar Lindsey Vonn, with the pair pictured together here in 2013 . Woods is currently on a hiatus from golf in order to recover from injuries and a dip in his form .

"A morbidly obese man has started documenting his efforts to lose more than 300lbs - without weight loss surgery - after the intense back pain brought on by his size prompted him to get serious about his health. For years, Iowa-based writer Daniel P. Finney, ignored that at 563lbs he was severely overweight - even shrugging off strangers who called him 'fatty' as he walked down the street. But after a series of health issues, the 39-year-old became inspired to shed more than half of his body weight the natural way and chronicle his journey for The Des Moines Register. 'I know I'm responsible for my actions,' the columnist wrote for the newspaper's website. 'And I'm the only person who can really fix the problem.' Scroll down for video. Weight loss journey: Daniel P. Finney, 39, of Iowa, is sharing his efforts to lose over 300lbs; he started out weighing 563lbs and has lost 20lbs in a month . Daniel shared that he has been overweight since high school, and over the years has gotten used to the fact that he doesn't fit into seats at most public venues or booths at restaurants. As one of 79 million obese Americans, he has also become accustomed to the emotional pain of being called 'fatty' and getting verbally abused by strangers. In fact, even a diagnosis of Type II diabetes didn't alarm him enough to change his habits, and other health issues, like regularly pulling muscles in his calves, became a way of life. It wasn't until a combination of intense lower back pain - caused by carrying groceries, since Daniel said he can't carry anything that weighs much more than a magazine - and trouble sleeping led him to see a doctor. 'The pain had reached a point where I was practically immobile,' he said, adding that he could walk only 150 feet before he would have to stop. That's when an X-ray showed him that he also had arthritis and a narrowing of his spinal cavity. His doctor referred him to the Mercy Weight Loss Clinic in West Des Moines, Iowa. Now, Daniel is working with a therapist to tackle his emotional eating issues, as well as a nutritionist and a physical therapist. He also uses a calorie-counting app on his phone to track his eating, but admitted that even though he is serious about losing weight, making major lifestyle changes isn't easy. 'I don't know if I want to go through the rest of my life eating a leaf of kale and two scoops of vitamin supplements and sipping a thimble of water,' he said. 'The thought terrifies me of no more pizza, nachos, chicken wings, Mountain Dew or fries.' But he is still determined to try to lose over 300lbs the old-fashioned way, rather than go under the knife. If he chose to have gastric sleeve surgery, which makes the stomach smaller and reduces the hormones that produce cravings, he could lose as much as 60 per cent of his excess weight in a year - but Daniel said he

"A missing schoolgirl was murdered by a 60-year-old man who called police two weeks prior to the killing to see how officers would react to her disappearance, a jury heard today. Robert Ewing, 60, was said to have had an 'inappropriate sexual interest' in 15-year-old Paige Chivers and took advantage of her 'chaotic and dysfunctional' upbringing which had left her 'very troubled and vulnerable'. He is accused of murdering the schoolgirl, from Blackpool, Lancashire, between August 23 and August 27, 2007. Scroll down for video . Robert Ewing, 60, is accused of murdering 15-year-old Paige Chivers (pictured left as a young schoolgirl and right aged 15) after she disappeared from her family home in Blackpool, Lancashire, in August 2007 . Police investigate a site in Thornton Cleveleys in Lancashire during an earlier search for Paige's body . Paige was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home and, despite appeals from police and a £12,000 reward offer from TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle, no trace of her has ever been found. Ewing was arrested in connection with her disappearance in September last year and is currently on trial at Preston Crown Court. The jury was told today how he allegedly rang police anonymously less than a fortnight before she went missing to tell officers that a 'problem child' had turned up on his doorstep having been thrown out by her father. Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, told jurors that the Crown Prosecution Service believes he did so to 'test the water'. He told the court: 'We allege that he wanted to see what official reaction there would be to the suggestion of a 15-year-old girl turning up on the doorstep of a 52-year-old man and the answer he learned, we suggest, was very little reaction.' The court also heard how eight months after the schoolgirl's disappearance, Ewing's friend, Gareth Dewhurst, 46, was overheard in conversation saying he had used his car to dump the teenager's body. Mr Cummings said: 'He then went on to say: ""I didn't want to have sex with her, they made me"".' The prosecutor said a 'highly stoned' Dewhurst told a 16-year-old boy that Ewing had killed Paige and had then made him have sex with her before forcing him to use his car to dispose of her body. Mr Cummings said: 'He (Dewhurst) said that he had put the body in the boot and was saying that he was going to set his car on fire. He was frightened that he was going to get arrested, or that Bob (Ewing) would kill him.'

"(CNN)Just about now, North Korea's enigmatic ruler was expected to be preparing to emerge from his fortified country for a visit to Moscow to join celebrations next week marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. The trip was highly anticipated. After all, this was to have been Kim's first official international trip since he came to power in 2011 following his father's death, and it would have provided a fascinating opportunity for the world to get a closer look at a young leader and a regime still largely shrouded in mystery. But this week, Russia announced that the trip had been canceled, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Thursday that Moscow was informed via diplomatic channels that the trip would not happen. He said that ""the decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs."" What could have changed Kim's mind? It is practically impossible to answer the question with absolute certainty, but a possible explanation is that Kim may not be feeling completely secure in his position. And nervous dictators prefer to stay home. True, Kim runs one of the most brutally repressive regimes on Earth. And there is unceasing public praise for the younger 'Dear Leader,"" including frenzied eruptions of support. But these eruptions are carefully scripted, and those who have managed to flee the North confirm that in private, many are unhappy with the regime. Perhaps with the potential threats in mind, Kim feels the need to reassert his authority and keep his eye on the centers of power. In 2013, Kim shocked the country and stunned outside observers when he ordered the killing of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who had stood by his side from the day his father died. Jang had mentored and guided the young Kim as he took the reins, but the once-powerful Jang was arrested by soldiers during a Politburo meeting who dragged him away in a chilling scene broadcast on national television. The central news agency called Jang a ""traitor for all the ages,"" with vague accusations that he had behaved ""insolently."" More seriously, he was accused of ""counter-revolutionary factional acts in a bid to overthrow the leadership."" And just this week, and only a day before the Russians announced Kim's canceled travel plans, a South Korea lawmaker revealed that South Korea's National Intelligence Service had pieced together information suggesting that so far this year, Kim has ordered the execution of 15 senior government officials. According to South Korean legislator Shing Kyung-min, North Korea's vice chairman of the State Planning Commission, for example, was executed because he objected to plans to change the design of a new government hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower. Such an explanation is bizarre. And in keeping with the odd behavior we have grown accustomed to hearing about from North Korea. But there may be more to this. Kim -- who was still in his 20s when he took power and holds a host of titles, including Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army -- still finds it

"Child benefit could be limited to only three children, under plans being considered by the Tories. The proposals will only hit babies born after the law has been changed and could save the Government £300million a year. At the moment there are around 320,000 families with four or more children. The Chancellor George Osborne is resisting proposals from the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to cap child benefit at three children . Child benefit is paid to families with children under 16 – or under 20 if they are in education or training. But since 2013 families with one parent earning more than £50,000 a year have been excluded from claiming the benefit. It currently pays £20.50 a week for a first child, then £13.55 for other children. James Browne, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the move would eventually save hundreds of millions of pounds – but not for another 18 years because it only affects babies born after the law is changed. Child benefit is paid families with children under 16 - or under 20 if they are in education or training - and is worth £20.50 a week for a first child, then £13.55 for other children. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has previously proposed a two-child limit, but George Osborne is understood to have rejected it. The Treasury is now ‘softening’ to the idea and is examining the details. Tory MP Dominic Raab said it was not purely about cost but could ‘send a message about personal responsibility’. He said: ‘There is a much broader point than just the financial bean counting,’ he said. ‘It's the kind of welfare system we want - do we want a social safety net or are we saying that welfare is somehow a lifestyle choice? ‘And I think we do want the welfare system to send a message about personal responsibility, and yes that includes parents saving and taking some responsibility for the size of their family, making sure it's according to their means.’ But Labour MP Dame Anne Begg said people did not have children for child benefit and asked ‘why pick on’ large families. She said: ‘I don't think you have a child because you're going to get an extra... £13.55 a week.’ Dame Anne added: ‘Only one in seven families have three or more children - it's a small number - so why pick on them?’

As Rebecca Cross and her Scottish terrier Knopa were handed the trophy at the prestigious dog show, the suited man charged in front of the winning pair, holding aloft a sign which read 'Mutts Against Crufts'.

The Roys hope by sharing the experience they would inspire other same sex couples to start a family. Melanie added: 'The woman's body is incredible. The way it creates and grows another human being is amazing. We hope that our picture is that sign that some women may need to encourage them to carry a child.'

"An Iditarod sled dog who escaped from handlers in Anchorage has been found safe after being on the run for a month. Alaskan Husky, Sarabi, was returned to a friend of the musher Laura Allaway, on Monday night who will be reunited with the animal on April 28 when she returns from traveling. The three-year-old dog was spotted on April 15 near Glenn Highway and then again last Friday near Reverend Tim Carrick's United Protestant Presbyterian Church before being caught on Monday night, according to KTUU. Carrick and his family set up a cage trap in the woods between the church and his home, and used four bowls of dog kibbles, a pot of chicken stock, liverwurst and a motion activated camera to help capture Sarabi. Idiatrod sled dog Sarabi escaped from handlers in Anchorage but has been found safe a month after running away (Sarabi pictured above) Sarabi was dropped from musher Laura Allaway's team (Allaway pictured left) during the Iditarod on March 21. The three-year-old dog was then seen near Glenn Highway around April 15 before being spotted in Palmer . 'I was pretty sure that she wasn't around anymore after three weeks of no confirmed sighting,' Allaway told ABC News. Sarabi escaped from handlers on March 21 after being dropped by musher Allaway's team during the Iditarod race. The animal was then seen near Glenn Highway around April 15, and then in Palmer, about 40 miles northeast of Anchorage. After Sarabi was spotted in near Carrick's home and the church in Palmer, searchers asked him for help. She was seen on video eating the food in the cage trap before it was decided on the evening of April 20 to capture her, and the trap was closed on Monday night. 'This morning when I got up, she was all the way inside the cage and licking the back' Carrick told KTUU on Monday. 'One of the ladies had put some liverwurst or something in the back of the cage so she would get more comfortable with going in'. Rev. Tim Carrick set up a cage trap in the woods between his home and the church and placed inside over a course of a few days four bowls of dog kibbles, a pot of chicken stock and liverwurst (above the trap) On Facebook Allaway wrote on Tuesday thanking everyone for their help in bringing Sarabi back home to Fairbanks (above) 'I'm kind of sad to see her go in a way, but really happy she's going to be back with Laura', Carrick continued. Morgan Hall, a friend of Allaway's picked up Sarabi on Monday around 9pm and took her to a kennel where Allaway works in Fairbanks. 'We got her. We got her safe. She'll be home safe,' Hall told the Alaska Dispatch News on Monday night. 'That's all that matters.'

"Teenagers as young as 16 in Birmingham have undergone weight loss surgery (file picture) Obese teenagers as young as 16 have had NHS-funded gastric band operations, worrying new figures show. And in a four-year period, the number of people aged under 30 receiving weight loss surgery in Birmingham more than doubled. Gastric band and gastric bypass operations are only carried out on the NHS when a patient's life is deemed to be at risk. Such surgery is a last resort, and before it is considered a patient is asked to make drastic changes to their lifestyle to try and lose weight naturally. The guidelines are such that a 5ft 5ins child will not be considered eligible for the drastic procedure unless they weigh at least 15 stone. Meanwhile someone who is 5ft 8ins would need to weigh almost 17 stone before they can be given the go-ahead for surgery. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre released under the Freedom of Information Act show in the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery. These included two 16 year olds, two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds. Overall between 2008-09 and 2011-12 the numbers of the radical operations performed on the under 30s rose from 35 to 71 - a 102 per cent increase. It comes as new figures this weekend revealed hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year. Since 2011, 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese - weighing 9lb 15oz or more, a Freedom of Information request revealed. Last year it emerged that West Midlanders are the second fattest group in the whole country, with NHS England figures revealing 65.7 per cent of people are overweight or obese. New figures released in January this year highlighted the worrying news that almost four out of 10 children in Birmingham are officially classed as overweight or obese by the age of 11. Concerns have been raised that people are opting for stomach surgery as an 'easy option' rather than go to the trouble of changing their lifestyle, eating more healthily and taking exercise. NHS guidelines state that surgery can only be offered when the patient has 'life threatening obesity' - a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above, or a BMI of 35 with other serious health conditions that could be improved through weight loss, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. The policy states: 'It is always recommended that patients try to lose weight through a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and increased exercise before you consider weight loss surgery, as surgery carries a risk of complications and requires a significant change in lifestyle afterwards. 'Due to these associated risks, most surgeons, whether they are working privately or for the NHS, would only consider a person for surgery if there was a clinical need, and not just for cosmetic reasons.' People can also opt to pay for weight loss surgery privately. A gastric band operation, which reduces the size of the stomach, costs up to £8,000. Meanwhile, a full

"A New York man who became known as the 'Cannibal Cop' wants to give the public a taste of what's really going on inside his mind. In the HBO documentary Thought Crimes which premiered on Thursday at Tribeca Film Festival, Valle talks about his 2012 arrest and the claims that allegedly plotted to kidnap, torture, and eat his wife and other women online. For those hungry to learn about Valle and his stomach-churning fantasies, the film will also be shown on HBO in May. Scroll down for video . Thought Crimes :In the HBO documentary Thought Crimes 'cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle talks about his 2012 arrest and the claims that allegedly plotted to kidnap, torture, and eat women online . Family time: Gilberto Valle, often at his mother's house, is seen cooking in the film but he's only making bacon and eggs and he makes jokes about people feeling afraid when they see him with a fork . Months before his arrest in late 2012, Gilberto Valle, then a New York police officer, sat at his computer, hiding behind fictional online identities and exchanging messages about murdering and eating women . 'When you’re behind a computer screen late at night, no one knows who you are, where you are,' Valle says in the opening of the documentary. 'I became part of this cyber-community, where people are exploring deviant thoughts and exploring their fetishes,' he added. 'And then you shut the computer off, and that’s it. I go back to being the regular me. But someone might say the anonymous nature could also bring out who you really are. In my worst nightmare, I could never guess that this would have happened.' Valle, often at his mother's house, is seen cooking in the film but he's only making bacon and eggs. 'Nobody’s alarmed I have a fork in my hand with people around? Everybody's good?' Valle asks at one point when sitting down to eat. Valle insists throughout the film that he never intended to actually hurt anyone. He says he just has dark fantasies. 'This was something that was private, anonymous, it was a little bit of a skeleton in my closet,' Valle says, brushing off his dark thoughts. The New York Daily News reports that the director of the film Erin Lee Carr said that she wanted to portray Valle in as neutral of a light as possible. Originally convicted: Former New York City police officer Gilberto Valle, dubbed by local media as the 'Cannibal Cop' after a guilty verdict was delivered at his trial as seen in this courtroom sketch . 'He wanted me to paint a portrait of him as an American family man and I couldn’t do that,' Carr said. 'I could portray him as someone you could try and understand.' Carr is the daughter of New York Times columnist David Carr who died in February. In the film Valle's father, Gilberto Valle Sr., says his son was guilty of being an imaginative writer. 'He created a monster. He’s a good writer,' he says. At the end of

"A primary school teaching assistant has been suspended after a colleague discovered white powder in her bag and reported it to the police. It has been reported that Lisa Heath, 45, an assistant at Willowtown Community Primary School in Gwent, had been carrying Class B amphetamines after police were called and quizzed her. She initially denied the drugs were hers, saying they had been planted on her, but later changed her story, accepting a caution for possession. Lisa Heath, 45, an assistant at Willowtown Community Primary School, Gwent (pictured), admitted carrying a Class B drug on the premises and has now been suspended from teaching . A spokesman for the school told The Sun that Miss Heath had been suspended, adding that she was being dealt with 'through the appropriate internal channels.' Gwent Police confirmed its officers were called to the school in Ebbw Vale on March 19 after receiving reports a controlled substance had been discovered on the premises. A police spokesperson added: 'A 45 year old woman voluntarily attended Tredegar Police Station where she received a caution for possession of a controlled substance (class B).' Blaenau Gwent Council has confirmed that the school immediately suspended the member of staff following the incident. A spokeswoman for the local authority said: 'We take such incidents extremely seriously and this matter is now being dealt with by the school and its governing body, together with support from the council, through the proper internal procedures. We are unable to comment further.' The maximum penalty for possession of amphetamines is 5 years in prison plus a fine. For supply the penalty is up to 14 years imprisonment and a fine. If the amphetamines are prepared for injection they become class A drugs and increased penalties apply. There is no indication this was the case with Ms Heath. When a reporter from the paper went to Ms Heath's home, a man claiming to be her son emerged and denied that she had been suspended or found with drugs. Most amphetamines (pictured), a form of chemical stimulant, are Class B drugs, meaning the maximum penalty for possession is five years in jail plus a fine . He also threatened to attack anyone going near the property with a hammer. Willowtown has 379 pupils aged between three and 11 years old, with 15 full-time members of staff, supported by four part-time teachers. Ebbw Vale, the area in which the school is located, is among the most deprived in Wales, and a third of the pupils qualify for free school meals, above the Welsh average of around 20 per cent.

"(CNN)All you need is luck, to misquote one of Liverpool's most famous exports, The Beatles. But Liverpool's footballers won't mind one bit that a fortunate goal sealed a vital win at Swansea to set up a pivotal clash with Manchester United at the weekend. One of English soccer's biggest rivalries is renewed on Sunday with vital points at stake in the race for a place in next season's European Champions League. Jordan Henderson knew little about his winner in Wales, the ball flying in after Jordi Amat's clearance struck him, but it helped make it seven wins out of eight for the Reds. A sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home pulled it within two points of Manchester United in fourth, with just four points separating Liverpool from Manchester City in second. ""It's a great result,"" Henderson told Sky Sports. ""The first half was disappointing but I felt as though we did better in second half, passed the ball and created a few chances. ""It was a great pass by Daniel, I got a little fortunate with the finish but you've got to be in the right position to score. ""Overall we're delighted with three points and we now look forward to Sunday. We can't wait for it, we are high on confidence and have great momentum but United played well the other day. ""It'll be a tough one but at Anfield we go in confident and hopefully we'll get the result we need."" In a lackluster start, Daniel Sturridge dragged a shot wide of post for Liverpool before England international Adam Lallana fired a fierce half-volley right at Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. From then on Swansea asserted control. Martin Skrtel had to be alert to clear as Swansea's French striker Bafetimbi Gomis -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at Tottenham earlier this month -- headed at goal. Gomis then played a neat one-two with Wayne Routledge before forcing Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet into a fine low save. Next to threaten Liverpool's net was Iceland international Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose effort was arrowing for the top corner before Mignolet intervened. Just before halftime Jonjo Shelvey, a former Liverpool player, went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by Alberto Moreno. But having had a chance to regroup, Liverpool came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot. First Fabianski made a brilliant save to keep out Philippe Coutinho's near post effort before the Pole was then in action again to deny Joe Allen. Though Liverpool were in the ascendency, its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck. As Henderson galloped onto a through ball Swansea's Spanish defender Amat got there first, but his clearance ricocheted off the Liverpool player and into the net past Fabianski. From then on Liverpool did a fine job of squeezing the life out of the game and playing on the counter, striker Daniel Sturridge hitting the post late on as Swansea left gaps at the back.

"Celtic have announced that they are to erect a bronze statue of Billy McNeill to mark the magnificent achievements of the club's greatest ever captain. The statue will be positioned on the recently opened Celtic Way and will represent a man who is synonymous with the club and someone who represented them with true distinction as both a player and manager. As a player, McNeill won nine consecutive league championship titles, seven Scottish Cups, six League Cups and, of course, he was the first British team captain to lift the European Cup in 1967. Celtic legend BIlly McNeill poses with the European Cup to commemorate the club's famous 1967 victory . He was named the Scottish Footballer of the Year in season 1964-65, the first ever winner of the award. As manager, McNeill delivered four league championship titles, three Scottish Cups and he lifted the League Cup once. As both player and manager, he enjoyed a 27-year association with Celtic Football Club. Fittingly, the work on the statue will be carried out by John McKenna, the sculptor who recently completed the statue of Jock Stein which sits at the entrance to Celtic Park. Work on the statue of McNeill will begin immediately and it is hoped that the completed work will be unveiled at Celtic Park later this year, around Autumn. McNeill (right) has a shot blocked by Leeds United midfielder Paul Madeley (left) Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell said: 'Growing up in the 1960s and 1970s as a Celtic supporter, Billy McNeill was an inspiration to me and someone of huge stature in the game, not only on the field but also off it, as a statesman, a leader and a figurehead for our great club. 'His achievements for Celtic are simply outstanding and across a period of 27 years he gave so much to the club. 'It is a privilege to now know Billy, and consider him as a friend. He is someone who commands the respect of everyone across the entire footballing spectrum. 'We are delighted already to have Billy as our Ambassador at the club but the Board felt unanimously that he should recognised in this way, given all that he has contributed to Celtic over so many years. 'We look forward to the unveiling of the statue, which we are sure will be a great tribute to a great man.' McNeill himself said: 'When Peter contacted me regarding the statue I was completely taken by surprise. 'Whenever I walk up the Celtic Way, I look on with a great sense of pride at the sight of Brother Walfrid, Big Jock and my old team-mate and friend Jinky rightly taking their place almost as guardians of Celtic Park. 'Every time I look back at this special club's history and what we achieved it fills me with joy, and now to be told I am to be honoured beside these Celtic greats, this really is a special day for me and all my family.'

"A driver has been arrested after a £200,000 supercar was allegedly spotted driving at 150mph on the M25. The black and white Ferrari California was pulled over by two police cars last night on the busy motorway near Woking, Surrey. The car has been seized by police while a man, aged 25, was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and has since been bailed. Surrey Police tweeted this message last night after this Ferrari California was alleged seen doing 150mph . The car was allegedly seen doing the high speeds between junctions 8 and 10 of the M25 in Surrey . Officers say the high-performance vehicle, the first model of which was released in 2008, was seen doing 150mph between junctions eight, near Reigate, and junction 10, near Woking. The police force tweeted a photo of the car alongside the message: '#M25 J8-10 Ferrari California 150mph with two police cars behind. Vehicle seized and driver arrested.' The force later revealed it had 'numerous calls' about the car and responded within three minutes. It is believed the police cars which pulled over the Ferrari were BMW 530s, which a police source described as 'pretty nifty, if not as fast as a Ferrari'. The Italian-made vehicle appears to have a personalised number plate and red interior. Other motorists on Twitter expressed shock that the vehicle managed to reach such speeds on a road famous for its heavy traffic. Dawn Denyer tweeted: 'I'm normally lucky to get to 60mph on that stretch. Is that what the new variable speed signs are for?' The car is built at the famous manufacturer's plant in Maranello, Italy and does 0-60 in less than four seconds . Motorists expressed shock at claims the car could reach such speeds on the road known for heavy traffic . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

"It's not time to play the music. For Lewis Hamilton has said the building of his ‘brand’ after Formula One — possibly in a recording studio — must not cloud his determination to win a third world championship. Hamilton has been a regular at showbusiness events in the close season, but now his red private jet has touched down in Melbourne and his focus has switched to the defence of his title in the opening race of the campaign. Nonetheless, his life is something of a juggling act. Yes, winning races is by far the most important thing, yet he has engaged transatlantic PR and talent agencies to polish his image after a split from Simon Fuller, who shaped ‘Brand Beckham’. Lewis Hamilton wants to replicate the scenes that followed after his second world championship title . Hamilton (left) has been pictured alongside Kanye West and Kim Kardashian since his triumph . Hamilton is adamant his growing profile will not distract him from matters on the racing track . Hamilton has never hidden his passion for music, posting Instagram snaps playing guitar . Is that ‘brand’ something Hamilton wants to replicate? ‘At the moment, it’s winning championships that counts,’ he said. ‘I don’t wish to stop racing but I’m conscious I’m halfway through my career, or maybe gone past halfway, and that the next six, seven or however many years I get will come and go. Whatever steps I take now will determine what I do after. ‘I don’t want to be a commentator, although I think I’d be OK at it because I obviously know a lot about the sport, but there are other things I would like to try. So it’s exploring those and building a foundation.’ Does that mean music? ‘I’m continuing to plod along and enjoy my music when I get time,’ said Hamilton. ‘But I haven’t been in the studio since January, and just for a couple of days. That’s the least music I’ve done during a winter for some time. ‘Music is more of my life than people are aware of. When you’re doing music you have a choice of how much you want to show and how vulnerable you want to be. I approach it just as a hobby, something I enjoy. It’s therapeutic. ‘I like to have feedback from people who are experienced. I’ve never been tempted to release anything but I’ve not had the worst of comments about my songs, either.’ Hamilton has spoken about several post-career avenues, including an acting role in Hollywood.

"Nick Scholfield is lined up to ride Spring Heeled in the Grand National at Aintree on April 11 . Nick Scholfield has been lined up to ride Jim Culloty’s Spring Heeled in the Crabbie’s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week. Scholfield had been expected to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Sam Winner, who was pulled up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in the £1million race. But the champion trainer said on Wednesday it was unfair to tie Scholfield down to a gelding which is far from certain to run when the mount on another leading definite contender is being offered. Scholfield, who has ridden in six Nationals and finished third in 2013 on Teaforthree, will travel to Ireland to sit on Spring Heeled at Culloty’s County Cork stable on Friday. Nicholls said: ‘I have not made up my mind if I am going to run Sam Winner yet and Nick needed a decision. ‘I did not want to get into a situation next week when I had to say ""sorry mate, he is not running"" and did not want to stop him getting a good ride. ‘I have not pressed any buttons on any of the horses who ran at Cheltenham. That will happen over the weekend and early next week. I don’t want to run unless I am really happy. ‘I have plenty of other lads who could ride Sam Winner if he runs and would not be afraid to use Will Biddick or Harry Skelton.’ Spring Heeled (right) wins the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at Cheltenham last year . Spring Heeled, winner of Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at last season’s Cheltenham Festival, has been given a National preparation. The eight-year-old has run only once since finishing fourth to Road To Riches in the Galway Plate in July when he was fourth of five in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February. Racemail revealed on Wednesday that Culloty would have two runners in the National. Robbie McNamara will ride his 2014 Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere. Scholfield rides Teaforthree (front) as the horse jumps the last fence at Aintree in the 2013 Grand National . McNamara said: ‘It's a great ride to get and I'm looking forward to it. I've ridden him before in a Grade One in Leopardstown and I was supposed to ride him in the Hennessy there as well, but I broke my collarbone the day before. I'm delighted to get back on him.’ With Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Double Ross another confirmed non runner, David Pipe’s well supported Soll appears guaranteed a run at the bottom of the weights. Luke Morris became the first jockey to ride 100 winners during an All Weather Flat racing season when a double at Chelmsford on Wednesday aboard Giantouch and Middle East Pearl carried him to 101 successes for the campaign.

"The trend for fresh, local, unprocessed foods could be putting people at risk if they opt to drink raw milk. This is according to a new study that claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill than the pasteurised version. Raw milk is associated with more than half of all milk-related food borne illnesses, even though only an estimated 3.5 per cent of the population in the US drink it. Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. Advocates believe it is s healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. But a new study claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill . Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. All fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised – heated to 72C (162F) for 25 seconds. As well as killing E.coli, the process also eliminates campylobacter, salmonella and listeria. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs. Advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. They also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma, hay fever and food allergies in children. But US tests have shown that the nutrients in raw and pasteurised milk are the same. Advocates believe that raw milk, which contains more natural antibodies, proteins, and bacteria than pasteurised milk, is healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. They argue pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. But the new study shows the risks are better understood than the benefits and that more research is needed to prove that the health claims are legitimate. They claim it can put people at risk of microbial contaminants commonly found in milk including infectious Salmonella, Campylobacter,and Listeria species along with the most dangerous form of E. coli. These bacteria can cause foodborne illness in humans, including diarrhea, vomiting, cramping, fevers, and sometimes more serious consequences such as kidney failure or death. 'The risks of consuming raw milk instead of pasteurised milk are well-established in the scientific literature and in some cases can have severe or even fatal consequences,' says Cissy Li, a graduate student in environmental health sciences at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 'Based on our findings, we discourage the consumption of raw milk, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, people with impaired immune systems, pregnant women, and children.' Pasteurisation involves heating milk to destroy microbes in the milk supply from fecal contamination, dairy operations, cow udders, or other sources. Treated milk is hermetically sealed to prevent recontamination. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may also contain these bugs .

"Real Madrid will need to play with intensity for 90 minutes and not just the first half if they are to have a chance of beating Barcelona in Sunday's La Liga 'Clasico', according to Real coach Carlo Ancelotti. Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.' Real have the rest of the week to prepare for Sunday's showdown at Barca, who take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday.

"(CNN)I can't remember exactly when my teenage fascination with computers collided with the federal government, but I will never forget the morning in 1983 when two FBI agents showed up on my parents' doorstep. I had gone to bed around 4 or 5 a.m. after spending hours on my computer, which was pretty common for me back then, at age 18. A few hours later, my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business. I had a slight fear this day would come, because only a couple of days earlier, I had a strange call from a friend asking me what I would do if we were visited by the police or some type of investigation team. Two men sitting at my kitchen table pulled out badges and stated they were with the FBI. They said they needed to talk to me. Let me start with a little history: I got my first taste of computers in the mid-1970s in junior high school. We had a teletype terminal that had been brought to our school with an acoustic modem attached. We were shown how it worked and some of us had a chance to do some math testing. I did not get to use it the first time, but I stayed after school that evening to see if I could get a chance to try it out. The teacher dialed into the central office computer, logged in and started the math program. I felt like a new world opened for me. For the first time in my life, I saw something that made me imagine what I wanted to do when I grew up. That junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school. There, I learned of an Explorer Scout group sponsored by IBM. For the next couple of years I built a friendship with a group of people who had interests similar to mine -- some closer than others. We would play with computers at school, in Explorer Scouts, in stores like Radio Shack and at home. Finally in 1982, I bought my first computer. Some of my friends already had computers and now my time came and I finally got my own. I purchased a Heathkit H-89, which we built in a friend's basement. At the same time I also bought a Hayes 309 baud Smartmodem. I used my computer and modem to log onto electronic bulletin board systems, or BBS, and create more friendships and acquaintances. We were a curious group and we were eager to learn more and more about the different computers made and how they worked. We ended up getting into about a dozen computer systems -- from the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to a major international bank system in Los Angeles to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, one of only two U.S. laboratories dedicated to nuclear weapons research. We were really just looking

The Belgian striker, back to form under manager Tim Sherwood with eight goals in six games, said his side must continue to stretch their lead over the drop zone.

Benteke thinks it would be risky to think that one more win will be enough to ensure survival . ‘Liverpool are a good team but the thing with the FA Cup is it's still something special. It's 50-50 for me but some will say they are favourites. ‘Wembley is something good and special because it's a semi final, it's close to the final and we have to do everything to be there again.’ Benteke believes his partnership with Gabby Agbonalhor can destroy defences. He added: ‘He (Sherwood) said to the team we have to play to our strengths, to play with me and Gabby. ‘He helped me to destroy the defenders, with two we're always better than one. I'm comfortable, it's a good partnership.’

A dazzling free-kick by David Alaba on the stroke of halftime and Mario Gotze's solo effort in the 57th minute were enough for Bayern, who were in control but never needed to hit top form against their toothless visitors. The Bavarians, top of the Bundesliga and chasing another domestic double, were up against a gutsy Braunschweig defence, with winger Franck Ribery frustrated in the first half by Braunschweig's physical play.

Arjen Robben, however, was lucky to be awarded a foul in the 45th minute with minimal contact by the Braunschweig player but it mattered little for Austria international Alaba, who unleashed a ferocious free kick into the top corner. Gotze killed off opposition hopes of a comeback early in the second half before Bayern stepped off the gas, content to protect their lead.

Werder captain Clemens Fritz, who was sent off near the end following a second booking, pulled one back but Junglas made sure it was a memorable evening for the former Bundesliga club when he finished off a quick break.

It is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from World War Two never to be found and has captivated treasure hunters ever since it was first plundered.

'As the Red Army closed in on Koenigsberg, he ordered the treasure to be packed up and brought back to his hometown. We have studied records and spoken to people from the time.

"Forget switchblades it's shears that will be the new weapon of choice for members of New Zealand's notorious Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs who are set to take up a new community initiative. The New Zealand Herald reports that in July the council of Dunedin City, on the South Island's east coast, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work - such as mowing lawns, trimming hedges, and cutting back foliage. Both the Mongrel Mob and Black Power have shared a violent rivalry spanning decades. The gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder, and robbery - but last year the gangs surprised everyone by suddenly making peace, not war. The council of Dunedin City, on New Zealand's South Island, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work . It's a very different kind of work than they're used to, but the gangs have joined forces in a submission to the Dunedin City Council, asking for help in acquiring paid work to support their families. 'It's remarkable they're working together. They've had a long history of just shooting each other,' Dunedin Mayor Dave Cull said. 'But I think they're both beginning to realise that violence won't provide them much of a future anymore.' Rather than shoot and knife each other the proposal was put forward for them to work together as an employment solution for gang members who were struggling to support their families, and steer them from a life of crime. The Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder and robbery . Mayor Cull explained that as the men approach middle age they've found their reputation and appearance have prevented them from finding traditional and regular employment. In response to concerns that work is being spoon-fed to gang members and that there are others more deserving of the chance, the Dunedin City Council said it will ensure that both Mongrel Mob and Black Power have to meet standard expectations. This includes meeting state health and safety requirements and providing insurance cover like any other commercial landscaping company.

"A New York mother claims her daughter was left partially paralyzed by a marijuana-infused brownie she bought at her high school. Danieel Buchanan, 17, was sold the snack by a classmate at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn on February 27, thinking its ingredients were innocent. But the teenager started to feel sick soon after and went to the school nurse with a racing heart rate and high blood pressure. Scroll down for video . Concern: Danieel Buchanan, 17, was sold a pot brownie at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn. She fell sick soon after and her mother claims she has been partially paralyzed ever since . The school then called her mother Allison at 11am to say they were taking her daughter to the emergency room at Brooklyn Hospital. After an initial check-up she was released into her parents' care - but her condition started to dramatically deteriorate. Her mother told PIX 11 she couldn't walk by herself, could barely eat and could only handle a few sips of tea at a time. At 3am the next morning, she took the youngster to Beth Israel in Manhattan, but was quickly transferred to nearby Mount Sinai. Her mother says when Danieel arrived she began convulsing and has been partially-paralyzed ever since. 'She’s not able to walk. She can’t stand. She can’t sit up,' Mrs Buchanan told the station.

"(CNN)When ISIS overran their villages near Mosul in August 2014, a small group of Assyrians, a Middle Eastern minority with a history reaching back more than 4,000 years, picked up weapons and formed their own militia: Dwekh Nawsha -- ""The Sacrificers."" Assyrians belong to the rapidly dwindling Christian population of Iraq -- recent estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq put the number as low as 300,000 compared with 1.5 million 20 years ago -- and many among them see the fight with ISIS as a final battle for survival against the Islamists. ""'Ah, Assyrians -- I've read about them in the Bible,' is what many people say,"" says Marcus Naissan, a 25-year-old electrical technician and member of Dwekh Nawsha. ""But we are not just history, we are still alive, we are still here."" The exodus of Christians from Iraq started prior to ISIS -- and the civil war in the mid-2000s took an especially heavy toll. Today, most Iraqi Christians live in Kurdish areas in the north, which have been a relative haven of stability. And so far, the Kurds have been taking heavy losses to defend Christian and Yezidi minorities against ISIS. Every night, the fighters hear the rumbling sound of coalition airplanes in the sky over Baqufa where they have their safe house just a few miles from the frontline. Here they relax, patrol the empty streets of the village and try to hinder ISIS suicide commandos from entering the near city of Dohuk where UNHCR says almost 100,000 refugees -- many of them Christians -- have found a temporary place to stay. So far, the militia has only assembled and trained 40 fighters. But Rama Baito, manager of the digital media presence of the group, shows me his direct messages on Facebook -- dozens of ex-soldiers, diaspora Assyrians or Christian activists from all over the world contact him and offer monetary support or their own presence on the frontline. ""We have 200 people waiting right now, because we simply do not have enough weapons and training capacities,"" Baito says. Since they are still small and have no heavy weaponry, the Dwekh Nawsha fighters say they coordinate closely with local Kurdish Peshmerga commanders and share the same foxholes on the frontline. The fighters are a very mixed bunch. A young baker, carrying his large military dagger in an elegant sheath, says he brought his father when he enlisted. ""But now, we see each other only rarely because he is in another unit of our group,"" he says. ""When I go on vacation, he goes to the field and the other way around. So every time we swap units, I wait for him, give him a quick hug and then leave back home."" Right now, ISIS is focused on other fronts -- the yellow fields of the Niniveh plains are quite safe for the mostly young fighters. But none of them thinks victory over ISIS will be quick, nor that fighting will end immediately afterward. All they can do now is patrol the deserted alleys of

"An airport worker has been awarded $40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago. Brandon Afoa, 33, of Puyallup, Washington, was operating a tug to push aircraft at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when the brakes and steering failed, causing him to crash into a luggage lift. The incident, which took place at 2am on December 26, 2007, left Afoa unable to use his legs or right arm. Much of his intestinal tract also had to be removed by surgeons. Afoa went on to sue Port of Seattle - which owns and operates the Sea-Tac airport - in King County Superior Court, saying that the company failed to maintain a safe workplace. Closure: An airport worker has been awarded $40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago . But for years the case was locked in the courts because the Port of Seattle claimed it wasn't liable for what happened as Afoa worked for a private firm. In a bid to move things forward, the state supreme court finally ruled in 2013 that the airport had a 'duty' to provide a safe working environment. On Tuesday a King County jury awarded Afoa $40 million because of what the incident has done to his life. Indeed, the paraplegic needs round-the-clock help from caregivers just to survive. In the courtroom a panel was shown video footage of Afoa being craned from his bed by a special lift to a commode and undergoing therapy. Jurors went on to apportion 25per cent of the blame for the accident to the Port of Seattle. Meanwhile, a number of airlines which weren’t part of the lawsuit will pay the rest of the money owed. This is because they had contracts with Afoa's previous employer - Evergreen Aviation Ground Logistics Enterprises - which has since gone out of business. Commenting on the outcome, Afoa told KOMO-TV: 'It was a relief and I'm very thankful for the jury for making an awesome decision.' In a statement, the Port of Seattle expressed its sympathies to Afoa and his family for the accident. The agency says it's reviewing the decision. If it decides to appeal the verdict, it could delay payment of Afoa's award.

"These are the photographs the Los Angeles Police Department claims prove that a homeless man they killed yesterday was trying to take an officer's gun away. A frame from an onlooker's video shows the man grabbing at an officer's waistband, police say, while a close-up of the weapon in question apparently shows damage caused by the scuffle. At least three officers opened fire on the man after he allegedly reached for the gun during the violent midday encounter on Skid Row. The man's name is thought to have been Booth, but he is known locally as 'Africa' and 'Cameroon' in reference to his African heritage. Scroll down for video . Proof?

The police department displayed a host of photographs which they think vindicates their officers at a new conference today . Los Angeles police chief Charlie Beck showed off the images at a news conference, recorded by local channel ABC7, 24 hours after the confrontation. He claimed the images showed that the magazine and slide of the officer's pistol were damaged - and that a bullet had been partially discharged from the chamber. Beck said: 'While on the ground and struggling with the officers the man forcibly grabbed on of the officers' holstered pistols, resulting in an officer involved shooting. 'Photos of the officer's pistol are on my right. As you can see, the slide is partially engaged and a round had been partially ejected and has fouled the firing chamber. 'This is indicative of a struggle over the weapon. As you can also see, the magazine is dislodged from its resting-place. This is also idnicative of force used on a weapon.

Drop the gun!' can be heard seconds before officers open fire on the prone man.

"A 71-year-old artist from Connecticut was shot to death Tuesday at the hands of her husband, who then turned the gun on himself, according to police. Terry Oakes Bourret was discovered dead from a gunshot wound to the head inside the Durham home she shared with her husband, 74-year-old Donald Bourret, who was also found unresponsive. The couple's pet dog had been shot to death outside the house. Double tragedy: Police in Connecticut say Donald Bourret (left), 74, shot dead his wife, local artist Terry Oakes Bourret (pictured right with her dog Murphy), 71, and their pet before turning the gun on himself . What lies beneath: The elderly married couple were found suffering from fatal gunshot wounds to the head in their Durham, Connecticut, home Tuesday . The medical examiner's office ruled Oakes Bourret's death a homicide and that of her husband a suicide, reported WFSB. State troopers responded to the Bourrets' home at 73 Main Street in Durham at around 7.30pm Tuesday after getting a 911 call about two bodies found inside the residence. Career change: The 71-year-old retired nurse took up painting full time about 30 years ago and set up a studio at the back of her house . Oakes Bourret was a retired nurse-turned painter and art teacher whose works have been exhibited throughout Connecticut. The 71-year-artist took up painting full time about 30 years ago and set up a studio at the back of her house, where students of all ages would come for classes. Her artworks, 300 of them displayed on her website, depict bright and cheerful landscapes, everyday scenes from around Durham, florals and pets. Last year, she won the Connecticut Plein Air Painters Society Gold Medal for a painting titled Sidewalk, adding to her collection of some 100 awards, according to Durham Town Times. Hartford Courant reported Donald Bourret was a retiree who wrote a movie review column for the Durham Library. His final review was of the critically acclaimed thriller Nightcrawler starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a sociopathic cameraman obsessed with grisly crimes.

"At last it’s on. Not only the Fight of the Century but the sale of tickets for Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao. The desert storm in a box office which some thought might pull the plug on the richest fight of all time has blown over. Those priceless tickets will be on sale at 8pm on Thursday after weeks of wrangling and accusations between Mayweather Promotions and Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum. Tickets for the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are on sale on Thursday . Pacquiao posted a picture of him looking in good shape 10 days before the fight . This thorny matter was settled at a meeting between Arum, Mayweather’s advisor Al Haymon and CBS television mogul Les Moonves who brokered the deal for the fight itself. The issues over the number of tickets, credentials and hotel rooms to be made available to each camp were all resolved. Since this required a separate contract with the MGM there was speculation that the fight might be in jeopardy. In reality May 2 in the Grand Garden Arena was always going to take place. Mayweather trains with his uncle Roger during a media workout in Las Vegas last week . Pacquiao is taken on the pads by trainer Freddie Roach in front of the watching media . Even Arum, angered as he was by delays he blamed on the Mayweather side for making the tickets release far later than for any big fight ever, had said: ‘There’s too much at stake for the plug to be pulled. Like half-billion dollars which it is now expected to generate, with Mayweather and Pacquiao set to bank at least $180million and $120m respectively, . Arum adds: ‘All the matters have been agreed and the contract is being drawn up.’ The vast majority of the 16,500 tickets were always destined to be parcelled up between the two promoters, the two cable networks sharing the pay-per-view broadcast and the MGM hotel group for their clients and high rollers. Only a token 1000 seats are going on public sale, at between $1,500 (£1,000) and $7,500 (£5,000) each. But none for the super-ringside tickets costing $10,000 (£6,600). There are reports that those seats will exchanged hands on ‘the alternative market’ for upwards of $200,000 (£133,000) As many as 50,000 tickets will be available to watch the fight at various MGM properties via closed-circuit television. Priced at $150 (£100), they will be on sale at 11pm on Thursday.

"An anonymous Good Samaritan has donated $360,000 to pay for a man's mortgage after he lost his wife and house in the mudslide that swept Washington last year. Tim Ward and his wife of 38 years, Brandy, were at home in Oso, Washington, on March 22, 2014, when tons of debris, soil and rock came crashing down from upland. Brandy was one of the 43 people crushed by the force of the natural disaster. Tim, who broke his pelvis, was buried under 25 feet of mud, but managed to call for help through a gap in the surface. Just a week later, as Tim started trying to rebuild his life, he was informed he did not have 'landslide insurance' - and therefore did not qualify for payment to settle his mortgage.

Her husband Tim (left) survived and has spent the past year trying to pay his mortgage, which a donor has now paid . Horrific: The mudslide on March 22, 2014, killed 43 people including Brandy Ward . For a year, Tim has been grappling with his financial predicament, while renting a small property nearby. He lost everything in the mudflow. Only one of their five dogs survived the mudslide, but lost a leg. The disaster killed their turkeys, chickens and four canines. The mortgage, however, consumed him. But last week, he received a call from Chase Bank, who said an anonymous donor had paid the lot. Before: This was their idyllic home in Oso where they reared turkeys and chickens before the mudslide . Love: The couple were married for 38 years. Tim said he heard Brandy call for him before she was killed . Overwhelmed: Ward said he couldn't believe it when Chase Bank told him the mortgage was all paid for . Speaking to NBC News, Tim said: 'There are still good Samaritans out there. This is life-changing.' He recalled the horrific day last year: 'She called my name and yelled, ""Tim!"" And from the moment that voice left her body, she had left the man she had been with for 38 years to be with the son of God she'll be with forever.' The donor told bank clerks they had read about Ward in a newspaper and felt compelled to reach out. 'I honestly have never seen this kind of an act of personal generosity where it's anonymous,' Phyllis Campbell, vice president at JP Morgan Chase, told NBC News.

"A talented Chinese lawyer who was banned from working in California because of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act has been finally granted a license, 89 years after his death. 'It was also a blow to countless others who, like Chang, aspired to become a lawyer only to have their dream deferred on account of their race, alienage, or nationality,' the unanimous court decision reads. 'It is past time to acknowledge that the discriminatory exclusion of Chang from the State Bar of California was a grievous wrong.' Struggle: Hong Yen Chang, from Guangdong Province, China, travelled to the U.S. in 1872 when he was 12 years old. He studied law at Colombia, graduating in 1886 with 'high markings from the examiners'. But he was banned from practising in California as he was 'a person of Mongolian nativity' Defiant: In later life, Hong served as a banker and a diplomat, and was awarded a doctorate of law by the Chinese government. But he was never granted a license to practise law in California . Hong Yen Chang, from Xiangshan, Guangdong Province, was chosen to travel to the U.S. in 1872 when he was 12 years old, as part of a Chinese Educational Mission. He studied law at Yale and Colombia, from where he graduated in 1886 with 'high markings from the examiners'. However, for the rest of his life he faced a struggle to practise law, as under 19th Century legislation 'a person of Mongolian nativity' would not be accepted to the bar. In 1888, after long deliberations, New York State passed An Act for the Relief of Hong Yen Chang, which waived the Chinese Exclusion Act in the state, allowing him to receive a license to practise law in New York. But the Californian authorities said that they did not recognise the New York ruling, leaving Hong unable to work there. On Monday, the California Supreme Court granted a . posthumous law license to Hong, known as America's first Chinese-born lawyer. This came in response to petitions made by Hong's descendants, as well as the Asian Pacific American Law Students . Association (APALSA) at the University of California. 'Even if we cannot undo history, we can acknowledge it and, . in so doing, accord a full measure of recognition to Chang's . pathbreaking efforts to become the first lawyer of Chinese . descent in the United States,' the court said in its unanimous . ruling. 'More than a century later, the legal and policy . underpinnings of our 1890 decision have been discredited.'

"Amazing pictures have emerged of blue fluorescent algae lighting up Australia's east coast. The images were taken in Jervis Bay, the south coast of NSW, as the neon glow illuminated one of Australia's popular beaches. Photographer Andy Hutchinson described the sight as a 'beautiful supernatural scene' caused by millions of plankton omitting light. A similar display was shown in Sydney's Manly Beach back in August 2014 where an oceanography expert told Daily Mail Australia there was no need to be concerned about the algae. 'The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes,' Iain Suthers, of University of New South Wales, said. Mr Suthers explained that the bizarre carnivorous cell, which preys on another type of algae called diatoms, gives off the luminous glow as a defence mechanism. Scroll down for video .

"Having fathered 40 children by 20 different women, Mike Holpin has enjoyed his fair share of intimacy. But seemingly unsatisfied with his gaggle of offspring, scorned former lovers and being engaged for the fourth time, the 56-year-old is showing no signs of settling down soon. For despite being set to marry, the alcoholic benefits claimant still has a live profile on the site where he met his bride-to-be. Despite being engaged for the fourth time and having already fathered 40 children by 20 different women, Mike Holpin still has an active online dating profile . Offering a half-grin to the camera with his signature pony-tail tucked away from view, Holpin tells prospective conquests: 'I love my kids,' in a brief biography on his Plenty of Fish account. Listed among his hobbies is watching TV and playing computer games - a luxury indulged by the taxpayer who footed the bill for his three 48in widescreen television sets, as revealed earlier this week. But while Holpin paints himself as a doting father, one of his many children has spoken out to confirm the feeling is not mutual. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, two of his sons have revealed they wish they'd never even come into contact with him. Fearful that any girl he meets during a night out may be his sister, care worker Mike Holpin Junior, 22, said dramatically: 'I wish I'd never met my dad. I'd rather be related to Hitler than to him.' Younger brother Luke, 21, said so bad was his father's womanising, his mother once tried to stab him with a butter knife after being duped out of money to buy new motorbikes. 'As soon as the money dried up he moved on. It devastated her. 'She caught him snogging another woman in the garden and tried to stab him with a butter knife.' 'I won't stop': Father of 40 Mike Holpin, left and right with his fiancée Diane, is said to have cost taxpayers £4.3million in benefits and other costs because of his huge family . Family: Holpin says that he loves sex and won't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care . The brothers also claimed their father spent the majority of his benefits payouts on alcohol and new bikes. Earlier this week it was revealed Holpin had cost the taxpayer an estimated £4million in benefits and care costs by fathering so many children. At least 16 have been taken off him and their mothers and placed into care. CARE COSTS: Mike Holpin says 16 of his children were taken into care. A placement in local authority care costs an average of £150,000 a year. If they each spent just a year in care, the bill would be £2.4million. CHILD BENEFIT: £1,000 per annum for the eldest child, plus £700 per year for each additional child, which would be claimed by the person looking after the child. Assuming half his children are now adults and half are still entitled to child benefit, the bill would be at least £500,000.

"Australian Open champion and top seed Novak Djokovic launched his BNP Paribas Open title defence in ruthless style on Saturday, crushing Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis 6-1 6-3 in the second round. Playing near-flawless tennis from the baseline, the Serb broke his opponent twice in each set to coast to victory in just under an hour on the showpiece stadium court at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Fourth seed Andy Murray erased memories of early losses at the venue with a 6-1 6-3 demolition of Canadian Vasek Pospisil and Japanese trailblazer Kei Nishikori recovered from an erratic start to beat American Ryan Harrison 6-4 6-4. World No 1 Novak Djokovic made light work of his first round match at the BNP Paribas Open . Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis was no match for the Australian Open champion at Indian Wells . Djokovic, seeking a fourth title at Indian Wells, breezed through the opening set in just 25 minutes before sealing the win when Baghdatis hit a backhand long on the second match point. 'It went very well for me, a very solid performance from the beginning,' the world No 1 said courtside after improving his record this season to 15-2. 'I served well and from the baseline I didn't give Marcos many chances to come back in the match. Great performance against a quality opponent, against somebody that was a former top-10 player and that knows how to play on a big stage. 'Of course, having won the title in Australia, it allows me to have and carry this confidence into every other event that is coming up in the season.' Djokovic takes time out from the tournament to have a kickabout in the sunshine . Andy Murray celebrates his first round victory over Vasek Pospisil by hitting a ball into the crowd . Murray broke Pospisil's serve three times in the opening set and twice in the second to ease to victory in 79 minutes on a sweltering afternoon. Ousted in the opening round in 2011 and 2012, the 27-year-old Scot hit 14 winners and won five of his nine break point chances to dominate the match. 'I've struggled a bit in the last few years here so I decided to try and play a very solid match and adjust to the conditions,' world number four Murray said. 'It was very hot and that made the ball pretty lively. 'Controlling the ball isn't that easy. I thought I played quite a smart match.' Kei Nishikori was made to sweat before finishing off local boy Ryan Harrison in straight sets . Nishikori, who became the first Asian male to reach a grand slam singles final at the U.S. Open last year, broke Harrison five times while losing his own serve on three occasions before sealing his win in just under an hour and a half. 'It was a bit up and down but I played well in the second set,' said the 25-year-old Japanese. 'I was playing almost a perfect game.' The fifth seed, who lost to Marin Cilic in last year's U.S. Open final before

"England's campaign at the European Under 21 Championship looks set to be dominated over whether Harry Kane is included - but Gareth Southgate may not need him. In front of over 30,000 at the Riverside Stadium, England came from behind to defeat Germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the Czech Republic this summer. Southgate is still expected to do everything he can to include the Tottenham striker, but the win over Germany shows that the Young Lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of Europe. Here Sportsmail looks at England's three stand-out stars from the win in Middlesbrough. James Ward-Prowse . The Southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at St Mary's and is set to be a key member of Southgate's side in the Czech Republic. The 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after ghosting into the penalty box to find space. But his attacking play extends to set-pieces. Germany's Julian Korb reaches out in vain as James Ward-Prowse fires home England's winning goal . The Under 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance . In Ward-Prowse, England have potentially their best dead-ball specialist since David Beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game. Ward-Prowse was captain for the Germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on. Carl Jenkinson . Named the official Man of the Match, Jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for Germany's opening goal after allowing the cross for Philipp Hofmann to fire home. But after a slow start to each half, the West Ham full-back, on loan from Arsenal, imposed himself down the right-hand side. Carl Jenkinson runs the ball out of defence for England as Germany substitute Nico Schulz looks on . Jenkinson put in a Man of the Match display having assisted two of England's three goals . It was the 23-year-old's cross for Jesse Lingard which helped draw the Three Lions level in the first half, while he also provided the pass for Ward-Prowse to tuck home the winning goal. With England's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area, Roy Hodgson could do worse than pick Jenkinson. Because if he doesn't, then Finland will as he can still play for the Scandinavian team. Nathan Redmond . Relished the battle with Germany full-back Christian Gunter, often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing. Redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach, with his passing in the final third managing to catch the German back four flat on a number of occasions. Nathan Redmond rifles home England's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner . Redmond celebrates after drawing England level late in the game following an impressive display on the right .
