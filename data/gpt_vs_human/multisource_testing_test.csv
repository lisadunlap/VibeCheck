What does the idea of effective nuclear charge tell us,"['The term ""effective"" is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevents higher orbital electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge by the repelling effect of inner-layer electrons.']","[""Effective nuclear charge (also known as effective atomic number) is a concept used in chemistry to describe the net positive charge experienced by an electron in an atom. The effective nuclear charge is a measure of the overall attraction between an electron and the nucleus of an atom, taking into account the shielding effect of other electrons in the atom.\\n\\nThe effective nuclear charge can be used to explain the chemical behavior of an element, as it determines the strength of the attraction between an electron and the nucleus. Elements with a high effective nuclear charge tend to have higher electronegativities and be more likely to form chemical bonds, while elements with a lower effective nuclear charge tend to have lower electronegativities and be less likely to form chemical bonds.\\n\\nEffective nuclear charge is also a key factor in determining the properties of an element's electron cloud, including the energy levels of its electrons and the shapes of its atomic and molecular orbitals. Understanding the effective nuclear charge can help chemists predict the behavior of atoms and molecules, which is important in many fields including medicine, materials science, and environmental science."", ""The idea of effective nuclear charge is a concept used in chemistry to describe the effective positive charge experienced by an electron in a molecule or an atom. It is a measure of the net positive charge that an electron experiences due to the presence of the nucleus and the other electrons in the atom or molecule.\\n\\nEffective nuclear charge is a useful concept because it allows us to understand and predict the behavior of electrons in an atom or molecule. For example, the effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron in an atom or molecule can influence the electron's energy level and its ability to participate in chemical reactions.\\n\\nEffective nuclear charge is typically calculated using a combination of quantum mechanical principles and empirical data. The value of the effective nuclear charge for a given electron can be affected by the presence of other electrons, the shielding effect of the inner electrons, and the size of the atom or molecule.\\n\\nIn general, the effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron increases as the number of protons in the nucleus increases, as the electron is attracted to the positive charge of the nucleus. The effective nuclear charge also increases as the number of other electrons in the atom or molecule decreases, because there are fewer electrons to shield the positive charge of the nucleus."", 'The effective nuclear charge (also known as the effective atomic number) is a concept used in chemistry to describe the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom. It takes into account the shielding effect of inner electrons, which reduces the net positive charge experienced by outer electrons.\\n\\nThe effective nuclear charge is important because it determines the strength of the attraction between the nucleus and the outer electrons, which in turn affects the energy levels of the electrons and the chemical properties of the atom. For example, atoms with a higher effective nuclear charge tend to have a higher ionization energy (the energy required to remove an electron from the atom), and they also tend to have a greater affinity for electrons (a measure of their ability to gain or share electrons in chemical reactions).\\n\\nThe effective nuclear charge can be calculated using the following formula:\\n\\nEffective nuclear charge = (Number of protons in the nucleus) - (Number of inner-shell electrons)\\n\\nThis formula takes into account the fact that inner-shell electrons shield outer-shell electrons from the full positive charge of the nucleus, reducing the net positive charge experienced by the outer-shell electrons.

how deep can be drill for deep underwater,['Deepwater drilling is the process of oil and gas exploration and production in depths of more than 500 feet.'],"['The depth at which drilling is possible underwater depends on a variety of factors, including the type of drilling equipment being used, the type of formation being drilled, and the ambient pressure at the depth at which drilling is occurring.\\n\\nIn general, drilling equipment used for deepwater drilling must be designed to withstand the high ambient pressure at depths of several thousand meters. For example, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which suffered a catastrophic explosion in 2010, was drilling at a depth of around 1,500 meters (5,000 feet). Other drilling operations have taken place at depths of several kilometers, using specialized drilling equipment and techniques.\\n\\nIt is also worth noting that drilling at great depths can be challenging due to the extreme conditions and the technical difficulties involved. Deepwater drilling operations require specialized equipment, highly trained personnel, and extensive planning and safety measures to ensure the safety of workers and the integrity of the drilling equipment.', 'There are several factors that determine how deep a drill can go underwater, including the type of drill being used, the materials being drilled through, and the environmental conditions.\\n\\nOne type of drill that is commonly used for deep underwater drilling is a submersible drilling rig. These rigs are designed to operate at depths of up to 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) and are used for a variety of purposes, including oil and gas exploration, construction, and scientific research.\\n\\nOther types of drills, such as diamond core drills, can also be used for deep underwater drilling, although they are generally not as effective as submersible drilling rigs.\\n\\nThe materials being drilled through can also impact the depth at which a drill can operate. For example, drilling through solid rock may require a more powerful drill or specialized drilling techniques, while drilling through softer materials like sand or mud may be easier.\\n\\nFinally, the environmental conditions can also affect the depth at which a drill can operate. Factors such as water pressure, temperature, and currents can all impact the ability of a drill to function effectively at deeper depths.\\n\\nOverall, the depth at which a drill can operate underwater is largely dependent on the specific equipment and techniques being used, as well as the materials and environmental conditions present.', 'The maximum depth at which a drill can operate underwater depends on several factors, including the type of drill being used, the strength and durability of the drill and its components, and the pressure and conditions at the drilling site.

how was color introduced in film?,['The first color cinematography was by means of additive color systems such as the one patented in England by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899 and tested in 1902.A simplified additive system was developed by George Albert Smith and successfully commercialized in 1909 as Kinemacolor .'],"['Color has been used in films for almost as long as the medium itself has existed. One of the earliest examples of color in film is the 1895 film ""The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station"" by the Lumière brothers, which used a color process known as Autochrome Lumière. This process involved placing a layer of microscopic potato starch grains, each dyed red, green, or blue, over a black and white film stock, which would filter the light passing through the film and create a color image.\\n\\nOver the years, various other color processes were developed, including hand-coloring, two-color systems, and three-color systems. However, it wasn\'t until the 1950s that color films became the norm, thanks to the development of more advanced color film stocks and processes, such as Eastmancolor and Technicolor. Today, most films are shot and exhibited in color, although some filmmakers still choose to shoot in black and white for artistic or thematic reasons.', 'Color film has been around since the late 1800s, but it wasn\'t until the 1930s that it became widely used in motion pictures. The first feature-length color film was ""The Gulf Between,"" which was produced by the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation and released in 1917. However, this film was not commercially successful and it wasn\'t until the 1930s that color film became more widely used.\\n\\nOne of the first successful color films was ""The Wizard of Oz,"" which was released in 1939. This film used the Technicolor process, which involved shooting the film on black and white film stock and then using a special camera to record color information on a separate strip of film. This process was used for many years, but it was eventually replaced by more advanced techniques such as Eastman Color and Technicolor\'s dye transfer process.\\n\\nIn the 1950s, Eastman Kodak introduced a new color film stock called Kodacolor, which made it easier and cheaper to produce color films. This helped to further popularize the use of color in motion pictures. Today, the vast majority of films are shot in color, and the use of black and white is mostly reserved for artistic or stylistic purposes.', 'Color has been a part of the film industry since its inception, but the technology for capturing and displaying color images has evolved significantly over time.\\n\\nOne of the earliest methods for adding color to film was the use of hand-colored black and white prints. This was a labor-intensive process in which individual frames of the film were colored by hand using dyes or paints. This method was used as early as the 1900s, but it was not widely adopted due to the time and cost involved.\\n\\nAnother early method for adding color to film was the use of color filters. This technique involved shooting the film using black and white film stock and then using color filters to alter the light that passed through the camera lens. This method was used in the 1920s and 1930s, but it was not very effective at reproducing realistic colors and was eventually abandoned.\\n\\nThe first successful method for adding color to film was the Technicolor process, which was developed in the 1920s. This process involved shooting the film using special Technicolor film stock and then using a complex process to produce color prints from the black and white negatives. Technicolor was used to produce many of the most iconic color films of the 20th century, including ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.""\\n\\nToday, most films are shot using digital cameras and are automatically captured in color.

Why do we have separate tax brackets ? Would n't it be easier if we had a flat percentage taken out across the board for individuals ? . Explain like I'm five.,"[""There is a concept of marginal utility -- the first dollar is more important than later dollars . If you are homeless , having a dumpy studio is a more beneficial than middle manager being able to upgrade from a 3BR house to a 5BR house . Having food to eat is more important than whether you eat chicken breast or splurge on the steak . And so on ... So the lower earnings dollars are more critical to the basic necessities of life and are thus taxed at a lower rate than dollars earned where they are going to be spent on qualitative enhancements rather than necessities . To keep a tax rate even among all income , then you 'd need to tax people making minimum wage way more then they pay today , when they are already living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to make ends meet -- all while taxing lower taxes from those making six , seven , eight figures or more . Does it sound fair for somebody making $ 15k pay more taxes while cutting the taxes of somebody making $ 1.5 million ? And by the way , tax rates are marginal , too ... this means that everybody pays the same rate on the same dollars earned . If you 're in the top tax bracket , which is 39.6 % you only pay that rate on the dollars you earn over $ 418,400 where that tax rate kicks in -- you DO NOT pay that rate on your entire income . So if you earned $ 50k and somebody else made $ 500k , you 'd both pay the same rate on the first $ 50k earned ."", ""There are two basic justifications for this . First , the idea is that in terms of the impact on someone 's lifestyle of losing a larger percentage of their income matters less as income increases . Second , and related , is that lower - income people are more likely to spend their money , and so taxing it at the same rate reduces economic demand ."", 'Tax brackets are simple way to create a progressive tax . The brackets are a simplification a alternative like a continuous mathematical function to calculate the tax for the income . The motivation of a progressive tax it that a flat tax is a higher budon for people with low income . Everyone need to spend money on the basic things needed to survive like food , housing etc . So a higher tax is is a higher budon for someone that make precisely enough to survive then for a person with twice the income and obvious less a budon for someone with ten time the income . A progressive tag is constructed so every one pays the same tax for the first $ 100 they earn regardless of their total income but the tax rate will be higher for the next $ 100 ( the amounts are just a example ) Som people might argue that a flat tax is more fare the a progressive tag . You could motivate the alternative and the amount the tax increases with income . But to say that we should use flat tax because it is a bit simpler to calculate it not a good way to motivate it . Argue instead for fairness or the ability for a person to pay tax not de difficulty of a simple calculation . To make tax simple you should have tax systems like it is often done in Europe . The tax form include most information already and for a significant part of the population the correct way for them to submit their taxes is to only sign the form .']","[""\\nTax brackets are a way to set different tax rates for different levels of income. The idea is to make the tax system more fair by making sure that people who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.\\n\\nHere's an example to help explain how tax brackets work:\\n\\nImagine that the tax rate is 10% for people who earn less than $50,000 per year, 20% for people who earn between $50,000 and $100,000 per year, and 30% for people who earn more than $100,000 per year.\\n\\nIf you earn $40,000 per year, you would be in the 10% tax bracket and would have to pay 10% of your income in taxes, which would be $4,000.\\n\\nIf you earn $60,000 per year, you would be in the 20% tax bracket and would have to pay 20% of your income in taxes, which would be $12,000.\\n\\nIf you earn $200,000 per year, you would be in the 30% tax bracket and would have to pay 30% of your income in taxes, which would be $60,000.\\n\\nThe reason we have tax brackets instead of a flat percentage for everyone is to make the tax system more progressive.

It is true that Native American cultures and histories have not always been well-represented or understood in mainstream education. There are several reasons for this. One reason is that the histories and cultures of Native American peoples have often been overshadowed by the narrative of European colonization and the creation of the United States. This narrative has often focused on the experiences and perspectives of European settlers and downplayed or excluded the perspectives and experiences of Native American peoples. Another reason is that the histories and cultures of Native American peoples have often not been well-documented or preserved. This is due in part to the fact that many Native American cultures were oral cultures, meaning that they passed down their histories and traditions through stories, songs, and other forms of oral tradition rather than through written records. This can make it more difficult to learn about Native American history compared to the histories of other groups that have more extensive written records. Finally, the histories and cultures of Native American peoples have often been impacted by trauma and violence, including forced removal from their lands, assimilation into mainstream culture, and the loss of many traditional ways of life. This has made it more challenging to preserve and pass on Native American histories and traditions. Overall, it is important to recognize and learn about the diverse histories and cultures of Native American peoples, and to work to ensure that these histories are accurately and respectfully represented in mainstream education.']",,reddit_eli5,14080
Why has n't China started phasing out symbolic writing and started standardizing phonetic ( pinyin 拼音 ) writing ? Would n't standardized pinyin as the primary written communication make it easier for Westerners to learn Chinese and for the Chinese to learn English ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Part of it is that while there is a unified Chinese * written * language , there are dozens ( maybe hundreds , I do n't know for sure ) of difference * spoken * Chinese languages ( i.e. dialects ) . Pinyin corresponds to Mandarin Chinese ( the official spoken language ) while there are many other dialects ( Cantonese , Shanghainese , Fujianese , etc . ) which will have the same written form as Mandarin , but are spoken completely differently . Having a unified character language makes things easier when communicating between different dialects ."", ""Yes but changing a few billion people 's written language for the sake of making it easier to learn a different language is n't something the Chinese government seems especially keen on doing ."", ""There 's quite a lot of writing in the old format -- several millenia of classic literature , history , and philosophy . As long as that writing system is still in common use , all of those books are relatively accessible to the population at large . If you change writing systems , suddenly you have a cultural divide between the present and the past . China does not want a culture divide between the present and the past . Its ability to function as a country is dependent on people perceiving themselves as part of the gigantic country of China . Part of that identity is continuity with the thousands of years of culture . The Chinese government implicitly takes legitimacy by association with the traditions that preceded it ( notwithstanding actual resemblance to those traditions ) . Breaking off from history may lead to a new cultural identity , and potentially one that is fragmented or locally - based rather than nationally unified . That is something the Chinese government wants to avoid .""]","['Pinyin is actually a standardized system for writing Chinese using the Roman alphabet, and it is widely used in China for teaching Chinese as a second language, transcribing proper nouns and place names, and as a tool for inputting Chinese characters on computers and phones. \nHowever, Pinyin is not used as the primary written form of Chinese. Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi or Kanji in Japanese) are the primary written form of Chinese and have a long history dating back over 3,000 years. They are still used today because they are an important part of Chinese culture and history, and they are also very efficient for written communication. \nOne of the main reasons that Pinyin is not used as the primary written form of Chinese is that it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words. Chinese characters, on the other hand, can convey the full meaning and pronunciation of a word in a single character. For example, the Chinese character for ""water"" is 水, which is pronounced ""shui"" in Mandarin. Pinyin cannot represent the meaning of the character, only the pronunciation. \nAdditionally, replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin as the primary written form of Chinese would be a massive undertaking that would involve changing the way that Chinese is taught in schools, updating dictionaries and other reference materials, and potentially requiring people to learn a new writing system. It would also be difficult to determine a standard way to represent the many different regional accents and dialects of Chinese using the Roman alphabet. \nIn summary, while Pinyin is a useful tool for learning Chinese and transcribing proper nouns, it is not used as the primary written form of Chinese because it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words, and replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin would be a major undertaking.']",,reddit_eli5,1157

Literally , his arm was almost a Z. He had limited usage of his fingers because of the way the tendons were situated afterwards and had a pretty limited range of motion for his wrist . He became predominantly left handed , as would be expected . I will have to try and dig up a picture of it ( if I still have the pic , that is ) . TL;DR , just go to the hospital . It can seriously fuck you up otherwise ."", ""Think of your bone as a bridge . When you break the bone , it 's like breaking the bridge in the middle .

If you aim the two ends of the bridge right at each other , or even put them back together with a cast , when the bridge adds more concrete , it wo n't have to add a lot and can heal quickly ( primary bone healing ) . If you never stop moving the two ends of the bridge , the bridge will never come back together , as shown in the video here with the humerus fracture .

It 's like connecting the bridge edges together with steel beams so that the bridge does not move at all , allowing the concrete to fill in directly with no movement . After the concrete fills in , you can either keep the steel plates or remove then , and you can remove the cast because it 's no longer needed . Bone heals in 4 - 6 weeks when immobilized .""]","[""If you break a bone and don't go to the hospital, it means that the bone is not being treated by a doctor. This can be a problem because the bone may not heal correctly. When a bone is broken, the body tries to fix it by creating new cells to mend the break. These new cells eventually turn into new bone, which helps the broken bone heal. However, if the bone is not properly aligned while it is healing, it may heal in the wrong position. This can cause the bone to be weaker and more prone to breaking again in the future. It can also cause the joint to not work properly, which can make it difficult to use your hand or wrist. If you think you have broken a bone, it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. The doctor will be able to tell you if you have a broken bone and how to best treat it so that it can heal properly.""]",344.0,reddit_eli5,1951
How does comedy writing work ? Comedians who write bits and jokes and what not . What is the process which goes into the development of a bit ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['It is much easier to find something funny about a topic than to simply come up with a funny thing on its own . Have you noticed how jokes effortlessly come to you in conversation ? It \'s because ideas are being thrown around , and your brain is automatically making connections with other stuff you know in the background . When trying to come up with jokes , the trick is to start from concepts , and only then craft comedy out of it . & nbsp ; Let \'s go with * * Dogs * * . I \'ll list some arbitrary facts about them . 1 . They are loyal to their owners regardless of the situation 2 . They eat disgusting things if given the opportunity 3 . They have a warped sense of time 4 . They ca n\'t eat chocolate 5 . Small ones are often more aggresive than larger ones 6 . They smell each others \' butts as a greeting 7 . They get happy and jittery very easily 8 . They hate the mailman 9 . They have a pack mentality & nbsp ; As you write concepts down , some straightforward bits might start forming on their own . 4 and 2 connect for a very obvious joke - the fact that dogs eat disgusting stuff all the time , but will get very sick if they eat a piece of chocolate . > Dogs make no sense . They will eat their own poop and vomit , spoiled food and all sorts of nasty shit and be fine - but give them a bit of chocolate ? They fucking die . > Like , "" Oh man , this dead pigeon tastes delicious ! But do n\'t give me that chocolate shit , that \'s disgusting "" & nbsp ; It \'s also a good idea to list inherently funny things related to a topic , and potential double entendres and wordplays to use : 1 . Dogs that make for funny mental images : * Chihuahuas , Pugs , Poodles * 2 . ~~Funny~~ Staple Dog Names : * Fido , Rex * ( Thanks /u / rewboss ! ) 3 . Potential double entendre : * Bitch * 4 . Potential wordplay : * Hot Dog * & nbsp ; For the next bit , I \'ll use number 6 with a funny dog name and a reference to the previous joke : > Is n\'t it weird how dogs sniff each other \'s butts as a way to greet each other ? "" What up Fido ? Smelling good today ! Had some dead pigeon last night , huh ? "" & nbsp ; Of course , if you want a lot of jokes , you will need a much longer list . You can search for more facts online , use or make up related stories , and keep adding more wordplay material . Referencing a previous joke is always a good idea , too . As you expand your list , new bits will form at an astonoshing rate . & nbsp ; Last but not least , remember that jokes will always seem stale on paper - the delivery is very important for them to work . In order to get good with that , you may want to watch some stand - up comedians do their magic . & nbsp ; * EDIT : Formatting * * EDIT 2 : This method is a simplification of something I learned from a [ Jerry Corley video ] ( URL_0 ) *', 'I define comedy as an intersection between reality and absurdity . You \'re essentially asking about what comedy is . A lot of old definitions hark back to such ideas ( young versus old , for instance ) . Comedians , specifically some of the best , talk about absurdities in reality , or inject absurdity into reality by taking turns you would n\'t expect . A lot of times it \'s about breaking the cooperative principle of language - which is to say , when people communicate , they \'re cooperating . Otherwise nothing they say would make sense . If you ask for the time and I say my phone is dead , years ago that would have made no sense . But now it does , and you have to cooperate intrinsically to understand that I \'m helping you with more information . Comedians often break these rules on purpose to mislead people from reality into absurdity . They set up a premise , and then "" tweak it "" .

Try to be funny in your stream of thought and fill out a page . This overall makes you a funnier person , when you look back and reread it you \'ll see 6 or 7 \' concepts \' that you can now reword more succinctly into a joke . It also sharpens your mind so that you can be funny more consistently and for longer , and that will reflect in your spoken words in conversation . As far as writing one - liner jokes go , see an object that you find peculiar , then just think about it , think about what relates to it , think of what is obscure about it and then put it one sentence . After you write 500 of those , spanning many different topics , pick out the 50 best ones or pair the jokes that share a common topic and reword them ( if possible ) so they fit more like a puzzle piece . This is how I do it and I think this is how Mitch Hedberg did it . When he says 3 one - liners in a row that are all on the same topic , it \'s likely that he wrote them at 3 different times , maybe years apart . This is an essential part of being a comedian , holding as many jokes in your working memory that you can and then recalling them upon the realization that they mesh well with other jokes/ topics , or saying them aloud in conversation ( it seemed so RANDOM of you to say that , but it \'s a joke you \'ve been subconsciously holding on to ) for that sweet gratifying laughter . The thing that compels you to keep making more jokes .']","[""Comedy writing is the process of creating jokes and comedic material. A comedian will often start by coming up with an idea or concept for a joke, and then they will brainstorm different ways to turn that idea into a funny joke or story. They might start by writing down their ideas in a notebook, or they might talk through their ideas with a friend or fellow comedian to get feedback and help them develop their ideas further. Once they have a strong idea, the comedian will then work on crafting the joke or bit, experimenting with different word choices and delivery methods to make the joke as funny as possible. This process can take a lot of trial and error, as the comedian will often need to try out different versions of the joke in front of an audience to see what works and what doesn't.""]",,reddit_eli5,7700

Nutrients are substances found in food that are necessary for our bodies to function properly. They include things like protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, and minerals. \nJunk food is often high in calories, but low in nutrients. While it may provide some energy, it does not provide the nutrients that our bodies need to stay healthy. People who eat a lot of junk food may be at risk for developing nutrient deficiencies, which can lead to a variety of health problems. These can include problems with growth and development, weak bones, and problems with the immune system. \nIt's important to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins.

How spiral arms form in galaxies Should n't it be like stirring hot chocolate powder in a cup ? Explain like I'm five.,"['The speed of rotation of a galaxy is a bit weird to say the least .

From the middle of the radius to the centre of the galaxy , speed again decreases . So what you have here is bits of matter ( gas , dust , planetary systems etc ) and stars which are held loosely together due to gravity . The matter bunched up into arms , due to the arrangement of the galactic magnetic fields . Due to the uneven rotation speed , the middle of these structures gets "" smeared "" all over the place , as the faster middle overtakes the slow centre and the edge . ps : Its a good thing we are living in a spiral galaxy , the other kinds of galaxies have virtually no heavy elements , hence , chances of intelligent life or even , higher forms of life is almost zero .', ""Here 's an interesting and relevant simulation that may help to visualise the process .

The main thing about 4 G is that it is ( or is going to be ) much faster than 3G. Phones require specific hardware ( antennas or chips ) to use 4G. As mentioned by kevtice15 , an international technology union ( the [ ITU - R ] ( URL_1 ) ) set out some goals for 4G. IIRC , T - Mobile started calling their 3 G network "" 4 G "" after an upgrade made it much faster . Other carriers joined in and eventually the ITU - R said , "" That 3 G is pretty advanced . I guess you guys can call it 4G. "" The ITU - R had two big goals that were n\'t being met : speed requirements , and a network that routes calls using Internet - based technology . Depending on your carrier , 4 G can mean different technologies and different levels of battery drainage ( although battery drainage also depends on a number of other factors ) . If you \'re with Verizon , AT & T , or Sprint , you \'re probably on LTE . LTE stands for "" Long Term Evolution "" and is the most widely used 4 G technology . It \'s really fast , and an upcoming update will make it much faster . T - Mobile is eventually going to launch 4 G as well . If you \'re with Sprint , you could also be on WiMax ; WiMax is basically Wi - Fi on steroids . It \'s very fast , but it \'s not very popular outside of the USA . If you \'re on T - Mobile or AT & T , you could also be on HSPA+ , which stands for "" High Speed Packet Access "" . It \'s basically 3 G but with a better internet connection . This is the network T - Mobile started calling "" 4 G "" . I suspect it will eventually be demoted to 3.75G. HSPA+ can download 84 [ Mbps ] ( URL_0 ) at its very maximum . Wi - Fi can go up to 150 Mbps , depending on the kind of Wi - Fi you \'re using . LTE and WiMax are capable of going faster than that , up to about 1 Gbps .

It is faster than 3G, which is the previous generation of cellular technology. When you are using 4G, you can expect faster internet speeds, which means that websites will load more quickly and you will be able to download and stream video and other content more smoothly.\n\nOne reason that 4G may be faster than WiFi is because it uses a different type of connection. WiFi is a wireless internet connection that relies on a router or other device to connect to the internet, while 4G is a cellular connection that uses a network of towers and antennas to connect to the internet. This means that 4G can be faster in some cases, especially if you are in an area with a strong 4G signal.\n\nIt's also possible that you are experiencing faster speeds with 4G because the network is less congested. When a lot of people are using the same WiFi network, it can slow down the connection for everyone. With 4G, you are connected to a specific tower and antenna, so there is less competition for bandwidth.\n\nOverall, 4G is a faster and more reliable way to connect to the internet, especially if you are in an area with a strong 4G signal. It is particularly useful for people who use their phones or other devices to do a lot of online activities, such as streaming video, downloading music, or playing online games.""]",,reddit_eli5,14958

There are many different types of antioxidants, and they can be found in a variety of foods and supplements. Some of the best sources of antioxidants include fruits and vegetables, especially those that are brightly colored like berries, oranges, and leafy greens. Other good sources include nuts, seeds, and whole grains. It\'s important to get enough antioxidants because they can help keep our bodies healthy and strong.

"Explain the rules of Cricket to me please ! What are the core rules of gameplay ? What is the difference between Test Matches and the other , shorter matches ? Explain like I'm five.","[""there are 11 players on each side , played on a big oval pitch ( a field with grass on ) . In the middle of the oval is a pale strip , where the bowler throws a cricket ball at a team of batsmen from the other side . He 's trying to smash the three wooden poles called wickets , with the ball , but sometimes the bowler tries to make the batsmen hit it in the air so that the bowlers teammates can catch the ball . If they catch the ball while it 's in the air , before it 's hit the ground , the batsman is out . The batsman tries to score runs . He hits the ball in different ways so that he and his teammate at the other end of the strip can run back and forward between the wickets and score runs . If he hits it off the pitch without it hitting the ground , he does n't have to run because he gets 6 runs automatically , and no more . If he hits it off the pitch but it DOES hit the floor , he gets 4 runs automatically , but no more . The bowler , and the fielders try to catch the ball and throw it back while the batsmen are out of their ' crease ' , which is a little safe zone they stand in next to the wicket . It 's a line drawn in white . If the batsmen gets put out by the other team , then one of the other 11 players takes up his place . In theory , they should go through all 11 players , and that brings an end to the ' innings ' . Innings can end early because the batting side can say ' we 've had enough ' , or because of bad weather . The bowler is allowed to bowl 6 times . That 's called an ' over ' . Wide balls , and no - deliveries do n't count . In some games , the number of ' overs ' is limited to a set number to shorten the game and make it more exciting . There are a few different kinds of bowling styles . Some people like to throw it really fast to hit the wickets . Some people like to spin the ball and make it go in different directions to get around the batsman or make him hit it badly . The bowler will do whatever he can to try and trick the batsman . There are a few ways the batsman can go out . -Hit the wickets with the ball -The fielders catch a hit ball before it touches the floor -Leg before wickets . The ball is definitely going to hit the wickets , but it hits the batsman 's leg first . -When the batters are scoring runs , and are out of their ' creases ' ( batters safe zone ) the fielders hit the wickets with the ball -The batsman hits his own wickets by accident -The batsman hits the ball twice ( rarely happens ) -Deliberately touches the ball -After a batsman gets put out , if the next one does n't arrive by 3 minutes , he 's out too . After everyone has batted , the teams swap , and whoever has scored the most runs , wins the game ! ! ! Hope this is a good basic guide . edit : to include pitch explanation"", 'One team bats while the other team bowls and fields . The team which is bowling tries to get all of the batsmen "" out "" in one of several ways : * Caught ( the batsman hits the ball with his bat or hand , and one of the fielders catches it before it touches the ground ) * Bowled ( the bowler manages to knock the bails from the stumps - the stumps are three sticks in the ground and the bails are two smaller sticks which balance on top of them . ) * LBW ( The ball hits the batsman on the leg , and the umpire decides that it * would * have knocked the bails from the stumps if he had n\'t got in the way ) * Hit Wicket ( The batsman goes full retard and knocks the bails off himself ) * Stumped / Run Out ( The batsman leaves his crease after facing a delivery and the fielding team manages to knock the bails off with the ball before he can get back behind it . The crease is a line 1 yard in front of the stumps . ) * Handled ball ( The batsman deliberately plays the ball with his hand , usually to stop it rolling on to the stumps ) . The batsman try to score as many \' runs \' as they can before they get out . A run is scored by the two batsmen ( there are always two on the pitch - one at each end ) running down the pitch and swapping ends before the fielding team can run either of them out . You can score as many runs as you want at a time - if you can run from one end to the other 150 times without the fielding team managing to knock the bails off , then you would score 150 runs ( although this would never happen ) . You can also score boundaries . If you hit the ball over a rope which marks the edge of the field , you score either 6 runs ( for clearing it without bouncing ) or 4 runs . The game is divided into \' overs \' . An over is a period of 6 balls bowled by the same bowler from the same end of the pitch . He bowls at whichever batsman happens to be standing at that end of the pitch at the time ( which can change from ball to ball if they score an odd number of runs from a shot ) . At the end of an over , another bowler takes over and bowls an over from the opposite end of the pitch . The difference between the forms of the game is : * Test Cricket - the classic form of the game . Each side has two batting innings , and whoever scores the most runs after all of the opponents have been given \' out \' in both innings wins . If 5 days passes without anybody having won ( remember - to win you have to bowl the opposing team out twice and score more runs than they did in total ) then the game is a draw . * Limited overs ( One Day ) cricket . This is where a result is forced by having each team play one innings of a set number of overs , and whoever has the most runs after both teams have batted wins . Simple as that . The two forms of limited over international cricket are ODIs , which are 50 overs per side , and T20 , which is 20 overs per side . In test cricket , the batsmen are much more cautious , because it \'s more important not to get out than it is to score quickly . In limited overs games , you simply have to score quickly to win , so it \'s much more acceptable to take risks and play shots which could get you out . The opposite is true for bowlers - in test matches , it is far more important for them to take wickets than anything else , so they can take risks with where the fielders stand and the types of delivery they bowl to make it more likely that if a batsmen makes a mistake you will get him out , but if he does n\'t there will be lots of gaps for him to hit the ball to and score runs .

The goal is to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of three sticks (called wickets) on opposite ends of a rectangular field. One team, the batting team, tries to score as many runs as possible by hitting the ball and running back and forth between the wickets. The other team, the fielding team, tries to get the batting team's players out and stop them from scoring runs. There are two main types of cricket matches: Test matches and shorter matches. Test matches are longer and played over a period of five days. Shorter matches, like One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) matches, are played in a single day or over a few days. In a Test match, each team gets two chances to bat, called innings. The team that scores the most runs in their two innings wins the match. In shorter matches, each team only gets one innings to score as many runs as possible. The team that scores the most runs wins the match. There are several ways that a player can be out in cricket. Some common ways are: Caught: If the fielding team catches the ball after the batsman hits it, the batsman is out. Bowled: If the ball hits the wicket while the batsman is trying to hit it, the batsman is out. Leg Before Wicket (LBW): If the ball hits the batsman's leg and would have hit the wicket if the leg wasn't there, the batsman is out. Run out: If the fielding team hits the wicket with the ball while the batsman is running between the wickets, the batsman is out. There are many more rules and details in cricket, but those are the basic ideas. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.""]",51.0,reddit_eli5,1658

Atoms Is there a certain amount of atoms ? Or are there somehow forming more atoms ?

What exactly happens during electrocution ? I know that electrocution is bad and everything but i never really understood why Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Good question ! First lets dive into what exactly electrical current is . For the purposes of this explanation , it 's the flow of any charged atomic particle , such as electrons , or ions in solution . Ions include things like Sodium , potassium , calcium and chloride . The cells in your body that are capable of ' firing ' such as neurons , and muscles , pay a lot of attention to these ions . As you may know , cells are mostly water , and have a membrane surrounding them , made up of fatty acids . Water with ions conducts electric current really well , fatty acids do not . You can think of your cells , as kind of being like a battery , in that they have high levels of potassium ( + ) and chloride ( - ) on the inside of the cell . They actively exclude Sodium ( + ) , and selectively allow calcium(++ ) inside . Cells like neurons , regulate the ratio of ions inside / outside , and they try to maintain electroneutrality . Phrased differently , the number of positive charges inside the cell , should equal the number of negative charges inside the cell . If you get electrocuted , suddenly there is a huge amount of negative charge ' outside ' the cells , going into the cells and that really messes up the whole system through some very complicated elecrophysics beyond this discussion . The other major source of more understandable and relatable death and horror , is through resistance . When electricity is flowing through an electrical wire , there is some measure of resistance in that wire . It is usually very low , but there is some mild resistance that becomes significant . If you 've ever touched an insulated electrical wire , or put your hand on an electrical transformer , you 'll notice that it is significantly warm . As electrical current encounters resistance , it generates heat ; just like moving a physical object generates friction ( heat ) , electrical movement generates electrical friction , ergo- heat . The amount of heat is a matter of how much resistance you have , and how much electricity you are trying to move . As an electrical conductor , you are n't that great , and you have a fair amount of resistance . If you have a lot of electricity you 're trying to move ... like say a downed power line , you are going to generate a very large amount of heat , extremely quickly ; and it will literally cook you . If you 're trying to move a much more reasonable amount of electricity , such as licking a nine volt battery , the heat is n't the aspect you notice . You notice your taste bud / pain neurons getting annoyed and telling you to stop . Does that help ?"", 'Your neurons use electricity to communicate . If you get shocked , your neurons might treat it as if a signal needed to be sent . So it triggers randomly . Your muscles might tense up in opposite directions , and injure it self . All the neurons firing in your brain is basically a seizure , so if your brain gets shocked all the neurons might fire . Also electricity that is strong enough might burn the things it passes through . This means it might burn the inside of your body .', 'Electrocution is death caused by electrical current flowing through the body . Electrical current is the movement of charge . So , we need to understand how the movement of charge through the body can kill a human . First , the human body has electrical resistance to the flow of current moving through it . When current flows through a resistor , heat is generated ( this is how heat is generated in an electric stove , or a hairdryer ) . A large enough current flowing through the body will cause substantial burns to the tissue through which the current flows . This in and of itself can kill a person , either directly , when large thermal damage is done to a major organ , like the heart or the brain , or indirectly , when the electrocuted person suffers thermal damage over a large enough portion of their body , resulting in infection and/or an electrolyte imbalance . Second , both muscles and nerves maintain a electrochemical gradient across their cell membranes . This electrochemical gradient is required for nerves to "" fire "" ( i.e. carry information along a nerve ) and for muscles to contract . Death can occur when current flows through / near the heart muscle , disrupting the electrochemical gradient required for normal heart function . The current then causes a heart attack(cessation of the heartbeat , or an irregular heart beat that impairs the ability of the heart to normally pump blood ) . Death can also occur if a large electrical current flows through the brain , causing massive disruption of the normal functioning of the brain , and seizures . A normally functioning brain is required to signal the diaphragm to contract , the mechanism for breathing . A large electrical current though the brain can cause a cessation of breathing , resulting in death by hypoxemia ( insufficient oxygen content in arterial blood ) .']","[""Electrocution is when a person is killed or severely injured by an electric shock. When a person is electrocuted, electricity flows through their body, causing damage to their tissues and organs. This can happen if a person touches a live wire or electrical outlet, or if they come into contact with electricity in some other way.Electricity is a type of energy that can move through materials that allow it to flow easily, like metal. When electricity flows through a person's body, it can cause the muscles to contract, which can make it difficult for the person to move or breathe. It can also cause the heart to stop beating, which can be deadly.Overall, electrocution is dangerous because it can cause serious injury or death by disrupting the normal functioning of the body's tissues and organs. It's important to be careful around electricity and to follow safety guidelines to avoid accidents.""]",,reddit_eli5,6933

Here are some important things to consider when looking for a place to live:\n\nRenting vs. buying: Renting a place means you are paying someone else to live in their property, while buying a place means you own it and can make changes to it as you see fit. Renting can be a good option if you are not ready to commit to buying a home or if you are not sure where you want to live long-term. Buying a home can be a good option if you have the financial means and are planning to stay in one place for a while.\n\nMortgages: If you decide to buy a home, you will likely need to get a mortgage, which is a loan from a bank or other financial institution that you use to pay for the home. To get a mortgage, you will need to provide information about your income, debts, and credit history, and you will need to make a down payment (a portion of the total cost of the home that you pay upfront).\n\nLeases: If you decide to rent a place, you will sign a lease, which is a legal agreement between you and the property owner or landlord. The lease will outline the terms of your tenancy, including the length of the rental period, the amount of rent you will pay, and any rules or restrictions that apply.\n\nApartments, townhouses, condos, and houses: There are many different types of properties you can rent or buy, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Apartments are typically smaller, multi-unit buildings with shared common areas. Townhouses are attached homes that share walls with neighboring units. Condos are similar to apartments, but you own your unit rather than renting it. Houses are standalone properties that you own.\n\nOther factors to consider: When looking for a place to live, you may also want to consider the location, the size of the property, the cost of living in the area, and any amenities or features that are important to you, such as a pool or a garage. You may also want to think about the commute to your job or school and whether you need to be near public transportation or other conveniences.']",,reddit_eli5,14894

Explain like I'm five.","[""In 70 A.D. the Roman empire destroyed Jerusalem which scattered the Jews that lived there and they eventually came to have small populations in most countries in Europe and Russia . The Jews lived without a country for nearly 2000 years . After WWII , they decided that they wanted to have a country again , so a bunch of Jews went back to live in Israel . The problem was that in the last 2000 years another group of people had come to live there . They called themselves the Palestinians . When the Jews asked for their land back , the Palestinians told them that it was no longer their land . In 1947 , Israel took back the land by force and forced the Palestinians out . in 1967 another war broke out ( it lasted six days ) and the Israelis gained even more land .

At its core, the conflict is about competing claims to land and sovereignty in the region known as Palestine, which includes the modern state of Israel and the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The conflict has its roots in the late 1800s, when Jewish immigrants began moving to Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire. These immigrants, known as Zionists, believed that Palestine was the ancient homeland of the Jewish people and that they had a right to live there. However, the region was already home to a large Arab population, which opposed the influx of Jewish immigrants and the establishment of a Jewish state. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, the League of Nations granted a mandate to Britain to administer Palestine. The British government encouraged Jewish immigration to Palestine, but also promised to protect the rights of the Arab population. In 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem being designated as an international city. The Jewish community accepted the plan, but the Arab states rejected it and launched a war against the newly established state of Israel. Since then, the conflict has continued, with numerous wars, negotiations, and peace agreements attempted to resolve the dispute. The main issues at stake are control of Jerusalem, the status of Palestinian refugees, the building of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, and the right of Palestinian self-determination. The conflict has also been fueled by religious and cultural differences, as well as political and economic interests. It has caused significant suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians, and has had a major impact on the region and the world.']",426.0,reddit_eli5,2033

This process is called bremsstrahlung, which means ""braking radiation"" in German. The X-rays produced by the generator are then directed towards the part of the body being examined, and they pass through the body and are captured on film or a digital detector on the other side. \nX-rays are used in many medical and industrial applications because they can pass through most materials and produce images of the inside of objects. They are particularly useful for examining bones, as they are absorbed by soft tissue but not by bone. This allows doctors to see the inside of the body and identify any problems or injuries.']",,reddit_eli5,554

If your solar panels weigh 30 kg , they 've negated their benefit , as they 're generating the same power that the car is spending to move them .

How does hydrogen turn into people ? I know you 've heard the quote -- I saw fourteen of you use it today . But how ? What 's the chain of events that begins with hydrogen and ends with people ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Stars are bright and hot because in their cores they have nuclear fusion going on . Nuclear Fusion is when small elements are crunched together ( fused ) to form larger elements . Depending on the star , different atoms will be combined to create different elements . Some stars convert hydrogen into helium . Other stars convert helium into relatively light elements ( like oxygen and carbon ) , and still other stars ( usually very large stars that are in the process of dying ) create heavier elements like gold and uranium . Some stars will explode when they die , spilling a chunk of their constructed elements out into the universe . These elements might form into other stars ( creating more heavy elements ) or they might form into planets . Now , what about your body ? Your body is made up of cells , which are made up of molecules , which are made up of elements . Since you * are n't * made up of entirely hydrogen , every element in your body must have at some point been formed by a star . So hydrogen turns into people , but in a kind of roundabout way . First hydrogen has to turn into helium ( in a star ) , then the helium has to turn into even heavier elements ( also in a star ) , then the heavier elements need to turn into a planet ( after the star explodes ) , then that planet has to produce life ( through abiogenesis(we're actually not quite sure how this specifically happened on earth ) ) , and then that life has to turn into people ( through evolution ) ."", 'It \'s a pretty terrible quote , frankly . But there are two important things you need to know about to understand this : baryogenesis and nucleosynthesis . Settle down , I \'m gon na explain them . You \'ve heard of protons , yeah ? Protons are one of the three particles that atoms are made of . Protons are particles called * baryons * ; a protons is one type of baryon . There \'s another type of baryon that \'s also important : It \'s called a neutron . There are about a * zillion * other types of baryons that * are n\'t * important to us right now , but take all of these things collectively and we call them baryons . Baryons are not elementary things . That is , they \'re things which are made of other things . What are they made of ? A variety of particles that are called * quarks . * The question , then , is how did quarks * initially * get together to make baryons ? Or in other words , how did the first baryons come to exist ? The answer is the Big Bang . The Big Bang was the earliest period in the history of the universe , lasting from * zero * — what we call the time of the very first event that ever happened — to about 400,000 years later . Early on in the Big Bang , the universe was very hot and dense , so hot and dense that no matter could exist . Later , as the universe cooled , the first quarks appeared . But it turns out quarks , by themselves , are not stable , for deep and complicated reasons we wo n\'t go into here . Below a certain energy density , quarks are only stable when they link up in pairs and in threes . So as the universe cooled , those first primordial quarks did just that : They hooked up in pairs and in threes . The pairs we call mesons and we do n\'t care about them right now ; the three - particle collections of quarks we call * baryons * , and the proton is the lightest of all the baryons . But when the quarks first congealed into baryons , the result was both baryons and * antibaryons * . You know , like antimatter ? When a baryon of one type encounters an antibaryon of another type , the two particles annihilate each other , meaning they cancel each other out and release photons . When a * heavy * baryon and a heavy antibaryon get together , they release * very energetic * photons . Very energetic photons do n\'t want to stay photons any more ; they want to decay into lighter particles . We call these lighter particles * leptons * . The electron , which you \'ve doubtless heard of , is a lepton . So let \'s review what we \'ve got so far : First the universe was very hot . As it cooled , quarks appeared . As it cooled further , quarks hooked up in pairs and triplets to form mesons and baryons and their antiparticles . But the mesons and baryons and their antiparticles all got together and mutually annihilated , releasing energetic photons which decayed into electrons . That \'s how both protons and electrons first came into existence . Of course , that raises the question : If all the baryons got together with all the antibaryons and annihilated to make photons and leptons … how come there are still baryons in the universe ? I mean , we \'re * surrounded * by atoms made of protons and neutrons , and those are baryons , so how \'d they get here ? The answer is called * baryon asymmetry * . See , way back when the free quarks first condensed into baryons and antibaryons , for every ten billion antibaryons that formed , ten billion * and one * baryons formed . So when all the annihilation happened , we had one baryon in ten billion left over with no partner to annihilate with . So those particles stayed around , and that \'s the origin of all the baryonic matter in the universe today . Why did that baryon asymmetry exist ? Nobody knows for sure . We already know about processes in nature that slightly favor baryons over antibaryons , so we know it \'s possible for that asymmetry to exist . But its precise nature is gon na remain a mystery for a while yet . Anyway , there we are , a bit after the start of the Big Bang . Quarks appeared , hooked up to make baryons , baryons annihilated releasing leptons and a * very slight * trace of leftover baryons . Meaning we had a universe that was filled with a hot gas of mostly protons and electrons and basically nothing else . As this gas cooled , the protons — which have positive electric charge — and the electrons — negative electric charge — got together . You know what you get when you put a proton and an electron together , do n\'t you ? You get * hydrogen . * That \'s how hydrogen came to exist : The universe cooled , and all those free protons and electrons hooked up . So the universe went from being filled with a hot electron - proton plasma to a merely warm ( a few thousand degrees ) neutral hydrogen gas . Well , this hydrogen gas was n\'t perfectly evenly distributed . It was denser in some places than in others . In places where it was denser , gravity started to pull the gas together to make it denser still . Once enough hydrogen gas gets together , a process called * nuclear fusion * can happen . Basically , if you squish two hydrogen nuclei — protons , in other words — together , they \'ll * stick * and make a helium nucleus . And if you stick two heliums together you get a beryllium , which is unstable and decays into a lithium … and so on . The trick is , none of these reactions can happen unless the hydrogen gas is really hot and really dense , which means you need a lot of it in one place . It took a few million years for this to happen , but once it did , you got * stars . * Stars are where * nucleosynthesis * happens . You start with hydrogen and smoosh the nuclei together to make bigger nuclei , then smoosh those nuclei together to make still bigger nuclei … then the star explodes . Because those first stars that existed did n\'t live very long . They were really inefficient , so once they got to a point where they could n\'t support themselves by fusing hydrogen into helium , they popped like balloons and scattered their contents through space . Which meant now you had this big clouds of hydrogen * and helium * , which again started to collapse under their own weight and turned into the next generation of stars . These fused the heavier stuff inside them into still heavier stuff , then popped and scattered their fusion products through space , products like carbon and nitrogen and oxygen . These subsequent clouds collapsed again and formed stars … but that \'s not all . Those clouds also congealed to form things smaller than stars , made up of heavier elements that had n\'t been present in the universe before , elements like iron and nickel and silicon , plus in at least one case a lot of leftover hydrogen that bonded with oxygen . We call these smaller things * planets * and the leftover - hydrogen - plus - oxygen * water * . And then one of those planets ended up having people on it . So yes , in a sense hydrogen turned into people , first through the process of baryogenesis — where hydrogen appeared for the first time in the universe — and then through nucleosynthesis — where hydrogen got smooshed together to make more interesting things inside the cores of about three generations of stars and about ten billion years . But just saying that "" hydrogen turns into people "" somehow manages to throw away all the * interesting * stuff and leave just one mundane , totally uninteresting fact that \'s sort - of true but not really .', ""Our sun is in it 's second life cycle , and is in the region of 4.5 billion years old . Before this , a much bigger star , made of 99.9 % hydrogen a little helium and a pinch of lithium ( all residue from the big bang , ) was floating around in space somewhere . This star had enough gravity in its core to fuse hydrogen in to larger heavier atoms like oxygen , carbon , iron and everything else that makes up the earth . Being so big , this star went into supernova . Basically it exploded , spewing all these heavy atoms out into nowhere . Thicker parts of this cloud of atoms started to gravitate towards each other , slowly clumping together , getting hotter and increasing its gravitational pull . As this clump grew in mass , it began the process of nuclear fusion again . The birth of a second , much smaller star from what was left of the first . Now , still spewed around this young star is all the thinner regions of the cloud of atoms . The gravity of the star , combined with centrifugal ( spinning ) force , began swirling the cloud into orbit around the star . The cloud , little by little , got thicker in places where all these atoms started clumping together . By centrifugal force and the even pull of gravity , these clumps were shaped into spheres , and became planets . Those closer to the sun are mostly made of dense iron - being heavier it was pulled closer by the new star - and those farther away are made from light , less dense gasses . In the earth 's case , a large body of molten iron was surrounded by a thin cover of mostly hydrogen and helium . As the earth began to cool , forming the crust , volcanoes were erupting intensely over the surface , spilling forth water vapour , carbon dioxide , methane and ammonia . A bit more cooling and bodies of water started to form , early oceans that were void of oxygen . The earth was in this state 3.5 - 4 billion years ago . Through electrical activity ( lightening ) , and the combining of early atmosphere gasses with the new oceans , and the odd atom of phosphorous that was kicking around , the first few basic building blocks of life were created . This pre - biotic soup , as it is known , consisted of a few amino acids and a couple of RNA bases . Add a few hundred million years , a few of these building blocks had formed into self - replicating molecules . A few of these molecules became bound together in an enclosed membrane , complete with instructions for copying itself , and life began . These very early bacteria - formed around 3 billion years ago - was the starting point for every living this on earth . Basic biological and biochemical processes were worked out . 2.7 - 2.2 billion years ago , the most important of biological process was worked out - photosynthesis . Suddenly , bacteria could create energy rich molecules using abundant CO2 and sunlight . But more importantly , they started mass producing oxygen . Oxygen changed everything . Much more energy was utilised when respiring with oxygen , and that meant life could replicate and diversify much much quicker . Bacteria started compartmentalizing regions of there cells , increasing efficiency . Some cells started collaborating , increasing survival , and some of these multi - celled organisms developed specialized regions , allowing them to out compete others . The rest came down to survival of the fittest , with the most diversified most likely to reproduce and pass on those characteristics . Add another billion years or so , and that led to you .""]","[""Hydrogen doesn't turn into people directly. However, hydrogen is an important part of the process that allows living things, including people, to exist. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and it is found in many different places, including the sun and other stars. The sun is a giant ball of gas that is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, and it gives off light and heat. This light and heat are what allow life to exist on Earth. On Earth, plants use the energy from the sun to turn carbon dioxide and water into food through a process called photosynthesis. When plants make food, they use the energy from the sun to combine hydrogen and oxygen atoms from water molecules to form glucose, which is a type of sugar. Glucose is a source of energy for plants, and it is also a source of energy for animals that eat plants. So, in a way, hydrogen is an important part of the process that allows living things, including people, to exist because it is used by plants to make food. When animals eat plants, they get the energy from the food that the plants made using hydrogen, and that energy is used to fuel their bodies and keep them alive.""]",638.0,reddit_eli5,2245

Customers tend to pick PCs based on things like price and performance ( including running the OS of choice ) . It is hard for customers to gauge things like reliability , so it tends not to be the prime factor in making a buying decision . PC makers want to keep warranty returns within an acceptable range without incurring a lot of extra engineering and manufacturing expense . And they want to emphasize the things that will get consumers to buy their machine . So as a result , they spend just enough on engineering to make it likely that the PC will last long enough . It \'s a business decision . This also has historically worked out for the industry because the ever increasing processing power of microelectronics has meant that after a few years , a PC is considered "" old "" and "" slow "" .

Some of those components, like the hard drive or the battery, can wear out over time with use. Others, like the processor or the memory, can become outdated as technology advances and newer, more powerful components become available. Because of these limitations, computers typically don't last forever. However, with proper care and maintenance, you can often extend the lifespan of your computer by keeping it clean, making sure it has adequate ventilation, and using it in a way that doesn't put too much strain on its components. It's also worth noting that the average lifespan of a computer can vary depending on the type of computer and how it's used.

Washington told him to talk to Jefferson , the secretary of state . Jefferson proffered that he 'd help Hamilton if Hamilton agreed to move the capital to somewhere near Virginia .

And yes , the absolutely can change , it \'s just not as common nowadays . For example , I \'ll take you through the history of Georgia \'s capitals ( since I live here ) . Savannah , on the coast , was the first city established in Georgia , and it was the de facto "" capital "" during the time when we were still a colony ( since we were technically governed by England , but the royal governor sat in Savannah ) . When we became a state , Savannah was named the state capital mostly because it always had been . As the state expanded , the population started shifting west and so Augusta , a little further up and west , was chosen as the next capital partially because it was nearer to the new center of the population and partially because it had served as a rotating capital with Savannah whenever the British were constantly laying siege to it during the Revolution . Augusta was the capital for a little bit before they moved it to Louisville , which did n\'t amount to much . In 1802 , governor John Milledge sent out a party to find the new geographic center of the state and there they would establish the new capital . The surveyors found a natural spring bubbling up close enough to the center , and so decided to establish Milledgeville as the new capital ( and eventually my home town :D ) . Milledgeville served as capital through the Civil War , until 1868 . During Reconstruction , the military governor of Georgia ordered new delegates to meet in Atlanta . Atlanta became the official capital for a few reasons . First , it was a rebirth from being burned down by General Sherman ( even open - minded , progressive liberals in Georgia gag at the mention of his name ) , and it gave Georgia a new start away from its Confederate capital . Also , Milledgeville is surrounded by hills , which made it hard as hell for trains to get in . Atlanta , on the other hand , is relatively flat and actually began life as a train hub called Terminus . It also was a bigger , more modern city on the rise .

TL;DR : It \'s the legislature deciding where to put the capital , and they can change relatively simply . They just do n\'t tend to anymore .', 'There \'s a whole load of explanations for why a city ends up being the capital of a country . It \'s not necessarily because it was explicitly chosen . For example the Roman empire started out as a the city state of Rome . So naturally Rome was the capital of the empire .

A lot of old countries do n\'t have a process for choosing a capital city , because it has "" always "" been where it is .

It is often chosen to be in a central location within the state, province, or country, so that it is easily accessible to all parts of the region. \nSometimes, the capital city is chosen because it is already an important economic or cultural center. For example, London is the capital of the United Kingdom because it is a major financial and cultural center. \nIn some cases, the capital city may be changed by the government.

The bad : The same protections that keep good workers from being fired unjustly , also sadly can help a bad worker stay on because it \'s more difficult to get rid of them , and there \'s a process that must be strictly followed to make it happen .

Feel free to ask if you want to know anything else specific .', 'The only issue I have ever had with the Union is when I worked for a Memory ( RAM ) company based out of San Jose in the mid 90 \'s . When negotiations started for the new contract the union demanded Pay raises across the board based on the fact that the company had increased its profits every year for the last three years . The CEO combated that with "" If we lose money for the next three years are you going to demand a pay cut across the board ? "" Of course there was dead silence . In the end they agreed to a pay increase that was about 10 % more than then the cost of living increase . About 2 years later the internet bubble burst and sales dropped by 60 % in a three month time span . I got the hell out and went into the healthcare industry . When the time came to renegotiate the Union again asked for a cost of living increase , the CFO opened the books and showed them it was impossible , they had the numbers in their hands and still demanded it . The company was closed , everyone out of work . A few years ago I ran into the old CEO at a trade show , he drunkenly confessed that it was a more profitable move to close the company and sale the customer list and walk away . He was originally the one that brought the union in . I never personally had to deal with the union directly , but I did have to deal with poor employee \'s that continued to work there because the union protected them . I am not saying this behavior is normal or on par with all unions , but it was the experience I had and it has left a bad taste in my mouth 10 + years later . I work in Health care now as an engineer , I work with several union employees that are rock stars at what they do , but I still have a bit of prejudiced against them because they are union . Maybe I will never get over it . Maybe I am in a different place , but it has been my experience that the more money I help the company make , the more money and free time they are willing to give me , I do n\'t need to threaten to strike if I do n\'t get a raise , Ill just leave if they do n\'t give me one . I would sooner die than allow someone to negotiate my pay for me , and I would personally be humiliated if my boss wanted me out but could not fire me because some lawyer was protecting me . Again maybe I am just fortunate in my life and do n\'t understand the plights of some . I wo nt say I am against the Labor Unions , but I do have some trust issues with them . Sorry OP the best I can do is offer you my experiences , I really ca nt answer as to why there is so much negativity towards the unions in the states .']","[""Labor unions are organizations that represent workers and negotiate with employers on issues such as wages, benefits, and working conditions. While some people view labor unions positively because they can help improve the lives of workers, others view them negatively for various reasons.\n\nOne reason some people view labor unions negatively is because they may believe that unions have too much power and influence. For example, if a union goes on strike (stops working to protest an issue), it can disrupt the operations of a company and negatively impact the company's customers and profits. This can cause tensions between unions and management.\n\nAnother reason some people view labor unions negatively is because they may believe that unions are too expensive or that they require workers to pay union dues, which can be a burden for some workers.\n\nIt's also possible that some people view labor unions negatively because they may have had a negative personal experience with a union, or because they have heard negative things about unions from others.\n\nOverall, it's important to understand that labor unions can be both positive and negative, and that different people may have different opinions about them. It's also important to remember that unions exist to advocate for the rights and interests of workers, and that they can be a valuable resource for workers who want to improve their working conditions and advocate for fair treatment on the job.""]",,reddit_eli5,16969

How AI technology works in first / third person shooter videogames ? How do AI characters react to your moves in shooter videogames ? Also how do difficulty levels work for AI ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Valve has published a [ slide deck ( PDF ) ] ( URL_0 ) on how they designed the AI for Left 4 Dead . It \'s a bit more on the technical side if that \'s what you \'re interested in . Difficulty levels are just based on how fast the AI reacts and how much error you allow it to have . It \'s really easy to make the "" perfect "" AI because the computer always knows exactly where you are . So to make the game playable , you have to make the AI more stupid- it has to have some random error in its shots and you have to simulate some form of "" vision "" and reaction time or else the bad guys will just snipe you with a hitscan weapon from across the map as soon as the game starts . For a more difficult game , you just turn down the stupid factor .', ""Disclaimer : not an A.I. programmer , but this is my understanding of how you can go about it . There may be better ways to script an A.I. Typically you are programming a series of ' If this Then that ' statements . There can be levels of complexity in how this is done , but it can be generalized somewhat to ' If- > Then ' . For example , lets assume that we have a PlayerChar object that can return its location . We can check if it is in range , aim at it , and fire at that location IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { aimAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; fireAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; } would check if the Player 's Character is within the AI characters ' range ' , ' aim ' at that location , and ' fire ' at that location . You might also program the A.I. to look for cover . Lets assume we have an array that stores nearby objects that are ' cover ' , and can choose randomly from that array to decide where to hide before moving to that location IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { coverArray = searchForCover(me.location ) ; cover = pickRandom(coverArray ) ; moveToLocation(cover.location ) ; IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { aimAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; fireAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; } } Using logical steps in that manner , we could program a very basic enemy A.I. that checks for an enemy in range , looks for cover , moves to cover , and begins to aim and fire at the player . Depending on the complexity of the A.I. these logical steps can get very , very complicated , and have a lot of checks and special logic , e.g A.I. can only detect in a particular cone of view , they can detect sound , vision , they can react to alarms and move to that location , so on and so forth . With difficulty levels , what you might adjust is how well the A.I. reacts . Maybe they have better range , a wider cone of vision , maybe they pick better cover , or are more ' intelligent ' with how they react to your presence . For example , at a lower difficulty , I might allow the A.I. to have more of a delay before searching for cover . But at a higher difficulty , not only will they always run for cover , but they will coordinate with nearby A.I. to lay down alternating fire to keep your character suppressed . With programming an A.I , you usually already have the code for how the ' player ' character works . You now are designing code to do all the things a ' player ' character can do , but automatically based on known inputs ( e.g. the player moves into range , an alarm goes off , an event script tells the A.I. where to go , etc . )"", ""There is really no single answer to this question : shooter video games are not all exactly alike , and even small changes in the game ( available weapon choices , player abilities , common features and motifs in maps ) could require somewhat different behavior from the AI in order to make sense . For example , a shooter with many splash damage weapons would require effective AI to actively try to avoid standing too close to other AI bots , while this would not be a factor in shooters that mostly involve high accuracy , slow firing weapons . Now , this is a gross simplification ( especially since I have limited knowledge of Artificial Intelligence techniques and no knowledge of game - oriented AI ) but a reasonable model for the AI could be a classical State - based representation of the world . State - based representation means that at any given point in time , the algorithm ruling the bot will consider all sorts of various factors ( distance from player , line of sight , player 's equipped weapon , map topography etc ) and use some pre - defined function in order to evaluate the Value of that state ( the higher the value , the more likely the bot will want to be in that state ) . The bot will then evaluate some ( or all ) of its available moves , create many estimates for the possible states that will be created as a result ( and estimate the probability of each hypothetical state ) , and then use another computation ( such as the average state value , or the maximal minimum if the AI wants to minimize risk to itself ) in order to finally select what move to perform . This action is repeated between every two moves the bot performs . It 's not always a very hard computation -- mostly it depends on how many moves deep the algorithm will consider . Having such a system in place , it is possible to tweak the AI 's difficulty level by introducing errors , limiting the amount of moves considered , limiting options at specific instances or even explicitly forcing the algorithm to make sub - optimal choices , say , 5 % of the time . Naturally many , many other types of AIs exist . What I covered is really just a tip of the iceberg .""]","['In a first/third person shooter video game, the AI characters are computer-controlled characters that move and act in the game.

For example, some people have brown eyes and some people have blue eyes. If a mom and a dad with brown eyes have a baby, the baby might have brown eyes too.

Maybe the baby will have a new trait that no one in its family has ever had before. This can happen because of something called a mutation, which is a change in the genes that control how a living thing looks and acts. Mutations can be small, like a change in the color of a flower, or big, like a change in the shape of a beak.\r\n\r\nOver time, living things with traits that help them survive and have babies will have more babies than living things with traits that don't help them survive. This is because the living things with helpful traits are more likely to survive and pass their traits down to their babies.\r\n\r\nSo, over many, many years, the traits of a group of living things can change.

What is a computer ' memory leak ' ? I see it 's a huge issue with PC software but have no clue what it means . Can someone kindly explain it to me in simple terms please Explain like I'm five. ,"['Modern operating systems let you run multiple programs at once , but you only have one pool of RAM that they all have to share . The way that works is that when a program wants memory , it asks the operating system for however much it needs , and the OS finds a block that \'s not being used and loans it to the program . When the program is done using the memory , it \'s supposed to return it so other programs can use it . A memory leak happens when a program forgets about a block of memory the operating system gave it . As far as the operating system is concerned , it still has that block "" checked out "" , but the program ca n\'t do anything with it , and it ca n\'t return it back to the operating system because it ca n\'t find it . The memory is n\'t gone permanently- when the program exits , the operating system knows it does n\'t need the memory any more so it marks all the memory that was checked out by the program as "" available "" again . But it \'s not going to be available as long as that program is still running . It \'s only a big problem if the program keeps doing this . If it keeps hitting the code where it asks for more memory , but never returns any of it . Since it \'s not giving any memory back , the program will , over time , consume more and more of your computer \'s memory until you do n\'t have any more memory to give it . At that point , the computer has three choices : 1 . It can start rejecting requests from programs that ask for more memory ( which generally results in those programs crashing ) 2 . It can try storing additional data on the hard drive , which keeps the computer running but is something like 1000x slower than RAM so your computer will slow to a crawl 3 . It can try to figure out which program is stealing all of the memory and terminate that one ( Linux does this , Mac and Windows do n\'t since some programs do n\'t deal well with not having time to clean up ) EDIT : formatting', ""Software developer here , Memory is a finite resource , your computer has only so much of it . Every program needs memory , and it 's use has to be coordinated to ensure no two programs overwrite each other . That coordination typically happens through the OS as the mediator between all other programs and memory . Every program keeps track of what memory addresses it 's using . Typically , when a program needs memory , it will request what it needs , and when it 's done with that memory , it will release it back into the pool of available memory . Most programs , it 's the responsibility of the programmer to allocate and free the memory . Oversights are common , and an algorithm may allocate memory without releasing it when finished . The OS does n't know the program is done with that memory , it does n't know there 's an error that is allocating without releasing memory , and the program error may be such that the program loses track of which bytes it no longer needs , and now it ca n't release it back to the OS . This is a memory leak . The pool of memory is slowly draining . This can bog down your system until the offending process is killed and the allocated memory can be reclaimed , if other processes do n't themselves start failing ."", 'I think the best ELI5 would be to equate a computer as a teacher , and computer programs as little students .

"Please explain what is ""Symbolic AI""","['In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. \nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel\'s Checker\'s Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant\'s PAC learning, Quinlan\'s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]\nNeural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt\'s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn\'t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]']","['Symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and logic-based methods to solve problems. It is also sometimes referred to as ""classical AI"" or ""good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI).""\n\n\n\nIn symbolic AI, problems are solved by manipulating symbols according to a set of rules. The symbols represent concepts or entities in the problem domain, and the rules represent the relationships between those concepts or entities. For example, a symbolic AI system might be designed to solve a puzzle by representing the different pieces of the puzzle as symbols and using rules to manipulate those symbols and find a solution.\n\n\n\nSymbolic AI systems are often based on first-order logic, which allows them to represent and reason about the properties of objects and the relationships between them. This makes them well-suited for tasks that require logical reasoning and problem-solving, such as natural language processing, planning, and theorem proving.\n\n\n\nHowever, symbolic AI systems have some limitations. They can be difficult to design and implement, and they may require a large amount of human-generated knowledge to be encoded into the system. In addition, they can be inflexible and may not be able to handle uncertainty or handle tasks that require a lot of data or sensory input.\n\n\n\nToday, symbolic AI is often used in combination with other AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, in order to improve their performance and overcome some of their limitations.']",,wiki_csai,18317

The computer would then run a simulation of the brain\'s information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a sentient conscious mind.\nSubstantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain–computer interfaces, connectomics, and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains.  According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but say they are still in the realm of engineering possibility.\nMind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: copy-and-upload or copy-and-delete by gradual replacement of neurons (which can be considered as a gradual destructive uploading), until the original organic brain no longer exists and a computer program emulating the brain takes control over the body. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by storing and copying, that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process or may be deliberately destroyed during it in some variants of uploading. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in a computer inside (or either connected to or remotely controlled) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological or cybernetic body.\nAmong some futurists and within the part of transhumanist movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension or immortality technology (known as ""digital immortality""). Some believe mind uploading is humanity\'s current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to cryonics. Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our ""mind-file"", to enable interstellar space travel, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a computing device. Whole-brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a ""logical endpoint"" of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI (artificial general intelligence) and to at least weak superintelligence. Another approach is seed AI, which would not be based on existing brains. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a technological singularity, meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology. Mind uploading is a central conceptual feature of numerous science fiction novels, films, and games.']","[""Whole brain emulation, also known as mind uploading or brain uploading, is the hypothetical process of transferring the information from a biological brain to a computer-based system or device, with the goal of achieving artificial intelligence or creating a virtual copy of an individual's consciousness.

As its name indicates, the PRAM is intended as the parallel-computing analogy to the random-access machine (RAM) (not to be confused with random-access memory). In the same way that the RAM is used by sequential-algorithm designers to model algorithmic performance (such as time complexity), the PRAM is used by parallel-algorithm designers to model parallel algorithmic performance (such as time complexity, where the number of processors assumed is typically also stated). Similar to the way in which the RAM model neglects practical issues, such as access time to cache memory versus main memory, the PRAM model neglects such issues as synchronization and communication, but provides any (problem-size-dependent) number of processors. Algorithm cost, for instance, is estimated using two parameters O(time) and O(time × processor_number).']","['A parallel random-access machine (PRAM) is an abstract model of a computer that can perform multiple operations simultaneously.

His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had ""an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960."" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.\nFodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation.[citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.\nFor Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or ""organs"", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the ""central processing"" part of the mind, which has a more global and less ""domain specific"" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.:\u200a73–75\u200a\nAlthough Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.']","['Jerry Fodor was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist.

In other words, a random field is said to be a Markov random field if it satisfies Markov properties. The concept originates from the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model.\nA Markov network or MRF is similar to a Bayesian network in its representation of dependencies; the differences being that Bayesian networks are directed and acyclic, whereas Markov networks are undirected and may be cyclic. Thus, a Markov network can represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network cannot (such as cyclic dependencies[further explanation needed]); on the other hand, it can't represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network can (such as induced dependencies[further explanation needed]). The underlying graph of a Markov random field may be finite or infinite.\nWhen the joint probability density of the random variables is strictly positive, it is also referred to as a Gibbs random field, because, according to the Hammersley–Clifford theorem, it can then be represented by a Gibbs measure for an appropriate (locally defined) energy function. The prototypical Markov random field is the Ising model; indeed, the Markov random field was introduced as the general setting for the Ising model.

"Please explain what is ""Computational complexity""","['In computer science, the computational complexity or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it. Particular focus is given to computation time (generally measured by the number of needed elementary operations) and memory storage requirements. The complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow solving the problem.\nThe study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called analysis of algorithms, while the study of the complexity of problems is called computational complexity theory. Both areas are highly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound on the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm. Moreover, for designing efficient algorithms, it is often fundamental to compare the complexity of a specific algorithm to the complexity of the problem to be solved. Also, in most cases, the only thing that is known about the complexity of a problem is that it is lower than the complexity of the most efficient known algorithms. Therefore, there is a large overlap between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. \nAs the amount of resources required to run an algorithm generally varies with the size of the input, the complexity is typically expressed as a function n → f(n), where n is the size of the input and f(n) is either the worst-case complexity (the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed over all inputs of size n) or the average-case complexity (the average of the amount of resources over all inputs of size n). Time complexity is generally expressed as the number of required elementary operations on an input of size n, where elementary operations are assumed to take a constant amount of time on a given computer and change only by a constant factor when run on a different computer.

The term ""intellectual property"" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world\'s legal systems.\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to benefit from the information and intellectual goods they create, and allows them to protect their ideas and prevent copying. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.[10]\nThe intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is ""indivisible"", since an unlimited number of people can ""consume"" an intellectual good without its being depleted.[11][page\xa0needed] Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: Landowners can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but producers of information or literature can usually do little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price.

Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.\nQuantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization); objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality); and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).\nQuantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations which could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck\'s solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein\'s 1905 paper which explained the photoelectric effect. These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the ""old quantum theory"", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Paul Dirac and others.

"Please explain what is ""Natural selection""","['Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations. Charles Darwin popularised the term ""natural selection"", contrasting it with artificial selection, which in his view is intentional, whereas natural selection is not.\nVariation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and their offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Because individuals with certain variants of the trait tend to survive and reproduce more than individuals with other less successful variants, the population evolves. Other factors affecting reproductive success include sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.\nNatural selection acts on the phenotype, the characteristics of the organism which actually interact with the environment, but the genetic\n(heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives that phenotype a reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation  (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.\nNatural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin\'s influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin\'s writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.']","[""Natural selection is a process that occurs in nature as a result of certain inherited traits being more or less advantageous for an individual's survival and reproduction in a particular environment. These advantageous traits tend to be passed on to future generations, while disadvantageous traits tend to be selected against and are less likely to be passed on. This process ultimately leads to the evolution of species over time.\n\n\n\nThe theory of natural selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century, and it remains one of the most important concepts in the field of biology. According to the theory, natural selection occurs because individuals within a population vary in their traits, and some of these traits are more advantageous than others in a particular environment. For example, a population of gazelles that live in a grassland habitat may have individuals with longer legs, which allow them to run faster and escape from predators more effectively. These individuals would be more likely to survive and reproduce, and as a result, the trait of long legs would be more common in the population over time.\n\n\n\nNatural selection is one of the main mechanisms of evolution, and it has shaped the diversity of life on Earth as we know it today.""]",,wiki_csai,18796

Good\'s intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.\nThe first person to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\nThe concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to ""the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole"", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\'s 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction.[10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\nProminent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.[12] One claim made was that the artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.']","['The technological singularity is a hypothetical future event that is associated with the creation of superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI).

Convolutional neural networks, in the context of computer vision, can be seen as a GNN applied to graphs structured as grids of pixels. Transformers, in the context of natural language processing, can be seen as GNNs applied to complete graphs whose nodes are words in a sentence.\nThe key design element of GNNs is the use of pairwise message passing, such that graph nodes iteratively update their representations by exchanging information with their neighbors.

However, while problems associated with ""mixture distributions"" relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations, ""mixture models"" are used to make statistical inferences about the properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled population, without sub-population identity information.\nMixture models should not be confused with models for compositional data, i.e., data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value (1, 100%, etc.). However, compositional models can be thought of as mixture models, where members of the population are sampled at random. Conversely, mixture models can be thought of as compositional models, where the total size reading population has been normalized to 1.']","['A mixture model is a probabilistic model that represents a combination of multiple probability distributions. It is a flexible tool for modeling data that can be represented as a mixture of different underlying distributions.\n\n\n\nIn a mixture model, the data is assumed to be generated by a mixture of different probability distributions, rather than a single distribution. Each of these distributions is referred to as a component of the mixture model. The mixture model assigns a weight to each component, indicating the probability that a data point was generated by that component. The weights sum to 1, and they represent the probability that a data point was generated by each of the components.\n\n\n\nMixture models are commonly used in a variety of applications, including density estimation, clustering, and classification. They are particularly useful when the data exhibits complex structure or when it is not clear which probability distribution best describes the data.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a set of data points that represent the heights of individuals in a population. It is possible that the heights of the individuals in this population are distributed according to a normal distribution, but it is also possible that the distribution is more complex, with multiple modes or outliers.

It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.\nSome speech recognition systems require ""training"" (also called ""enrollment"") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person\'s specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person\'s speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called ""speaker-independent"" systems. Systems that use training are called ""speaker dependent"".\nSpeech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. ""call home""), call routing (e.g. ""I would like to make a collect call""), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).\nThe term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person\'s voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.\nFrom the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations.

"Please explain what is ""Approximate computing""","['Approximate computing is an emerging paradigm for energy-efficient and/or high-performance design. It includes a plethora of computation techniques that return a possibly inaccurate result rather than a guaranteed accurate result, and that can be used for applications where an approximate result is sufficient for its purpose. One example of such situation is for a search engine where no exact answer may exist for a certain search query and hence, many answers may be acceptable. Similarly, occasional dropping of some frames in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing bounded approximation can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy.[clarification needed]  For example, in k-means clustering algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification.\nThe key requirement in approximate computing is that approximation can be introduced only in non-critical data, since approximating critical data (e.g., control operations) can lead to disastrous consequences, such as program crash or erroneous output.']","['Approximate computing is a computing paradigm that involves intentionally introducing errors or uncertainty into computing systems in order to reduce resource consumption or improve performance. In approximate computing, the goal is not to achieve the most accurate or precise results, but rather to find a satisfactory solution that is good enough for the given task at hand.\n\n\n\nApproximate computing can be applied at various levels of the computing stack, including hardware, software, and algorithms. At the hardware level, approximate computing can involve the use of low-precision or error-prone components in order to reduce power consumption or increase the speed of computation. At the software level, approximate computing can involve the use of algorithms that trade off accuracy for efficiency, or the use of heuristics or approximations to solve problems more quickly.\n\n\n\nApproximate computing has a number of potential applications, including in embedded systems, mobile devices, and high-performance computing. It can also be used to design more efficient machine learning algorithms and systems.

The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field.[d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations.
