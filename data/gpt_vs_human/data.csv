What does the idea of effective nuclear charge tell us,"['The term ""effective"" is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevents higher orbital electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge by the repelling effect of inner-layer electrons.']","[""Effective nuclear charge (also known as effective atomic number) is a concept used in chemistry to describe the net positive charge experienced by an electron in an atom. The effective nuclear charge is a measure of the overall attraction between an electron and the nucleus of an atom, taking into account the shielding effect of other electrons in the atom.\\n\\nThe effective nuclear charge can be used to explain the chemical behavior of an element, as it determines the strength of the attraction between an electron and the nucleus. Elements with a high effective nuclear charge tend to have higher electronegativities and be more likely to form chemical bonds, while elements with a lower effective nuclear charge tend to have lower electronegativities and be less likely to form chemical bonds.\\n\\nEffective nuclear charge is also a key factor in determining the properties of an element's electron cloud, including the energy levels of its electrons and the shapes of its atomic and molecular orbitals. Understanding the effective nuclear charge can help chemists predict the behavior of atoms and molecules, which is important in many fields including medicine, materials science, and environmental science."", ""The idea of effective nuclear charge is a concept used in chemistry to describe the effective positive charge experienced by an electron in a molecule or an atom. It is a measure of the net positive charge that an electron experiences due to the presence of the nucleus and the other electrons in the atom or molecule.\\n\\nEffective nuclear charge is a useful concept because it allows us to understand and predict the behavior of electrons in an atom or molecule. For example, the effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron in an atom or molecule can influence the electron's energy level and its ability to participate in chemical reactions.\\n\\nEffective nuclear charge is typically calculated using a combination of quantum mechanical principles and empirical data. The value of the effective nuclear charge for a given electron can be affected by the presence of other electrons, the shielding effect of the inner electrons, and the size of the atom or molecule.\\n\\nIn general, the effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron increases as the number of protons in the nucleus increases, as the electron is attracted to the positive charge of the nucleus. The effective nuclear charge also increases as the number of other electrons in the atom or molecule decreases, because there are fewer electrons to shield the positive charge of the nucleus."", 'The effective nuclear charge (also known as the effective atomic number) is a concept used in chemistry to describe the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom. It takes into account the shielding effect of inner electrons, which reduces the net positive charge experienced by outer electrons.\\n\\nThe effective nuclear charge is important because it determines the strength of the attraction between the nucleus and the outer electrons, which in turn affects the energy levels of the electrons and the chemical properties of the atom. For example, atoms with a higher effective nuclear charge tend to have a higher ionization energy (the energy required to remove an electron from the atom), and they also tend to have a greater affinity for electrons (a measure of their ability to gain or share electrons in chemical reactions).\\n\\nThe effective nuclear charge can be calculated using the following formula:\\n\\nEffective nuclear charge = (Number of protons in the nucleus) - (Number of inner-shell electrons)\\n\\nThis formula takes into account the fact that inner-shell electrons shield outer-shell electrons from the full positive charge of the nucleus, reducing the net positive charge experienced by the outer-shell electrons.

how deep can be drill for deep underwater,['Deepwater drilling is the process of oil and gas exploration and production in depths of more than 500 feet.'],"['The depth at which drilling is possible underwater depends on a variety of factors, including the type of drilling equipment being used, the type of formation being drilled, and the ambient pressure at the depth at which drilling is occurring.\\n\\nIn general, drilling equipment used for deepwater drilling must be designed to withstand the high ambient pressure at depths of several thousand meters. For example, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which suffered a catastrophic explosion in 2010, was drilling at a depth of around 1,500 meters (5,000 feet). Other drilling operations have taken place at depths of several kilometers, using specialized drilling equipment and techniques.\\n\\nIt is also worth noting that drilling at great depths can be challenging due to the extreme conditions and the technical difficulties involved. Deepwater drilling operations require specialized equipment, highly trained personnel, and extensive planning and safety measures to ensure the safety of workers and the integrity of the drilling equipment.', 'There are several factors that determine how deep a drill can go underwater, including the type of drill being used, the materials being drilled through, and the environmental conditions.\\n\\nOne type of drill that is commonly used for deep underwater drilling is a submersible drilling rig. These rigs are designed to operate at depths of up to 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) and are used for a variety of purposes, including oil and gas exploration, construction, and scientific research.\\n\\nOther types of drills, such as diamond core drills, can also be used for deep underwater drilling, although they are generally not as effective as submersible drilling rigs.\\n\\nThe materials being drilled through can also impact the depth at which a drill can operate. For example, drilling through solid rock may require a more powerful drill or specialized drilling techniques, while drilling through softer materials like sand or mud may be easier.\\n\\nFinally, the environmental conditions can also affect the depth at which a drill can operate. Factors such as water pressure, temperature, and currents can all impact the ability of a drill to function effectively at deeper depths.\\n\\nOverall, the depth at which a drill can operate underwater is largely dependent on the specific equipment and techniques being used, as well as the materials and environmental conditions present.', 'The maximum depth at which a drill can operate underwater depends on several factors, including the type of drill being used, the strength and durability of the drill and its components, and the pressure and conditions at the drilling site.

how was color introduced in film?,['The first color cinematography was by means of additive color systems such as the one patented in England by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899 and tested in 1902.A simplified additive system was developed by George Albert Smith and successfully commercialized in 1909 as Kinemacolor .'],"['Color has been used in films for almost as long as the medium itself has existed. One of the earliest examples of color in film is the 1895 film ""The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station"" by the Lumière brothers, which used a color process known as Autochrome Lumière. This process involved placing a layer of microscopic potato starch grains, each dyed red, green, or blue, over a black and white film stock, which would filter the light passing through the film and create a color image.\\n\\nOver the years, various other color processes were developed, including hand-coloring, two-color systems, and three-color systems. However, it wasn\'t until the 1950s that color films became the norm, thanks to the development of more advanced color film stocks and processes, such as Eastmancolor and Technicolor. Today, most films are shot and exhibited in color, although some filmmakers still choose to shoot in black and white for artistic or thematic reasons.', 'Color film has been around since the late 1800s, but it wasn\'t until the 1930s that it became widely used in motion pictures. The first feature-length color film was ""The Gulf Between,"" which was produced by the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation and released in 1917. However, this film was not commercially successful and it wasn\'t until the 1930s that color film became more widely used.\\n\\nOne of the first successful color films was ""The Wizard of Oz,"" which was released in 1939. This film used the Technicolor process, which involved shooting the film on black and white film stock and then using a special camera to record color information on a separate strip of film. This process was used for many years, but it was eventually replaced by more advanced techniques such as Eastman Color and Technicolor\'s dye transfer process.\\n\\nIn the 1950s, Eastman Kodak introduced a new color film stock called Kodacolor, which made it easier and cheaper to produce color films. This helped to further popularize the use of color in motion pictures. Today, the vast majority of films are shot in color, and the use of black and white is mostly reserved for artistic or stylistic purposes.', 'Color has been a part of the film industry since its inception, but the technology for capturing and displaying color images has evolved significantly over time.\\n\\nOne of the earliest methods for adding color to film was the use of hand-colored black and white prints. This was a labor-intensive process in which individual frames of the film were colored by hand using dyes or paints. This method was used as early as the 1900s, but it was not widely adopted due to the time and cost involved.\\n\\nAnother early method for adding color to film was the use of color filters. This technique involved shooting the film using black and white film stock and then using color filters to alter the light that passed through the camera lens. This method was used in the 1920s and 1930s, but it was not very effective at reproducing realistic colors and was eventually abandoned.\\n\\nThe first successful method for adding color to film was the Technicolor process, which was developed in the 1920s. This process involved shooting the film using special Technicolor film stock and then using a complex process to produce color prints from the black and white negatives. Technicolor was used to produce many of the most iconic color films of the 20th century, including ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.""\\n\\nToday, most films are shot using digital cameras and are automatically captured in color.

Why do we have separate tax brackets ? Would n't it be easier if we had a flat percentage taken out across the board for individuals ? . Explain like I'm five.,"[""There is a concept of marginal utility -- the first dollar is more important than later dollars . If you are homeless , having a dumpy studio is a more beneficial than middle manager being able to upgrade from a 3BR house to a 5BR house . Having food to eat is more important than whether you eat chicken breast or splurge on the steak . And so on ... So the lower earnings dollars are more critical to the basic necessities of life and are thus taxed at a lower rate than dollars earned where they are going to be spent on qualitative enhancements rather than necessities . To keep a tax rate even among all income , then you 'd need to tax people making minimum wage way more then they pay today , when they are already living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to make ends meet -- all while taxing lower taxes from those making six , seven , eight figures or more . Does it sound fair for somebody making $ 15k pay more taxes while cutting the taxes of somebody making $ 1.5 million ? And by the way , tax rates are marginal , too ... this means that everybody pays the same rate on the same dollars earned . If you 're in the top tax bracket , which is 39.6 % you only pay that rate on the dollars you earn over $ 418,400 where that tax rate kicks in -- you DO NOT pay that rate on your entire income . So if you earned $ 50k and somebody else made $ 500k , you 'd both pay the same rate on the first $ 50k earned ."", ""There are two basic justifications for this . First , the idea is that in terms of the impact on someone 's lifestyle of losing a larger percentage of their income matters less as income increases . Second , and related , is that lower - income people are more likely to spend their money , and so taxing it at the same rate reduces economic demand ."", 'Tax brackets are simple way to create a progressive tax . The brackets are a simplification a alternative like a continuous mathematical function to calculate the tax for the income . The motivation of a progressive tax it that a flat tax is a higher budon for people with low income . Everyone need to spend money on the basic things needed to survive like food , housing etc . So a higher tax is is a higher budon for someone that make precisely enough to survive then for a person with twice the income and obvious less a budon for someone with ten time the income . A progressive tag is constructed so every one pays the same tax for the first $ 100 they earn regardless of their total income but the tax rate will be higher for the next $ 100 ( the amounts are just a example ) Som people might argue that a flat tax is more fare the a progressive tag . You could motivate the alternative and the amount the tax increases with income . But to say that we should use flat tax because it is a bit simpler to calculate it not a good way to motivate it . Argue instead for fairness or the ability for a person to pay tax not de difficulty of a simple calculation . To make tax simple you should have tax systems like it is often done in Europe . The tax form include most information already and for a significant part of the population the correct way for them to submit their taxes is to only sign the form .']","[""\\nTax brackets are a way to set different tax rates for different levels of income. The idea is to make the tax system more fair by making sure that people who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.\\n\\nHere's an example to help explain how tax brackets work:\\n\\nImagine that the tax rate is 10% for people who earn less than $50,000 per year, 20% for people who earn between $50,000 and $100,000 per year, and 30% for people who earn more than $100,000 per year.\\n\\nIf you earn $40,000 per year, you would be in the 10% tax bracket and would have to pay 10% of your income in taxes, which would be $4,000.\\n\\nIf you earn $60,000 per year, you would be in the 20% tax bracket and would have to pay 20% of your income in taxes, which would be $12,000.\\n\\nIf you earn $200,000 per year, you would be in the 30% tax bracket and would have to pay 30% of your income in taxes, which would be $60,000.\\n\\nThe reason we have tax brackets instead of a flat percentage for everyone is to make the tax system more progressive.

It is true that Native American cultures and histories have not always been well-represented or understood in mainstream education. There are several reasons for this. One reason is that the histories and cultures of Native American peoples have often been overshadowed by the narrative of European colonization and the creation of the United States. This narrative has often focused on the experiences and perspectives of European settlers and downplayed or excluded the perspectives and experiences of Native American peoples. Another reason is that the histories and cultures of Native American peoples have often not been well-documented or preserved. This is due in part to the fact that many Native American cultures were oral cultures, meaning that they passed down their histories and traditions through stories, songs, and other forms of oral tradition rather than through written records. This can make it more difficult to learn about Native American history compared to the histories of other groups that have more extensive written records. Finally, the histories and cultures of Native American peoples have often been impacted by trauma and violence, including forced removal from their lands, assimilation into mainstream culture, and the loss of many traditional ways of life. This has made it more challenging to preserve and pass on Native American histories and traditions. Overall, it is important to recognize and learn about the diverse histories and cultures of Native American peoples, and to work to ensure that these histories are accurately and respectfully represented in mainstream education.']",,reddit_eli5,14080
Why has n't China started phasing out symbolic writing and started standardizing phonetic ( pinyin 拼音 ) writing ? Would n't standardized pinyin as the primary written communication make it easier for Westerners to learn Chinese and for the Chinese to learn English ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Part of it is that while there is a unified Chinese * written * language , there are dozens ( maybe hundreds , I do n't know for sure ) of difference * spoken * Chinese languages ( i.e. dialects ) . Pinyin corresponds to Mandarin Chinese ( the official spoken language ) while there are many other dialects ( Cantonese , Shanghainese , Fujianese , etc . ) which will have the same written form as Mandarin , but are spoken completely differently . Having a unified character language makes things easier when communicating between different dialects ."", ""Yes but changing a few billion people 's written language for the sake of making it easier to learn a different language is n't something the Chinese government seems especially keen on doing ."", ""There 's quite a lot of writing in the old format -- several millenia of classic literature , history , and philosophy . As long as that writing system is still in common use , all of those books are relatively accessible to the population at large . If you change writing systems , suddenly you have a cultural divide between the present and the past . China does not want a culture divide between the present and the past . Its ability to function as a country is dependent on people perceiving themselves as part of the gigantic country of China . Part of that identity is continuity with the thousands of years of culture . The Chinese government implicitly takes legitimacy by association with the traditions that preceded it ( notwithstanding actual resemblance to those traditions ) . Breaking off from history may lead to a new cultural identity , and potentially one that is fragmented or locally - based rather than nationally unified . That is something the Chinese government wants to avoid .""]","['Pinyin is actually a standardized system for writing Chinese using the Roman alphabet, and it is widely used in China for teaching Chinese as a second language, transcribing proper nouns and place names, and as a tool for inputting Chinese characters on computers and phones. \nHowever, Pinyin is not used as the primary written form of Chinese. Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi or Kanji in Japanese) are the primary written form of Chinese and have a long history dating back over 3,000 years. They are still used today because they are an important part of Chinese culture and history, and they are also very efficient for written communication. \nOne of the main reasons that Pinyin is not used as the primary written form of Chinese is that it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words. Chinese characters, on the other hand, can convey the full meaning and pronunciation of a word in a single character. For example, the Chinese character for ""water"" is 水, which is pronounced ""shui"" in Mandarin. Pinyin cannot represent the meaning of the character, only the pronunciation. \nAdditionally, replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin as the primary written form of Chinese would be a massive undertaking that would involve changing the way that Chinese is taught in schools, updating dictionaries and other reference materials, and potentially requiring people to learn a new writing system. It would also be difficult to determine a standard way to represent the many different regional accents and dialects of Chinese using the Roman alphabet. \nIn summary, while Pinyin is a useful tool for learning Chinese and transcribing proper nouns, it is not used as the primary written form of Chinese because it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words, and replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin would be a major undertaking.']",,reddit_eli5,1157

Literally , his arm was almost a Z. He had limited usage of his fingers because of the way the tendons were situated afterwards and had a pretty limited range of motion for his wrist . He became predominantly left handed , as would be expected . I will have to try and dig up a picture of it ( if I still have the pic , that is ) . TL;DR , just go to the hospital . It can seriously fuck you up otherwise ."", ""Think of your bone as a bridge . When you break the bone , it 's like breaking the bridge in the middle .

If you aim the two ends of the bridge right at each other , or even put them back together with a cast , when the bridge adds more concrete , it wo n't have to add a lot and can heal quickly ( primary bone healing ) . If you never stop moving the two ends of the bridge , the bridge will never come back together , as shown in the video here with the humerus fracture .

It 's like connecting the bridge edges together with steel beams so that the bridge does not move at all , allowing the concrete to fill in directly with no movement . After the concrete fills in , you can either keep the steel plates or remove then , and you can remove the cast because it 's no longer needed . Bone heals in 4 - 6 weeks when immobilized .""]","[""If you break a bone and don't go to the hospital, it means that the bone is not being treated by a doctor. This can be a problem because the bone may not heal correctly. When a bone is broken, the body tries to fix it by creating new cells to mend the break. These new cells eventually turn into new bone, which helps the broken bone heal. However, if the bone is not properly aligned while it is healing, it may heal in the wrong position. This can cause the bone to be weaker and more prone to breaking again in the future. It can also cause the joint to not work properly, which can make it difficult to use your hand or wrist. If you think you have broken a bone, it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. The doctor will be able to tell you if you have a broken bone and how to best treat it so that it can heal properly.""]",344.0,reddit_eli5,1951
How does comedy writing work ? Comedians who write bits and jokes and what not . What is the process which goes into the development of a bit ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['It is much easier to find something funny about a topic than to simply come up with a funny thing on its own . Have you noticed how jokes effortlessly come to you in conversation ? It \'s because ideas are being thrown around , and your brain is automatically making connections with other stuff you know in the background . When trying to come up with jokes , the trick is to start from concepts , and only then craft comedy out of it . & nbsp ; Let \'s go with * * Dogs * * . I \'ll list some arbitrary facts about them . 1 . They are loyal to their owners regardless of the situation 2 . They eat disgusting things if given the opportunity 3 . They have a warped sense of time 4 . They ca n\'t eat chocolate 5 . Small ones are often more aggresive than larger ones 6 . They smell each others \' butts as a greeting 7 . They get happy and jittery very easily 8 . They hate the mailman 9 . They have a pack mentality & nbsp ; As you write concepts down , some straightforward bits might start forming on their own . 4 and 2 connect for a very obvious joke - the fact that dogs eat disgusting stuff all the time , but will get very sick if they eat a piece of chocolate . > Dogs make no sense . They will eat their own poop and vomit , spoiled food and all sorts of nasty shit and be fine - but give them a bit of chocolate ? They fucking die . > Like , "" Oh man , this dead pigeon tastes delicious ! But do n\'t give me that chocolate shit , that \'s disgusting "" & nbsp ; It \'s also a good idea to list inherently funny things related to a topic , and potential double entendres and wordplays to use : 1 . Dogs that make for funny mental images : * Chihuahuas , Pugs , Poodles * 2 . ~~Funny~~ Staple Dog Names : * Fido , Rex * ( Thanks /u / rewboss ! ) 3 . Potential double entendre : * Bitch * 4 . Potential wordplay : * Hot Dog * & nbsp ; For the next bit , I \'ll use number 6 with a funny dog name and a reference to the previous joke : > Is n\'t it weird how dogs sniff each other \'s butts as a way to greet each other ? "" What up Fido ? Smelling good today ! Had some dead pigeon last night , huh ? "" & nbsp ; Of course , if you want a lot of jokes , you will need a much longer list . You can search for more facts online , use or make up related stories , and keep adding more wordplay material . Referencing a previous joke is always a good idea , too . As you expand your list , new bits will form at an astonoshing rate . & nbsp ; Last but not least , remember that jokes will always seem stale on paper - the delivery is very important for them to work . In order to get good with that , you may want to watch some stand - up comedians do their magic . & nbsp ; * EDIT : Formatting * * EDIT 2 : This method is a simplification of something I learned from a [ Jerry Corley video ] ( URL_0 ) *', 'I define comedy as an intersection between reality and absurdity . You \'re essentially asking about what comedy is . A lot of old definitions hark back to such ideas ( young versus old , for instance ) . Comedians , specifically some of the best , talk about absurdities in reality , or inject absurdity into reality by taking turns you would n\'t expect . A lot of times it \'s about breaking the cooperative principle of language - which is to say , when people communicate , they \'re cooperating . Otherwise nothing they say would make sense . If you ask for the time and I say my phone is dead , years ago that would have made no sense . But now it does , and you have to cooperate intrinsically to understand that I \'m helping you with more information . Comedians often break these rules on purpose to mislead people from reality into absurdity . They set up a premise , and then "" tweak it "" .

Try to be funny in your stream of thought and fill out a page . This overall makes you a funnier person , when you look back and reread it you \'ll see 6 or 7 \' concepts \' that you can now reword more succinctly into a joke . It also sharpens your mind so that you can be funny more consistently and for longer , and that will reflect in your spoken words in conversation . As far as writing one - liner jokes go , see an object that you find peculiar , then just think about it , think about what relates to it , think of what is obscure about it and then put it one sentence . After you write 500 of those , spanning many different topics , pick out the 50 best ones or pair the jokes that share a common topic and reword them ( if possible ) so they fit more like a puzzle piece . This is how I do it and I think this is how Mitch Hedberg did it . When he says 3 one - liners in a row that are all on the same topic , it \'s likely that he wrote them at 3 different times , maybe years apart . This is an essential part of being a comedian , holding as many jokes in your working memory that you can and then recalling them upon the realization that they mesh well with other jokes/ topics , or saying them aloud in conversation ( it seemed so RANDOM of you to say that , but it \'s a joke you \'ve been subconsciously holding on to ) for that sweet gratifying laughter . The thing that compels you to keep making more jokes .']","[""Comedy writing is the process of creating jokes and comedic material. A comedian will often start by coming up with an idea or concept for a joke, and then they will brainstorm different ways to turn that idea into a funny joke or story. They might start by writing down their ideas in a notebook, or they might talk through their ideas with a friend or fellow comedian to get feedback and help them develop their ideas further. Once they have a strong idea, the comedian will then work on crafting the joke or bit, experimenting with different word choices and delivery methods to make the joke as funny as possible. This process can take a lot of trial and error, as the comedian will often need to try out different versions of the joke in front of an audience to see what works and what doesn't.""]",,reddit_eli5,7700

Nutrients are substances found in food that are necessary for our bodies to function properly. They include things like protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, and minerals. \nJunk food is often high in calories, but low in nutrients. While it may provide some energy, it does not provide the nutrients that our bodies need to stay healthy. People who eat a lot of junk food may be at risk for developing nutrient deficiencies, which can lead to a variety of health problems. These can include problems with growth and development, weak bones, and problems with the immune system. \nIt's important to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins.

How spiral arms form in galaxies Should n't it be like stirring hot chocolate powder in a cup ? Explain like I'm five.,"['The speed of rotation of a galaxy is a bit weird to say the least .

From the middle of the radius to the centre of the galaxy , speed again decreases . So what you have here is bits of matter ( gas , dust , planetary systems etc ) and stars which are held loosely together due to gravity . The matter bunched up into arms , due to the arrangement of the galactic magnetic fields . Due to the uneven rotation speed , the middle of these structures gets "" smeared "" all over the place , as the faster middle overtakes the slow centre and the edge . ps : Its a good thing we are living in a spiral galaxy , the other kinds of galaxies have virtually no heavy elements , hence , chances of intelligent life or even , higher forms of life is almost zero .', ""Here 's an interesting and relevant simulation that may help to visualise the process .

The main thing about 4 G is that it is ( or is going to be ) much faster than 3G. Phones require specific hardware ( antennas or chips ) to use 4G. As mentioned by kevtice15 , an international technology union ( the [ ITU - R ] ( URL_1 ) ) set out some goals for 4G. IIRC , T - Mobile started calling their 3 G network "" 4 G "" after an upgrade made it much faster . Other carriers joined in and eventually the ITU - R said , "" That 3 G is pretty advanced . I guess you guys can call it 4G. "" The ITU - R had two big goals that were n\'t being met : speed requirements , and a network that routes calls using Internet - based technology . Depending on your carrier , 4 G can mean different technologies and different levels of battery drainage ( although battery drainage also depends on a number of other factors ) . If you \'re with Verizon , AT & T , or Sprint , you \'re probably on LTE . LTE stands for "" Long Term Evolution "" and is the most widely used 4 G technology . It \'s really fast , and an upcoming update will make it much faster . T - Mobile is eventually going to launch 4 G as well . If you \'re with Sprint , you could also be on WiMax ; WiMax is basically Wi - Fi on steroids . It \'s very fast , but it \'s not very popular outside of the USA . If you \'re on T - Mobile or AT & T , you could also be on HSPA+ , which stands for "" High Speed Packet Access "" . It \'s basically 3 G but with a better internet connection . This is the network T - Mobile started calling "" 4 G "" . I suspect it will eventually be demoted to 3.75G. HSPA+ can download 84 [ Mbps ] ( URL_0 ) at its very maximum . Wi - Fi can go up to 150 Mbps , depending on the kind of Wi - Fi you \'re using . LTE and WiMax are capable of going faster than that , up to about 1 Gbps .

It is faster than 3G, which is the previous generation of cellular technology. When you are using 4G, you can expect faster internet speeds, which means that websites will load more quickly and you will be able to download and stream video and other content more smoothly.\n\nOne reason that 4G may be faster than WiFi is because it uses a different type of connection. WiFi is a wireless internet connection that relies on a router or other device to connect to the internet, while 4G is a cellular connection that uses a network of towers and antennas to connect to the internet. This means that 4G can be faster in some cases, especially if you are in an area with a strong 4G signal.\n\nIt's also possible that you are experiencing faster speeds with 4G because the network is less congested. When a lot of people are using the same WiFi network, it can slow down the connection for everyone. With 4G, you are connected to a specific tower and antenna, so there is less competition for bandwidth.\n\nOverall, 4G is a faster and more reliable way to connect to the internet, especially if you are in an area with a strong 4G signal. It is particularly useful for people who use their phones or other devices to do a lot of online activities, such as streaming video, downloading music, or playing online games.""]",,reddit_eli5,14958

There are many different types of antioxidants, and they can be found in a variety of foods and supplements. Some of the best sources of antioxidants include fruits and vegetables, especially those that are brightly colored like berries, oranges, and leafy greens. Other good sources include nuts, seeds, and whole grains. It\'s important to get enough antioxidants because they can help keep our bodies healthy and strong.

"Explain the rules of Cricket to me please ! What are the core rules of gameplay ? What is the difference between Test Matches and the other , shorter matches ? Explain like I'm five.","[""there are 11 players on each side , played on a big oval pitch ( a field with grass on ) . In the middle of the oval is a pale strip , where the bowler throws a cricket ball at a team of batsmen from the other side . He 's trying to smash the three wooden poles called wickets , with the ball , but sometimes the bowler tries to make the batsmen hit it in the air so that the bowlers teammates can catch the ball . If they catch the ball while it 's in the air , before it 's hit the ground , the batsman is out . The batsman tries to score runs . He hits the ball in different ways so that he and his teammate at the other end of the strip can run back and forward between the wickets and score runs . If he hits it off the pitch without it hitting the ground , he does n't have to run because he gets 6 runs automatically , and no more . If he hits it off the pitch but it DOES hit the floor , he gets 4 runs automatically , but no more . The bowler , and the fielders try to catch the ball and throw it back while the batsmen are out of their ' crease ' , which is a little safe zone they stand in next to the wicket . It 's a line drawn in white . If the batsmen gets put out by the other team , then one of the other 11 players takes up his place . In theory , they should go through all 11 players , and that brings an end to the ' innings ' . Innings can end early because the batting side can say ' we 've had enough ' , or because of bad weather . The bowler is allowed to bowl 6 times . That 's called an ' over ' . Wide balls , and no - deliveries do n't count . In some games , the number of ' overs ' is limited to a set number to shorten the game and make it more exciting . There are a few different kinds of bowling styles . Some people like to throw it really fast to hit the wickets . Some people like to spin the ball and make it go in different directions to get around the batsman or make him hit it badly . The bowler will do whatever he can to try and trick the batsman . There are a few ways the batsman can go out . -Hit the wickets with the ball -The fielders catch a hit ball before it touches the floor -Leg before wickets . The ball is definitely going to hit the wickets , but it hits the batsman 's leg first . -When the batters are scoring runs , and are out of their ' creases ' ( batters safe zone ) the fielders hit the wickets with the ball -The batsman hits his own wickets by accident -The batsman hits the ball twice ( rarely happens ) -Deliberately touches the ball -After a batsman gets put out , if the next one does n't arrive by 3 minutes , he 's out too . After everyone has batted , the teams swap , and whoever has scored the most runs , wins the game ! ! ! Hope this is a good basic guide . edit : to include pitch explanation"", 'One team bats while the other team bowls and fields . The team which is bowling tries to get all of the batsmen "" out "" in one of several ways : * Caught ( the batsman hits the ball with his bat or hand , and one of the fielders catches it before it touches the ground ) * Bowled ( the bowler manages to knock the bails from the stumps - the stumps are three sticks in the ground and the bails are two smaller sticks which balance on top of them . ) * LBW ( The ball hits the batsman on the leg , and the umpire decides that it * would * have knocked the bails from the stumps if he had n\'t got in the way ) * Hit Wicket ( The batsman goes full retard and knocks the bails off himself ) * Stumped / Run Out ( The batsman leaves his crease after facing a delivery and the fielding team manages to knock the bails off with the ball before he can get back behind it . The crease is a line 1 yard in front of the stumps . ) * Handled ball ( The batsman deliberately plays the ball with his hand , usually to stop it rolling on to the stumps ) . The batsman try to score as many \' runs \' as they can before they get out . A run is scored by the two batsmen ( there are always two on the pitch - one at each end ) running down the pitch and swapping ends before the fielding team can run either of them out . You can score as many runs as you want at a time - if you can run from one end to the other 150 times without the fielding team managing to knock the bails off , then you would score 150 runs ( although this would never happen ) . You can also score boundaries . If you hit the ball over a rope which marks the edge of the field , you score either 6 runs ( for clearing it without bouncing ) or 4 runs . The game is divided into \' overs \' . An over is a period of 6 balls bowled by the same bowler from the same end of the pitch . He bowls at whichever batsman happens to be standing at that end of the pitch at the time ( which can change from ball to ball if they score an odd number of runs from a shot ) . At the end of an over , another bowler takes over and bowls an over from the opposite end of the pitch . The difference between the forms of the game is : * Test Cricket - the classic form of the game . Each side has two batting innings , and whoever scores the most runs after all of the opponents have been given \' out \' in both innings wins . If 5 days passes without anybody having won ( remember - to win you have to bowl the opposing team out twice and score more runs than they did in total ) then the game is a draw . * Limited overs ( One Day ) cricket . This is where a result is forced by having each team play one innings of a set number of overs , and whoever has the most runs after both teams have batted wins . Simple as that . The two forms of limited over international cricket are ODIs , which are 50 overs per side , and T20 , which is 20 overs per side . In test cricket , the batsmen are much more cautious , because it \'s more important not to get out than it is to score quickly . In limited overs games , you simply have to score quickly to win , so it \'s much more acceptable to take risks and play shots which could get you out . The opposite is true for bowlers - in test matches , it is far more important for them to take wickets than anything else , so they can take risks with where the fielders stand and the types of delivery they bowl to make it more likely that if a batsmen makes a mistake you will get him out , but if he does n\'t there will be lots of gaps for him to hit the ball to and score runs .

The goal is to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of three sticks (called wickets) on opposite ends of a rectangular field. One team, the batting team, tries to score as many runs as possible by hitting the ball and running back and forth between the wickets. The other team, the fielding team, tries to get the batting team's players out and stop them from scoring runs. There are two main types of cricket matches: Test matches and shorter matches. Test matches are longer and played over a period of five days. Shorter matches, like One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) matches, are played in a single day or over a few days. In a Test match, each team gets two chances to bat, called innings. The team that scores the most runs in their two innings wins the match. In shorter matches, each team only gets one innings to score as many runs as possible. The team that scores the most runs wins the match. There are several ways that a player can be out in cricket. Some common ways are: Caught: If the fielding team catches the ball after the batsman hits it, the batsman is out. Bowled: If the ball hits the wicket while the batsman is trying to hit it, the batsman is out. Leg Before Wicket (LBW): If the ball hits the batsman's leg and would have hit the wicket if the leg wasn't there, the batsman is out. Run out: If the fielding team hits the wicket with the ball while the batsman is running between the wickets, the batsman is out. There are many more rules and details in cricket, but those are the basic ideas. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.""]",51.0,reddit_eli5,1658

Atoms Is there a certain amount of atoms ? Or are there somehow forming more atoms ?

What exactly happens during electrocution ? I know that electrocution is bad and everything but i never really understood why Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Good question ! First lets dive into what exactly electrical current is . For the purposes of this explanation , it 's the flow of any charged atomic particle , such as electrons , or ions in solution . Ions include things like Sodium , potassium , calcium and chloride . The cells in your body that are capable of ' firing ' such as neurons , and muscles , pay a lot of attention to these ions . As you may know , cells are mostly water , and have a membrane surrounding them , made up of fatty acids . Water with ions conducts electric current really well , fatty acids do not . You can think of your cells , as kind of being like a battery , in that they have high levels of potassium ( + ) and chloride ( - ) on the inside of the cell . They actively exclude Sodium ( + ) , and selectively allow calcium(++ ) inside . Cells like neurons , regulate the ratio of ions inside / outside , and they try to maintain electroneutrality . Phrased differently , the number of positive charges inside the cell , should equal the number of negative charges inside the cell . If you get electrocuted , suddenly there is a huge amount of negative charge ' outside ' the cells , going into the cells and that really messes up the whole system through some very complicated elecrophysics beyond this discussion . The other major source of more understandable and relatable death and horror , is through resistance . When electricity is flowing through an electrical wire , there is some measure of resistance in that wire . It is usually very low , but there is some mild resistance that becomes significant . If you 've ever touched an insulated electrical wire , or put your hand on an electrical transformer , you 'll notice that it is significantly warm . As electrical current encounters resistance , it generates heat ; just like moving a physical object generates friction ( heat ) , electrical movement generates electrical friction , ergo- heat . The amount of heat is a matter of how much resistance you have , and how much electricity you are trying to move . As an electrical conductor , you are n't that great , and you have a fair amount of resistance . If you have a lot of electricity you 're trying to move ... like say a downed power line , you are going to generate a very large amount of heat , extremely quickly ; and it will literally cook you . If you 're trying to move a much more reasonable amount of electricity , such as licking a nine volt battery , the heat is n't the aspect you notice . You notice your taste bud / pain neurons getting annoyed and telling you to stop . Does that help ?"", 'Your neurons use electricity to communicate . If you get shocked , your neurons might treat it as if a signal needed to be sent . So it triggers randomly . Your muscles might tense up in opposite directions , and injure it self . All the neurons firing in your brain is basically a seizure , so if your brain gets shocked all the neurons might fire . Also electricity that is strong enough might burn the things it passes through . This means it might burn the inside of your body .', 'Electrocution is death caused by electrical current flowing through the body . Electrical current is the movement of charge . So , we need to understand how the movement of charge through the body can kill a human . First , the human body has electrical resistance to the flow of current moving through it . When current flows through a resistor , heat is generated ( this is how heat is generated in an electric stove , or a hairdryer ) . A large enough current flowing through the body will cause substantial burns to the tissue through which the current flows . This in and of itself can kill a person , either directly , when large thermal damage is done to a major organ , like the heart or the brain , or indirectly , when the electrocuted person suffers thermal damage over a large enough portion of their body , resulting in infection and/or an electrolyte imbalance . Second , both muscles and nerves maintain a electrochemical gradient across their cell membranes . This electrochemical gradient is required for nerves to "" fire "" ( i.e. carry information along a nerve ) and for muscles to contract . Death can occur when current flows through / near the heart muscle , disrupting the electrochemical gradient required for normal heart function . The current then causes a heart attack(cessation of the heartbeat , or an irregular heart beat that impairs the ability of the heart to normally pump blood ) . Death can also occur if a large electrical current flows through the brain , causing massive disruption of the normal functioning of the brain , and seizures . A normally functioning brain is required to signal the diaphragm to contract , the mechanism for breathing . A large electrical current though the brain can cause a cessation of breathing , resulting in death by hypoxemia ( insufficient oxygen content in arterial blood ) .']","[""Electrocution is when a person is killed or severely injured by an electric shock. When a person is electrocuted, electricity flows through their body, causing damage to their tissues and organs. This can happen if a person touches a live wire or electrical outlet, or if they come into contact with electricity in some other way.Electricity is a type of energy that can move through materials that allow it to flow easily, like metal. When electricity flows through a person's body, it can cause the muscles to contract, which can make it difficult for the person to move or breathe. It can also cause the heart to stop beating, which can be deadly.Overall, electrocution is dangerous because it can cause serious injury or death by disrupting the normal functioning of the body's tissues and organs. It's important to be careful around electricity and to follow safety guidelines to avoid accidents.""]",,reddit_eli5,6933

Here are some important things to consider when looking for a place to live:\n\nRenting vs. buying: Renting a place means you are paying someone else to live in their property, while buying a place means you own it and can make changes to it as you see fit. Renting can be a good option if you are not ready to commit to buying a home or if you are not sure where you want to live long-term. Buying a home can be a good option if you have the financial means and are planning to stay in one place for a while.\n\nMortgages: If you decide to buy a home, you will likely need to get a mortgage, which is a loan from a bank or other financial institution that you use to pay for the home. To get a mortgage, you will need to provide information about your income, debts, and credit history, and you will need to make a down payment (a portion of the total cost of the home that you pay upfront).\n\nLeases: If you decide to rent a place, you will sign a lease, which is a legal agreement between you and the property owner or landlord. The lease will outline the terms of your tenancy, including the length of the rental period, the amount of rent you will pay, and any rules or restrictions that apply.\n\nApartments, townhouses, condos, and houses: There are many different types of properties you can rent or buy, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Apartments are typically smaller, multi-unit buildings with shared common areas. Townhouses are attached homes that share walls with neighboring units. Condos are similar to apartments, but you own your unit rather than renting it. Houses are standalone properties that you own.\n\nOther factors to consider: When looking for a place to live, you may also want to consider the location, the size of the property, the cost of living in the area, and any amenities or features that are important to you, such as a pool or a garage. You may also want to think about the commute to your job or school and whether you need to be near public transportation or other conveniences.']",,reddit_eli5,14894

Explain like I'm five.","[""In 70 A.D. the Roman empire destroyed Jerusalem which scattered the Jews that lived there and they eventually came to have small populations in most countries in Europe and Russia . The Jews lived without a country for nearly 2000 years . After WWII , they decided that they wanted to have a country again , so a bunch of Jews went back to live in Israel . The problem was that in the last 2000 years another group of people had come to live there . They called themselves the Palestinians . When the Jews asked for their land back , the Palestinians told them that it was no longer their land . In 1947 , Israel took back the land by force and forced the Palestinians out . in 1967 another war broke out ( it lasted six days ) and the Israelis gained even more land .

At its core, the conflict is about competing claims to land and sovereignty in the region known as Palestine, which includes the modern state of Israel and the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The conflict has its roots in the late 1800s, when Jewish immigrants began moving to Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire. These immigrants, known as Zionists, believed that Palestine was the ancient homeland of the Jewish people and that they had a right to live there. However, the region was already home to a large Arab population, which opposed the influx of Jewish immigrants and the establishment of a Jewish state. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, the League of Nations granted a mandate to Britain to administer Palestine. The British government encouraged Jewish immigration to Palestine, but also promised to protect the rights of the Arab population. In 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem being designated as an international city. The Jewish community accepted the plan, but the Arab states rejected it and launched a war against the newly established state of Israel. Since then, the conflict has continued, with numerous wars, negotiations, and peace agreements attempted to resolve the dispute. The main issues at stake are control of Jerusalem, the status of Palestinian refugees, the building of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, and the right of Palestinian self-determination. The conflict has also been fueled by religious and cultural differences, as well as political and economic interests. It has caused significant suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians, and has had a major impact on the region and the world.']",426.0,reddit_eli5,2033

This process is called bremsstrahlung, which means ""braking radiation"" in German. The X-rays produced by the generator are then directed towards the part of the body being examined, and they pass through the body and are captured on film or a digital detector on the other side. \nX-rays are used in many medical and industrial applications because they can pass through most materials and produce images of the inside of objects. They are particularly useful for examining bones, as they are absorbed by soft tissue but not by bone. This allows doctors to see the inside of the body and identify any problems or injuries.']",,reddit_eli5,554

If your solar panels weigh 30 kg , they 've negated their benefit , as they 're generating the same power that the car is spending to move them .

How does hydrogen turn into people ? I know you 've heard the quote -- I saw fourteen of you use it today . But how ? What 's the chain of events that begins with hydrogen and ends with people ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Stars are bright and hot because in their cores they have nuclear fusion going on . Nuclear Fusion is when small elements are crunched together ( fused ) to form larger elements . Depending on the star , different atoms will be combined to create different elements . Some stars convert hydrogen into helium . Other stars convert helium into relatively light elements ( like oxygen and carbon ) , and still other stars ( usually very large stars that are in the process of dying ) create heavier elements like gold and uranium . Some stars will explode when they die , spilling a chunk of their constructed elements out into the universe . These elements might form into other stars ( creating more heavy elements ) or they might form into planets . Now , what about your body ? Your body is made up of cells , which are made up of molecules , which are made up of elements . Since you * are n't * made up of entirely hydrogen , every element in your body must have at some point been formed by a star . So hydrogen turns into people , but in a kind of roundabout way . First hydrogen has to turn into helium ( in a star ) , then the helium has to turn into even heavier elements ( also in a star ) , then the heavier elements need to turn into a planet ( after the star explodes ) , then that planet has to produce life ( through abiogenesis(we're actually not quite sure how this specifically happened on earth ) ) , and then that life has to turn into people ( through evolution ) ."", 'It \'s a pretty terrible quote , frankly . But there are two important things you need to know about to understand this : baryogenesis and nucleosynthesis . Settle down , I \'m gon na explain them . You \'ve heard of protons , yeah ? Protons are one of the three particles that atoms are made of . Protons are particles called * baryons * ; a protons is one type of baryon . There \'s another type of baryon that \'s also important : It \'s called a neutron . There are about a * zillion * other types of baryons that * are n\'t * important to us right now , but take all of these things collectively and we call them baryons . Baryons are not elementary things . That is , they \'re things which are made of other things . What are they made of ? A variety of particles that are called * quarks . * The question , then , is how did quarks * initially * get together to make baryons ? Or in other words , how did the first baryons come to exist ? The answer is the Big Bang . The Big Bang was the earliest period in the history of the universe , lasting from * zero * — what we call the time of the very first event that ever happened — to about 400,000 years later . Early on in the Big Bang , the universe was very hot and dense , so hot and dense that no matter could exist . Later , as the universe cooled , the first quarks appeared . But it turns out quarks , by themselves , are not stable , for deep and complicated reasons we wo n\'t go into here . Below a certain energy density , quarks are only stable when they link up in pairs and in threes . So as the universe cooled , those first primordial quarks did just that : They hooked up in pairs and in threes . The pairs we call mesons and we do n\'t care about them right now ; the three - particle collections of quarks we call * baryons * , and the proton is the lightest of all the baryons . But when the quarks first congealed into baryons , the result was both baryons and * antibaryons * . You know , like antimatter ? When a baryon of one type encounters an antibaryon of another type , the two particles annihilate each other , meaning they cancel each other out and release photons . When a * heavy * baryon and a heavy antibaryon get together , they release * very energetic * photons . Very energetic photons do n\'t want to stay photons any more ; they want to decay into lighter particles . We call these lighter particles * leptons * . The electron , which you \'ve doubtless heard of , is a lepton . So let \'s review what we \'ve got so far : First the universe was very hot . As it cooled , quarks appeared . As it cooled further , quarks hooked up in pairs and triplets to form mesons and baryons and their antiparticles . But the mesons and baryons and their antiparticles all got together and mutually annihilated , releasing energetic photons which decayed into electrons . That \'s how both protons and electrons first came into existence . Of course , that raises the question : If all the baryons got together with all the antibaryons and annihilated to make photons and leptons … how come there are still baryons in the universe ? I mean , we \'re * surrounded * by atoms made of protons and neutrons , and those are baryons , so how \'d they get here ? The answer is called * baryon asymmetry * . See , way back when the free quarks first condensed into baryons and antibaryons , for every ten billion antibaryons that formed , ten billion * and one * baryons formed . So when all the annihilation happened , we had one baryon in ten billion left over with no partner to annihilate with . So those particles stayed around , and that \'s the origin of all the baryonic matter in the universe today . Why did that baryon asymmetry exist ? Nobody knows for sure . We already know about processes in nature that slightly favor baryons over antibaryons , so we know it \'s possible for that asymmetry to exist . But its precise nature is gon na remain a mystery for a while yet . Anyway , there we are , a bit after the start of the Big Bang . Quarks appeared , hooked up to make baryons , baryons annihilated releasing leptons and a * very slight * trace of leftover baryons . Meaning we had a universe that was filled with a hot gas of mostly protons and electrons and basically nothing else . As this gas cooled , the protons — which have positive electric charge — and the electrons — negative electric charge — got together . You know what you get when you put a proton and an electron together , do n\'t you ? You get * hydrogen . * That \'s how hydrogen came to exist : The universe cooled , and all those free protons and electrons hooked up . So the universe went from being filled with a hot electron - proton plasma to a merely warm ( a few thousand degrees ) neutral hydrogen gas . Well , this hydrogen gas was n\'t perfectly evenly distributed . It was denser in some places than in others . In places where it was denser , gravity started to pull the gas together to make it denser still . Once enough hydrogen gas gets together , a process called * nuclear fusion * can happen . Basically , if you squish two hydrogen nuclei — protons , in other words — together , they \'ll * stick * and make a helium nucleus . And if you stick two heliums together you get a beryllium , which is unstable and decays into a lithium … and so on . The trick is , none of these reactions can happen unless the hydrogen gas is really hot and really dense , which means you need a lot of it in one place . It took a few million years for this to happen , but once it did , you got * stars . * Stars are where * nucleosynthesis * happens . You start with hydrogen and smoosh the nuclei together to make bigger nuclei , then smoosh those nuclei together to make still bigger nuclei … then the star explodes . Because those first stars that existed did n\'t live very long . They were really inefficient , so once they got to a point where they could n\'t support themselves by fusing hydrogen into helium , they popped like balloons and scattered their contents through space . Which meant now you had this big clouds of hydrogen * and helium * , which again started to collapse under their own weight and turned into the next generation of stars . These fused the heavier stuff inside them into still heavier stuff , then popped and scattered their fusion products through space , products like carbon and nitrogen and oxygen . These subsequent clouds collapsed again and formed stars … but that \'s not all . Those clouds also congealed to form things smaller than stars , made up of heavier elements that had n\'t been present in the universe before , elements like iron and nickel and silicon , plus in at least one case a lot of leftover hydrogen that bonded with oxygen . We call these smaller things * planets * and the leftover - hydrogen - plus - oxygen * water * . And then one of those planets ended up having people on it . So yes , in a sense hydrogen turned into people , first through the process of baryogenesis — where hydrogen appeared for the first time in the universe — and then through nucleosynthesis — where hydrogen got smooshed together to make more interesting things inside the cores of about three generations of stars and about ten billion years . But just saying that "" hydrogen turns into people "" somehow manages to throw away all the * interesting * stuff and leave just one mundane , totally uninteresting fact that \'s sort - of true but not really .', ""Our sun is in it 's second life cycle , and is in the region of 4.5 billion years old . Before this , a much bigger star , made of 99.9 % hydrogen a little helium and a pinch of lithium ( all residue from the big bang , ) was floating around in space somewhere . This star had enough gravity in its core to fuse hydrogen in to larger heavier atoms like oxygen , carbon , iron and everything else that makes up the earth . Being so big , this star went into supernova . Basically it exploded , spewing all these heavy atoms out into nowhere . Thicker parts of this cloud of atoms started to gravitate towards each other , slowly clumping together , getting hotter and increasing its gravitational pull . As this clump grew in mass , it began the process of nuclear fusion again . The birth of a second , much smaller star from what was left of the first . Now , still spewed around this young star is all the thinner regions of the cloud of atoms . The gravity of the star , combined with centrifugal ( spinning ) force , began swirling the cloud into orbit around the star . The cloud , little by little , got thicker in places where all these atoms started clumping together . By centrifugal force and the even pull of gravity , these clumps were shaped into spheres , and became planets . Those closer to the sun are mostly made of dense iron - being heavier it was pulled closer by the new star - and those farther away are made from light , less dense gasses . In the earth 's case , a large body of molten iron was surrounded by a thin cover of mostly hydrogen and helium . As the earth began to cool , forming the crust , volcanoes were erupting intensely over the surface , spilling forth water vapour , carbon dioxide , methane and ammonia . A bit more cooling and bodies of water started to form , early oceans that were void of oxygen . The earth was in this state 3.5 - 4 billion years ago . Through electrical activity ( lightening ) , and the combining of early atmosphere gasses with the new oceans , and the odd atom of phosphorous that was kicking around , the first few basic building blocks of life were created . This pre - biotic soup , as it is known , consisted of a few amino acids and a couple of RNA bases . Add a few hundred million years , a few of these building blocks had formed into self - replicating molecules . A few of these molecules became bound together in an enclosed membrane , complete with instructions for copying itself , and life began . These very early bacteria - formed around 3 billion years ago - was the starting point for every living this on earth . Basic biological and biochemical processes were worked out . 2.7 - 2.2 billion years ago , the most important of biological process was worked out - photosynthesis . Suddenly , bacteria could create energy rich molecules using abundant CO2 and sunlight . But more importantly , they started mass producing oxygen . Oxygen changed everything . Much more energy was utilised when respiring with oxygen , and that meant life could replicate and diversify much much quicker . Bacteria started compartmentalizing regions of there cells , increasing efficiency . Some cells started collaborating , increasing survival , and some of these multi - celled organisms developed specialized regions , allowing them to out compete others . The rest came down to survival of the fittest , with the most diversified most likely to reproduce and pass on those characteristics . Add another billion years or so , and that led to you .""]","[""Hydrogen doesn't turn into people directly. However, hydrogen is an important part of the process that allows living things, including people, to exist. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and it is found in many different places, including the sun and other stars. The sun is a giant ball of gas that is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, and it gives off light and heat. This light and heat are what allow life to exist on Earth. On Earth, plants use the energy from the sun to turn carbon dioxide and water into food through a process called photosynthesis. When plants make food, they use the energy from the sun to combine hydrogen and oxygen atoms from water molecules to form glucose, which is a type of sugar. Glucose is a source of energy for plants, and it is also a source of energy for animals that eat plants. So, in a way, hydrogen is an important part of the process that allows living things, including people, to exist because it is used by plants to make food. When animals eat plants, they get the energy from the food that the plants made using hydrogen, and that energy is used to fuel their bodies and keep them alive.""]",638.0,reddit_eli5,2245

Customers tend to pick PCs based on things like price and performance ( including running the OS of choice ) . It is hard for customers to gauge things like reliability , so it tends not to be the prime factor in making a buying decision . PC makers want to keep warranty returns within an acceptable range without incurring a lot of extra engineering and manufacturing expense . And they want to emphasize the things that will get consumers to buy their machine . So as a result , they spend just enough on engineering to make it likely that the PC will last long enough . It \'s a business decision . This also has historically worked out for the industry because the ever increasing processing power of microelectronics has meant that after a few years , a PC is considered "" old "" and "" slow "" .

Some of those components, like the hard drive or the battery, can wear out over time with use. Others, like the processor or the memory, can become outdated as technology advances and newer, more powerful components become available. Because of these limitations, computers typically don't last forever. However, with proper care and maintenance, you can often extend the lifespan of your computer by keeping it clean, making sure it has adequate ventilation, and using it in a way that doesn't put too much strain on its components. It's also worth noting that the average lifespan of a computer can vary depending on the type of computer and how it's used.

Washington told him to talk to Jefferson , the secretary of state . Jefferson proffered that he 'd help Hamilton if Hamilton agreed to move the capital to somewhere near Virginia .

And yes , the absolutely can change , it \'s just not as common nowadays . For example , I \'ll take you through the history of Georgia \'s capitals ( since I live here ) . Savannah , on the coast , was the first city established in Georgia , and it was the de facto "" capital "" during the time when we were still a colony ( since we were technically governed by England , but the royal governor sat in Savannah ) . When we became a state , Savannah was named the state capital mostly because it always had been . As the state expanded , the population started shifting west and so Augusta , a little further up and west , was chosen as the next capital partially because it was nearer to the new center of the population and partially because it had served as a rotating capital with Savannah whenever the British were constantly laying siege to it during the Revolution . Augusta was the capital for a little bit before they moved it to Louisville , which did n\'t amount to much . In 1802 , governor John Milledge sent out a party to find the new geographic center of the state and there they would establish the new capital . The surveyors found a natural spring bubbling up close enough to the center , and so decided to establish Milledgeville as the new capital ( and eventually my home town :D ) . Milledgeville served as capital through the Civil War , until 1868 . During Reconstruction , the military governor of Georgia ordered new delegates to meet in Atlanta . Atlanta became the official capital for a few reasons . First , it was a rebirth from being burned down by General Sherman ( even open - minded , progressive liberals in Georgia gag at the mention of his name ) , and it gave Georgia a new start away from its Confederate capital . Also , Milledgeville is surrounded by hills , which made it hard as hell for trains to get in . Atlanta , on the other hand , is relatively flat and actually began life as a train hub called Terminus . It also was a bigger , more modern city on the rise .

TL;DR : It \'s the legislature deciding where to put the capital , and they can change relatively simply . They just do n\'t tend to anymore .', 'There \'s a whole load of explanations for why a city ends up being the capital of a country . It \'s not necessarily because it was explicitly chosen . For example the Roman empire started out as a the city state of Rome . So naturally Rome was the capital of the empire .

A lot of old countries do n\'t have a process for choosing a capital city , because it has "" always "" been where it is .

It is often chosen to be in a central location within the state, province, or country, so that it is easily accessible to all parts of the region. \nSometimes, the capital city is chosen because it is already an important economic or cultural center. For example, London is the capital of the United Kingdom because it is a major financial and cultural center. \nIn some cases, the capital city may be changed by the government.

The bad : The same protections that keep good workers from being fired unjustly , also sadly can help a bad worker stay on because it \'s more difficult to get rid of them , and there \'s a process that must be strictly followed to make it happen .

Feel free to ask if you want to know anything else specific .', 'The only issue I have ever had with the Union is when I worked for a Memory ( RAM ) company based out of San Jose in the mid 90 \'s . When negotiations started for the new contract the union demanded Pay raises across the board based on the fact that the company had increased its profits every year for the last three years . The CEO combated that with "" If we lose money for the next three years are you going to demand a pay cut across the board ? "" Of course there was dead silence . In the end they agreed to a pay increase that was about 10 % more than then the cost of living increase . About 2 years later the internet bubble burst and sales dropped by 60 % in a three month time span . I got the hell out and went into the healthcare industry . When the time came to renegotiate the Union again asked for a cost of living increase , the CFO opened the books and showed them it was impossible , they had the numbers in their hands and still demanded it . The company was closed , everyone out of work . A few years ago I ran into the old CEO at a trade show , he drunkenly confessed that it was a more profitable move to close the company and sale the customer list and walk away . He was originally the one that brought the union in . I never personally had to deal with the union directly , but I did have to deal with poor employee \'s that continued to work there because the union protected them . I am not saying this behavior is normal or on par with all unions , but it was the experience I had and it has left a bad taste in my mouth 10 + years later . I work in Health care now as an engineer , I work with several union employees that are rock stars at what they do , but I still have a bit of prejudiced against them because they are union . Maybe I will never get over it . Maybe I am in a different place , but it has been my experience that the more money I help the company make , the more money and free time they are willing to give me , I do n\'t need to threaten to strike if I do n\'t get a raise , Ill just leave if they do n\'t give me one . I would sooner die than allow someone to negotiate my pay for me , and I would personally be humiliated if my boss wanted me out but could not fire me because some lawyer was protecting me . Again maybe I am just fortunate in my life and do n\'t understand the plights of some . I wo nt say I am against the Labor Unions , but I do have some trust issues with them . Sorry OP the best I can do is offer you my experiences , I really ca nt answer as to why there is so much negativity towards the unions in the states .']","[""Labor unions are organizations that represent workers and negotiate with employers on issues such as wages, benefits, and working conditions. While some people view labor unions positively because they can help improve the lives of workers, others view them negatively for various reasons.\n\nOne reason some people view labor unions negatively is because they may believe that unions have too much power and influence. For example, if a union goes on strike (stops working to protest an issue), it can disrupt the operations of a company and negatively impact the company's customers and profits. This can cause tensions between unions and management.\n\nAnother reason some people view labor unions negatively is because they may believe that unions are too expensive or that they require workers to pay union dues, which can be a burden for some workers.\n\nIt's also possible that some people view labor unions negatively because they may have had a negative personal experience with a union, or because they have heard negative things about unions from others.\n\nOverall, it's important to understand that labor unions can be both positive and negative, and that different people may have different opinions about them. It's also important to remember that unions exist to advocate for the rights and interests of workers, and that they can be a valuable resource for workers who want to improve their working conditions and advocate for fair treatment on the job.""]",,reddit_eli5,16969

How AI technology works in first / third person shooter videogames ? How do AI characters react to your moves in shooter videogames ? Also how do difficulty levels work for AI ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Valve has published a [ slide deck ( PDF ) ] ( URL_0 ) on how they designed the AI for Left 4 Dead . It \'s a bit more on the technical side if that \'s what you \'re interested in . Difficulty levels are just based on how fast the AI reacts and how much error you allow it to have . It \'s really easy to make the "" perfect "" AI because the computer always knows exactly where you are . So to make the game playable , you have to make the AI more stupid- it has to have some random error in its shots and you have to simulate some form of "" vision "" and reaction time or else the bad guys will just snipe you with a hitscan weapon from across the map as soon as the game starts . For a more difficult game , you just turn down the stupid factor .', ""Disclaimer : not an A.I. programmer , but this is my understanding of how you can go about it . There may be better ways to script an A.I. Typically you are programming a series of ' If this Then that ' statements . There can be levels of complexity in how this is done , but it can be generalized somewhat to ' If- > Then ' . For example , lets assume that we have a PlayerChar object that can return its location . We can check if it is in range , aim at it , and fire at that location IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { aimAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; fireAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; } would check if the Player 's Character is within the AI characters ' range ' , ' aim ' at that location , and ' fire ' at that location . You might also program the A.I. to look for cover . Lets assume we have an array that stores nearby objects that are ' cover ' , and can choose randomly from that array to decide where to hide before moving to that location IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { coverArray = searchForCover(me.location ) ; cover = pickRandom(coverArray ) ; moveToLocation(cover.location ) ; IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { aimAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; fireAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; } } Using logical steps in that manner , we could program a very basic enemy A.I. that checks for an enemy in range , looks for cover , moves to cover , and begins to aim and fire at the player . Depending on the complexity of the A.I. these logical steps can get very , very complicated , and have a lot of checks and special logic , e.g A.I. can only detect in a particular cone of view , they can detect sound , vision , they can react to alarms and move to that location , so on and so forth . With difficulty levels , what you might adjust is how well the A.I. reacts . Maybe they have better range , a wider cone of vision , maybe they pick better cover , or are more ' intelligent ' with how they react to your presence . For example , at a lower difficulty , I might allow the A.I. to have more of a delay before searching for cover . But at a higher difficulty , not only will they always run for cover , but they will coordinate with nearby A.I. to lay down alternating fire to keep your character suppressed . With programming an A.I , you usually already have the code for how the ' player ' character works . You now are designing code to do all the things a ' player ' character can do , but automatically based on known inputs ( e.g. the player moves into range , an alarm goes off , an event script tells the A.I. where to go , etc . )"", ""There is really no single answer to this question : shooter video games are not all exactly alike , and even small changes in the game ( available weapon choices , player abilities , common features and motifs in maps ) could require somewhat different behavior from the AI in order to make sense . For example , a shooter with many splash damage weapons would require effective AI to actively try to avoid standing too close to other AI bots , while this would not be a factor in shooters that mostly involve high accuracy , slow firing weapons . Now , this is a gross simplification ( especially since I have limited knowledge of Artificial Intelligence techniques and no knowledge of game - oriented AI ) but a reasonable model for the AI could be a classical State - based representation of the world . State - based representation means that at any given point in time , the algorithm ruling the bot will consider all sorts of various factors ( distance from player , line of sight , player 's equipped weapon , map topography etc ) and use some pre - defined function in order to evaluate the Value of that state ( the higher the value , the more likely the bot will want to be in that state ) . The bot will then evaluate some ( or all ) of its available moves , create many estimates for the possible states that will be created as a result ( and estimate the probability of each hypothetical state ) , and then use another computation ( such as the average state value , or the maximal minimum if the AI wants to minimize risk to itself ) in order to finally select what move to perform . This action is repeated between every two moves the bot performs . It 's not always a very hard computation -- mostly it depends on how many moves deep the algorithm will consider . Having such a system in place , it is possible to tweak the AI 's difficulty level by introducing errors , limiting the amount of moves considered , limiting options at specific instances or even explicitly forcing the algorithm to make sub - optimal choices , say , 5 % of the time . Naturally many , many other types of AIs exist . What I covered is really just a tip of the iceberg .""]","['In a first/third person shooter video game, the AI characters are computer-controlled characters that move and act in the game.

For example, some people have brown eyes and some people have blue eyes. If a mom and a dad with brown eyes have a baby, the baby might have brown eyes too.

Maybe the baby will have a new trait that no one in its family has ever had before. This can happen because of something called a mutation, which is a change in the genes that control how a living thing looks and acts. Mutations can be small, like a change in the color of a flower, or big, like a change in the shape of a beak.\r\n\r\nOver time, living things with traits that help them survive and have babies will have more babies than living things with traits that don't help them survive. This is because the living things with helpful traits are more likely to survive and pass their traits down to their babies.\r\n\r\nSo, over many, many years, the traits of a group of living things can change.

What is a computer ' memory leak ' ? I see it 's a huge issue with PC software but have no clue what it means . Can someone kindly explain it to me in simple terms please Explain like I'm five. ,"['Modern operating systems let you run multiple programs at once , but you only have one pool of RAM that they all have to share . The way that works is that when a program wants memory , it asks the operating system for however much it needs , and the OS finds a block that \'s not being used and loans it to the program . When the program is done using the memory , it \'s supposed to return it so other programs can use it . A memory leak happens when a program forgets about a block of memory the operating system gave it . As far as the operating system is concerned , it still has that block "" checked out "" , but the program ca n\'t do anything with it , and it ca n\'t return it back to the operating system because it ca n\'t find it . The memory is n\'t gone permanently- when the program exits , the operating system knows it does n\'t need the memory any more so it marks all the memory that was checked out by the program as "" available "" again . But it \'s not going to be available as long as that program is still running . It \'s only a big problem if the program keeps doing this . If it keeps hitting the code where it asks for more memory , but never returns any of it . Since it \'s not giving any memory back , the program will , over time , consume more and more of your computer \'s memory until you do n\'t have any more memory to give it . At that point , the computer has three choices : 1 . It can start rejecting requests from programs that ask for more memory ( which generally results in those programs crashing ) 2 . It can try storing additional data on the hard drive , which keeps the computer running but is something like 1000x slower than RAM so your computer will slow to a crawl 3 . It can try to figure out which program is stealing all of the memory and terminate that one ( Linux does this , Mac and Windows do n\'t since some programs do n\'t deal well with not having time to clean up ) EDIT : formatting', ""Software developer here , Memory is a finite resource , your computer has only so much of it . Every program needs memory , and it 's use has to be coordinated to ensure no two programs overwrite each other . That coordination typically happens through the OS as the mediator between all other programs and memory . Every program keeps track of what memory addresses it 's using . Typically , when a program needs memory , it will request what it needs , and when it 's done with that memory , it will release it back into the pool of available memory . Most programs , it 's the responsibility of the programmer to allocate and free the memory . Oversights are common , and an algorithm may allocate memory without releasing it when finished . The OS does n't know the program is done with that memory , it does n't know there 's an error that is allocating without releasing memory , and the program error may be such that the program loses track of which bytes it no longer needs , and now it ca n't release it back to the OS . This is a memory leak . The pool of memory is slowly draining . This can bog down your system until the offending process is killed and the allocated memory can be reclaimed , if other processes do n't themselves start failing ."", 'I think the best ELI5 would be to equate a computer as a teacher , and computer programs as little students .

"Please explain what is ""Symbolic AI""","['In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. \nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel\'s Checker\'s Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant\'s PAC learning, Quinlan\'s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]\nNeural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt\'s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn\'t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]']","['Symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and logic-based methods to solve problems. It is also sometimes referred to as ""classical AI"" or ""good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI).""\n\n\n\nIn symbolic AI, problems are solved by manipulating symbols according to a set of rules. The symbols represent concepts or entities in the problem domain, and the rules represent the relationships between those concepts or entities. For example, a symbolic AI system might be designed to solve a puzzle by representing the different pieces of the puzzle as symbols and using rules to manipulate those symbols and find a solution.\n\n\n\nSymbolic AI systems are often based on first-order logic, which allows them to represent and reason about the properties of objects and the relationships between them. This makes them well-suited for tasks that require logical reasoning and problem-solving, such as natural language processing, planning, and theorem proving.\n\n\n\nHowever, symbolic AI systems have some limitations. They can be difficult to design and implement, and they may require a large amount of human-generated knowledge to be encoded into the system. In addition, they can be inflexible and may not be able to handle uncertainty or handle tasks that require a lot of data or sensory input.\n\n\n\nToday, symbolic AI is often used in combination with other AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, in order to improve their performance and overcome some of their limitations.']",,wiki_csai,18317

The computer would then run a simulation of the brain\'s information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a sentient conscious mind.\nSubstantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain–computer interfaces, connectomics, and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains.  According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but say they are still in the realm of engineering possibility.\nMind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: copy-and-upload or copy-and-delete by gradual replacement of neurons (which can be considered as a gradual destructive uploading), until the original organic brain no longer exists and a computer program emulating the brain takes control over the body. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by storing and copying, that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process or may be deliberately destroyed during it in some variants of uploading. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in a computer inside (or either connected to or remotely controlled) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological or cybernetic body.\nAmong some futurists and within the part of transhumanist movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension or immortality technology (known as ""digital immortality""). Some believe mind uploading is humanity\'s current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to cryonics. Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our ""mind-file"", to enable interstellar space travel, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a computing device. Whole-brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a ""logical endpoint"" of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI (artificial general intelligence) and to at least weak superintelligence. Another approach is seed AI, which would not be based on existing brains. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a technological singularity, meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology. Mind uploading is a central conceptual feature of numerous science fiction novels, films, and games.']","[""Whole brain emulation, also known as mind uploading or brain uploading, is the hypothetical process of transferring the information from a biological brain to a computer-based system or device, with the goal of achieving artificial intelligence or creating a virtual copy of an individual's consciousness.

As its name indicates, the PRAM is intended as the parallel-computing analogy to the random-access machine (RAM) (not to be confused with random-access memory). In the same way that the RAM is used by sequential-algorithm designers to model algorithmic performance (such as time complexity), the PRAM is used by parallel-algorithm designers to model parallel algorithmic performance (such as time complexity, where the number of processors assumed is typically also stated). Similar to the way in which the RAM model neglects practical issues, such as access time to cache memory versus main memory, the PRAM model neglects such issues as synchronization and communication, but provides any (problem-size-dependent) number of processors. Algorithm cost, for instance, is estimated using two parameters O(time) and O(time × processor_number).']","['A parallel random-access machine (PRAM) is an abstract model of a computer that can perform multiple operations simultaneously.

His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had ""an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960."" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.\nFodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation.[citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.\nFor Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or ""organs"", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the ""central processing"" part of the mind, which has a more global and less ""domain specific"" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.:\u200a73–75\u200a\nAlthough Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.']","['Jerry Fodor was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist.

In other words, a random field is said to be a Markov random field if it satisfies Markov properties. The concept originates from the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model.\nA Markov network or MRF is similar to a Bayesian network in its representation of dependencies; the differences being that Bayesian networks are directed and acyclic, whereas Markov networks are undirected and may be cyclic. Thus, a Markov network can represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network cannot (such as cyclic dependencies[further explanation needed]); on the other hand, it can't represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network can (such as induced dependencies[further explanation needed]). The underlying graph of a Markov random field may be finite or infinite.\nWhen the joint probability density of the random variables is strictly positive, it is also referred to as a Gibbs random field, because, according to the Hammersley–Clifford theorem, it can then be represented by a Gibbs measure for an appropriate (locally defined) energy function. The prototypical Markov random field is the Ising model; indeed, the Markov random field was introduced as the general setting for the Ising model.

"Please explain what is ""Computational complexity""","['In computer science, the computational complexity or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it. Particular focus is given to computation time (generally measured by the number of needed elementary operations) and memory storage requirements. The complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow solving the problem.\nThe study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called analysis of algorithms, while the study of the complexity of problems is called computational complexity theory. Both areas are highly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound on the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm. Moreover, for designing efficient algorithms, it is often fundamental to compare the complexity of a specific algorithm to the complexity of the problem to be solved. Also, in most cases, the only thing that is known about the complexity of a problem is that it is lower than the complexity of the most efficient known algorithms. Therefore, there is a large overlap between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. \nAs the amount of resources required to run an algorithm generally varies with the size of the input, the complexity is typically expressed as a function n → f(n), where n is the size of the input and f(n) is either the worst-case complexity (the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed over all inputs of size n) or the average-case complexity (the average of the amount of resources over all inputs of size n). Time complexity is generally expressed as the number of required elementary operations on an input of size n, where elementary operations are assumed to take a constant amount of time on a given computer and change only by a constant factor when run on a different computer.

The term ""intellectual property"" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world\'s legal systems.\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to benefit from the information and intellectual goods they create, and allows them to protect their ideas and prevent copying. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.[10]\nThe intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is ""indivisible"", since an unlimited number of people can ""consume"" an intellectual good without its being depleted.[11][page\xa0needed] Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: Landowners can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but producers of information or literature can usually do little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price.

Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.\nQuantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization); objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality); and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).\nQuantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations which could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck\'s solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein\'s 1905 paper which explained the photoelectric effect. These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the ""old quantum theory"", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Paul Dirac and others.

"Please explain what is ""Natural selection""","['Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations. Charles Darwin popularised the term ""natural selection"", contrasting it with artificial selection, which in his view is intentional, whereas natural selection is not.\nVariation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and their offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Because individuals with certain variants of the trait tend to survive and reproduce more than individuals with other less successful variants, the population evolves. Other factors affecting reproductive success include sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.\nNatural selection acts on the phenotype, the characteristics of the organism which actually interact with the environment, but the genetic\n(heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives that phenotype a reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation  (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.\nNatural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin\'s influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin\'s writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.']","[""Natural selection is a process that occurs in nature as a result of certain inherited traits being more or less advantageous for an individual's survival and reproduction in a particular environment. These advantageous traits tend to be passed on to future generations, while disadvantageous traits tend to be selected against and are less likely to be passed on. This process ultimately leads to the evolution of species over time.\n\n\n\nThe theory of natural selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century, and it remains one of the most important concepts in the field of biology. According to the theory, natural selection occurs because individuals within a population vary in their traits, and some of these traits are more advantageous than others in a particular environment. For example, a population of gazelles that live in a grassland habitat may have individuals with longer legs, which allow them to run faster and escape from predators more effectively. These individuals would be more likely to survive and reproduce, and as a result, the trait of long legs would be more common in the population over time.\n\n\n\nNatural selection is one of the main mechanisms of evolution, and it has shaped the diversity of life on Earth as we know it today.""]",,wiki_csai,18796

Good\'s intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.\nThe first person to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\nThe concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to ""the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole"", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\'s 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction.[10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\nProminent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.[12] One claim made was that the artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.']","['The technological singularity is a hypothetical future event that is associated with the creation of superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI).

Convolutional neural networks, in the context of computer vision, can be seen as a GNN applied to graphs structured as grids of pixels. Transformers, in the context of natural language processing, can be seen as GNNs applied to complete graphs whose nodes are words in a sentence.\nThe key design element of GNNs is the use of pairwise message passing, such that graph nodes iteratively update their representations by exchanging information with their neighbors.

However, while problems associated with ""mixture distributions"" relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations, ""mixture models"" are used to make statistical inferences about the properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled population, without sub-population identity information.\nMixture models should not be confused with models for compositional data, i.e., data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value (1, 100%, etc.). However, compositional models can be thought of as mixture models, where members of the population are sampled at random. Conversely, mixture models can be thought of as compositional models, where the total size reading population has been normalized to 1.']","['A mixture model is a probabilistic model that represents a combination of multiple probability distributions. It is a flexible tool for modeling data that can be represented as a mixture of different underlying distributions.\n\n\n\nIn a mixture model, the data is assumed to be generated by a mixture of different probability distributions, rather than a single distribution. Each of these distributions is referred to as a component of the mixture model. The mixture model assigns a weight to each component, indicating the probability that a data point was generated by that component. The weights sum to 1, and they represent the probability that a data point was generated by each of the components.\n\n\n\nMixture models are commonly used in a variety of applications, including density estimation, clustering, and classification. They are particularly useful when the data exhibits complex structure or when it is not clear which probability distribution best describes the data.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a set of data points that represent the heights of individuals in a population. It is possible that the heights of the individuals in this population are distributed according to a normal distribution, but it is also possible that the distribution is more complex, with multiple modes or outliers.

It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.\nSome speech recognition systems require ""training"" (also called ""enrollment"") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person\'s specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person\'s speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called ""speaker-independent"" systems. Systems that use training are called ""speaker dependent"".\nSpeech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. ""call home""), call routing (e.g. ""I would like to make a collect call""), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).\nThe term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person\'s voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.\nFrom the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations.

"Please explain what is ""Approximate computing""","['Approximate computing is an emerging paradigm for energy-efficient and/or high-performance design. It includes a plethora of computation techniques that return a possibly inaccurate result rather than a guaranteed accurate result, and that can be used for applications where an approximate result is sufficient for its purpose. One example of such situation is for a search engine where no exact answer may exist for a certain search query and hence, many answers may be acceptable. Similarly, occasional dropping of some frames in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing bounded approximation can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy.[clarification needed]  For example, in k-means clustering algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification.\nThe key requirement in approximate computing is that approximation can be introduced only in non-critical data, since approximating critical data (e.g., control operations) can lead to disastrous consequences, such as program crash or erroneous output.']","['Approximate computing is a computing paradigm that involves intentionally introducing errors or uncertainty into computing systems in order to reduce resource consumption or improve performance.

Jack doesn't compensate himself for the equity sale, as he didn't sell anything.  The company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion.  In the long term, the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $200,000 no-interest loan to the company.   If the value of the company before investing $250,000 is $1 million, then the value after investing is $1.25 million.  So $250,000 is 20% of the value of the company.  BigCo should not give the buyer 25% of BigCo but only 20% in that example.  If it does give 25%, the buyer is getting a $312,500 stake for only $250,000.   With the other example, Jack sells 25% of the company for $250,000 from his personal shares.  This doesn't change the assessed value of the company, just Jack's stake.

If the check is written to BigCo, then one or more of those numbers is incorrect.   The buyer could be getting a 20% stake.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1.25 million.

An interest-only mortgage is a type of home loan in which the borrower only pays the interest on the loan each month, rather than paying both the principal and the interest. This means that the borrower does not make any progress on paying off the loan balance during the interest-only period.There are a few potential advantages to an interest-only mortgage. For example, the monthly payments may be lower during the interest-only period, which can be helpful for borrowers who are on a tight budget. Additionally, an interest-only mortgage can be a good option for borrowers who expect their income to increase significantly in the future, as they will be able to pay off the loan more quickly once the interest-only period ends.However, there are also a number of potential drawbacks to an interest-only mortgage. One of the biggest risks is that the borrower may end up paying more in the long run, as they will eventually have to start paying off the principal of the loan in addition to the interest. Additionally, if the value of the property decreases, the borrower may owe more on the loan than the property is worth. This could make it difficult to sell the property or refinance the loan.Overall, it is important for borrowers to carefully consider their financial situation and goals before deciding whether an interest-only mortgage is the right choice for them.

But if I had bought a house, my mother would have lent me the money, with me paying it back to her over the years on 3% interest. So it would have been some kind of a private loan. But my mom would never have taken ownership of the house, since it was not her intention to own it in any way. (Does your dad intend to own the house and rent it to you? If yes, and if you are comfortable with renting instead of buying, then this is an option.) The second option, the one we discarded because of the additional cost, is that I could have taken a loan, paying 4.5% interest to the bank, which would then pay under 1% to my mom, and keep the rest. Banks always want to make profit, and this profit has to come from somewhere - from the difference between the interest rates. If your dad has 230k on the bank, and you owe 230k to the bank, you are better off if you keep the bank out - at least as long as your dad is comfortable with lending you money, and you are comfortable with owing him money. (my gf would never borough money from her mother, because her mother would always play the ""you are in my debt"" card - on each and every visit, and whenever she needed help in any way...) So the key is: What does your dad feel comfy with - and what do you feel comfy with. If possible, keep the banks out, but set up a written contract between you and your dad.']","[""There are a few options you can consider if you want to buy a home that is being paid for in cash by your father. Here are a few options to consider:Purchase the home through a mortgage: One option is to take out a mortgage on the property and pay your father the purchase price in installments. This can be a good option if you have good credit and can qualify for a mortgage with a favorable interest rate.Use a land contract: Another option is to use a land contract, also known as a contract for deed. With a land contract, you would make payments to your father over time, and he would hold the title to the property until the final payment is made. Once the final payment is made, the title would be transferred to you.Use a promissory note: You could also use a promissory note to document the terms of the sale. A promissory note is a written promise to pay a certain amount of money at a specific time or on demand. You could use a promissory note to outline the terms of the sale, including the purchase price, the payment schedule, and any late payment fees.Regardless of which option you choose, it is important to have a written agreement in place to document the terms of the sale and protect both you and your father's interests. It may also be a good idea to consult with an attorney to ensure that the agreement is legally enforceable.""]",,finance,19747
Can I rely on my home equity to finance large home repairs?,"['Yes, a HELOC is great for that. I just had my roof done last month (~$15K, ""ugh"") and pretty much every major contractor in my area had a 0% same-as-cash for at least 12 months.

Home equity is the value of your home minus any outstanding mortgage debt. If you have built up a significant amount of equity in your home, you may be able to borrow against it using a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC).A home equity loan is a type of loan that allows you to borrow a lump sum of money using your home as collateral. The loan is typically paid back over a fixed period of time, with equal monthly payments that include both principal and interest.A HELOC is a type of loan that allows you to borrow against your home equity as needed. With a HELOC, you are approved for a certain amount of credit, and you can borrow against that credit as needed, up to the credit limit. You are only required to make payments on the amount that you borrow, and you can borrow and repay the funds as needed over the life of the loan.Both home equity loans and HELOCs can be used to finance large home repairs, such as replacing a roof or updating a kitchen. It's important to carefully consider the terms of any loan or credit product before borrowing, and to make sure that you will be able to afford the monthly payments.""]",,finance,20405
Why there's always a very huge volume of trades for AAPL every day before market close?,"['A huge amount of money in all financial markets is from institutional investors, such as mutual funds, government pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, etc.  For various reasons these funds do all of their trading at the end of the day.  They care primarily that their end-of-day balances are in line with their targets and are easy to audit and far less about ""timing the market"" for the best possible trades. So, if you\'re looking at a stock that is owned by many institutional investors -- such as a stock (like AAPL) that makes up a significant portion of an index that many funds track -- there will be a huge amount of activity at this time relative to stocks that are less popular among institutions. Even just in its introduction this paper (PDF) gives a fair overview of other reasons why there\'s a lot of trading at end-of-day in general. (In fact, because of all this closing activity and the reliance on end-of-day prices as signposts for financial calculations, the end-of-day has for decades been the single most fraud-ridden time of the trading day.  Electronic trading has done away with a lot of the straight-up thievery that floor traders and brokers used to get away with at the expense of the public, but it still exists.  See, for example, any explanation of the term banging the close, or the penalties against 6 banks just last month for manipulating the FX market at the close.)']","['There are several reasons why there may be a large volume of trades for a particular stock, such as Apple (AAPL), at the end of the trading day. One reason may be that traders and investors are trying to close out their positions before the market closes for the day. This can be especially true if the market has been volatile or if there are concerns about potential market-moving news or events that may occur after the market closes. Additionally, the end of the trading day is often when mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional investors reconcile their positions and make any necessary trades to align their portfolios with their investment strategies. This can also contribute to increased trading volume at the end of the day. Finally, it is also common for traders and investors to engage in what is known as ""end-of-day"" trading, which involves buying or selling a stock at the close of the market in order to benefit from any changes in the stock\'s price that may occur after the market closes.', ""There are a number of possible reasons why there may be a large volume of trades for a particular stock, such as Apple (AAPL), at the close of the market.

For example, if a company is set to report earnings after the market closes and there is expected to be a significant impact on the stock's price, traders may want to adjust their positions before the earnings announcement.Another reason for increased trading volume at the close of the market could be related to the way that certain investment strategies are implemented. For example, some investment strategies may involve buying or selling a large volume of a particular stock at the close of the market in order to take advantage of price movements that may occur overnight or over the weekend.Finally, it is also possible that the increased volume of trades at the close of the market could be related to the overall level of market activity at that time. As the market approaches the close of trading, there may be more traders and investors looking to adjust their positions or to close out their trades for the day, which could result in increased trading volume.""]",,finance,20586
New business owner - How do taxes work for the business vs individual?,"[""Through your question and then clarification through the comments, it looks like you have a U.S. LLC with at least two members.  If you did not elect some other tax treatment, your LLC will be treated as a partnership by the IRS.  The partnership should file a tax return on Form 1065.  Then each partner will get a Schedule K-1 from the partnership, which the partner should use to include their respective shares of the partnership income and expenses on their personal Forms 1040. You can also elect to be taxed as an S-Corp or a C-Corp instead of a partnership, but that requires you to file a form explicitly making such election.  If you go S-Corp, then you will file a different form for the company, but the procedure is roughly the same - Income gets passed through to the owners via a Schedule K-1.  If you go C-Corp, then the owners will pay no tax on their own Form 1040, but the C-Corp itself will pay income tax. As far as whether you should try to spend the money as business expense to avoid paying extra tax - That's highly dependent on your specific situation.

How do credit union loans and dividends vs interest work?,"['A credit Union makes loans exactly the same ways a bank does. A portion of the money deposited in  checking, savings, money market, Certificate of Deposit, or IRA is then used to make loans for cars, boats, school, mortgages, 2nd mortgages, lines of credit...

When you make a loan payment, the credit union uses that money to pay back the other members who have deposited money in the credit union. This is why credit unions are able to offer lower rates on loans.A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a credit union's profits to its members. Credit unions are non-profit organizations, so any profits they make are returned to their members in the form of dividends on savings accounts and other types of accounts.

Travel expenses for an out-of-state rental,"['While the question is very localized, I\'ll answer about the general principle. My main question is with how far away it is (over 1000 miles), how do   I quantify the travel expenses? Generally, ""necessary and ordinary"" expenses are deductible. This is true for business and also true for rentals. But what is necessary and what is ordinary? Is it ordinary that a landlord will manage the property 1000 miles away by himself on a daily basis? Is it ordinary for people to drive 1000 miles every week? I\'d say ""no"" to both. I\'d say it would be cheaper for you to hire a local property manager, thus the travel expense would not be necessary. I would say it would be cheaper to fly (although I don\'t know if its true to the specific situation of the OP, but as I said - its too localized to deal with) rather than drive from Texas to Colorado. If the OP thinks that driving a thousand miles is indeed ordinary and necessary he\'ll have to justify it to the IRS examiner, as I\'m sure it will be examined. 2 trips to the property a year will be a nearly 100% write-off (2000   miles, hotels, etc). From what I understood (and that is what I\'ve been told by my CPA), IRS generally allows 1 (one) trip per year per property. If there\'s an exceptional situation - be prepared to justify it. Also, keep all the receipts (like gas, hotel, etc.... If you claim mileage but in reality you took a flight - you\'ll get hit hard by the IRS when audited). Also while I\'m up there am I allowed to mix business with pleasure? You cannot deduct personal (""pleasure"") expenses, at all. If the trip is mainly business, but you go out at the evening instead of staying at the hotel - that\'s fine. But if the trip is ""business"" trip where you spend a couple of hours at your property and then go around having fun for two days - the whole trip may be disallowed. If there\'s a reasonable portion dedicated to your business/rental, and the rest is pleasure - you\'ll have to split some of the costs and only deduct the portion attributed to the business activities. You\'ll have to analyze your specific situation, and see where it falls. Don\'t stretch the limits too much, it will cost you more on the long run after all the audits and penalties. Can I also write off all travel involved in the purchase of the   property? Although, again, the ""necessary and ordinary"" justification of such a trip is arguable, lets assume it is necessary and ordinary and generally justified. It is reasonable to expect you to go and see the property with your own eyes before the closing (IMHO, of course, I\'m not an authority). Such an expense can be either business or investment expense. If its a business expense - its deductible on schedule C. If its an investment expense (if you do buy the property), its added to the cost of the property (capitalized).

Why was S&P 500 PE Ratio so high on May 2009,"['Asking why the p/e was so high is best answered ""because reported earnings were so low"". Recall that the S&P500 bottomed in early March 2009 when the panic of the financial crisis reached exhaustion.  As noted on the page you have linked, the reported p/e ratios are computed using reported earnings from the trailing twelve months.  During those twelve months the banks were writing down all of the bad debt associated with the mortgage backed securities that has lost so much value.  This meant that the banks were reporting negative earnings.  Since the financial sector is a large part of the S&P500, this alone had an enormous effect on the index p/e.  However, the problem was compounded by a general collapse in earnings across the economy as consumers reacted to the resulting uncertainty.  The same site reports earnings for the previous years at $17.11 for the S&P500, compared to $76.17 for the year prior to 2008.  That is a collapse of about 78% in earnings.  Although the S&P500 has suffered badly during this time, stock market investors being forward looking were starting to price in improved earnings by May 2009.  Indeed, the S&P500 was up about 33% in just two months, from its low in March2009 to mid May2009.  Thus, by May of 2009 prices were not suffering to the same extent as reported trailing earnings.  This would account for the anomalous p/e value reporting in May2009.']","[""The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is a measure of how expensive a stock or market index is relative to its earnings. A high PE ratio can indicate that investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock or index because they expect future earnings to be high. Conversely, a low PE ratio can indicate that investors expect future earnings to be low or that the stock or index is undervalued.The S&P 500 is a stock market index that represents the performance of 500 large publicly traded companies in the United States. The PE ratio of the S&P 500 can fluctuate over time due to various factors, such as changes in earnings expectations, interest rates, and market sentiment.In May 2009, the S&P 500 PE ratio was relatively high due in part to the impact of the global financial crisis that began in 2007. The crisis caused a significant drop in stock prices, which led to a decrease in earnings for many companies. As a result, the PE ratio of the S&P 500 was elevated because the index's price was relatively low while earnings were also low.It's important to note that the PE ratio is just one factor to consider when evaluating a stock or market index. It's important to look at other metrics, such as the price-to-book ratio and the dividend yield, as well as the overall economic and market conditions.""]",,finance,22982

What is a 10 Year Treasury Note and How Can it be Used to Calculate the Intrinsic Value of a Stock?,"['It\'s a form of debt issued by the United States Treasury. As the name implies, a 10-year note is held for 10 years (after which you get the face value in cash), and it pays interest twice per year. It\'s being used in the calculator to stand for a readily available, medium-term, nearly risk-free investment, as a means of ""discounting"" the value that the company gains. The explanation for why the discounting is done can be found on the page you linked. As a Canadian you could use the yield of comparable Canadian treasury securities as quoted by Bank of Canada (which seem to have had the bottom fall out since the new year), although I don\'t suppose American notes would be hard for a Canadian investor to come by, so if you wanted to be conservative you could use the US figure as long as it\'s higher.']","['A 10-year Treasury note is a debt obligation issued by the U.S. government that pays periodic interest to bondholders and returns the principal when the bond matures. Treasury notes have maturities ranging from a few months to 30 years and are issued in denominations of $100. They are considered to be a low-risk investment because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.The intrinsic value of a stock is the perceived or calculated value of a company, based on its fundamental characteristics such as earnings, dividends, and assets. The intrinsic value can be used as a benchmark to determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued in the market.One way to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock is to use the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. This involves estimating the future cash flows that the company is expected to generate, and then discounting those cash flows back to the present value using a discount rate. The discount rate used in the DCF calculation can be based on the yield on a 10-year Treasury note, as this yield reflects the risk-free rate of return.By incorporating the yield on a 10-year Treasury note into the DCF calculation, investors can compare the expected returns from investing in a particular stock to the risk-free rate of return. If the expected returns from the stock are higher than the risk-free rate, it may be considered undervalued and a potentially good investment. Conversely, if the expected returns are lower than the risk-free rate, the stock may be considered overvalued.']",,finance,21231
Discount Rate vs. IRR,"[""The IRR is the Discount Rate r* that makes Net Present Value NPV(r*)==0. What this boils down to is two ways of making the same kind of profitability calculation.  You can choose a project with NPV(10%)>0, or you can choose based on IRR>10%, and the idea is you get to the same set of projects.  That's if everything is well behaved mathematically. But that's not the end of this story of finance, math, and alphabet soup. For investments that have multiple positive and negative cash flows, finding that r* becomes solving for the roots of a polynomial in r*, so that there can be multiple roots.  Usually people use the lowest positive root but really it only makes sense for projects where NPV(r)>0 for r<r* and NPV(r)<0 for r>r*.   To try to help with your understanding, you can evaluate a real estate project with r=10%, find the sum future discounted cash flows, which is the NPV, and do the project if NPV>0.   Or, you can take the future cash flows of a project, find the NPV as a function of the rate r, and find r* where NPV(r*)==0. That r* is the IRR.  If IRR=r*>10% and the NPV function is well behaved as above, you can also do the project. When we don't have to worry about multiple roots, the preceding two paragraphs will select the same identical sets of projects as meeting the 10% return requirement.""]","[""The discount rate and the internal rate of return (IRR) are two financial concepts that are closely related, but they are not the same thing.The discount rate is a measure of the time value of money. It is used to determine the present value of a future cash flow. For example, if you expect to receive $100 in one year and the discount rate is 10%, the present value of that cash flow is $90.10 ($100 / (1 + 10%)). The discount rate takes into account the opportunity cost of not investing the money elsewhere, as well as the level of risk associated with the investment.The internal rate of return (IRR) is a measure of the profitability of an investment. It is the discount rate that equates the present value of the investment's cash flows to the initial investment. In other words, it is the rate at which the net present value (NPV) of the investment is zero. The IRR is used to compare different investment options and determine which one is the most attractive based on their expected returns.In summary, the discount rate is used to determine the present value of a future cash flow, while the IRR is a measure of the profitability of an investment.""]",,finance,22313

There can be quick judgments made on things which may or may not be true in the end.  After all, who knows exactly what is causing the sell-off.  Is it a bunch of stop orders being triggered?

I was given a 1099-misc instead of a w-2 what are my next steps?,"['I agree that you should have received both a 1099 and a W2 from your employer. They may be reluctant to do that because some people believe that could trigger an IRS audit. The reason is that independent contractor vs employee is supposed to be defined by your job function, not by your choice. If you were a contractor and then switched to be an employee without changing your job description, then the IRS could claim that you should have always been an employee the entire time, and so should every one of the other contractors that work for that company with a similar job function. It\'s a hornet\'s nest that the employer may not want to poke. But that\'s not your problem; what should you do about it? When you say ""he added my Federal and FICA W/H together"", do you mean that total appears in box 4 of your 1099? If so, it sounds like the employer is expecting you to re-pay the employer portion of FICA. Can you ask them if they actually paid it? If they did, then I don\'t see them having a choice but to issue a W2, since the IRS would be expecting one. If they didn\'t pay your FICA, then the amount this will cost you is 7.65% of what would have been your W2 wages. IMHO it would be reasonable for you to request that they send you a check for that extra amount. Note: even though that amount will be less than $600 and you won\'t receive a 1099 in 2017 for it, legally you\'ll still have to pay tax on that amount so I think a good estimate would be to call it 10% instead. Depending on your personality and your relationship with the employer, if they choose not to ""make you whole"", you could threaten to fill out form SS-8. Additional Info: (Thank you Bobson for bringing this up.) The situation you find yourself in is similar to the concept of ""Contract-to-Hire"". You start off as a contractor, and later convert to an employee. In order to avoid issuing a 1099 and W2 to the same person in a single tax year, companies typically utilize one of the following strategies: Your particular situation is closest to situation 2, but the reverse. Instead of retroactively calling you a W2 employee the entire time, your employer is cheating and attempting to classify you as a 1099 contractor the entire time. This is frowned upon by the IRS, as well as the employee since as you discovered it costs you more money in the form of employer FICA. From your description it sounds like your employer was trying to do you a favor and didn\'t quite follow through with it. What they should have done was never switch you to W2 in the first place (if you really should have been a contractor), or they should have done the conversion properly without stringing you along.']","[""If you received a 1099-MISC form instead of a W-2, it generally means that you were paid as an independent contractor rather than an employee. As an independent contractor, you are responsible for paying your own taxes, rather than having them withheld from your pay by an employer.Here are the steps you should take:Determine your tax liability: You will need to calculate the total amount of income you received as an independent contractor and determine the amount of tax you owe on that income. You may need to pay self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax.File a tax return: If you received more than $400 in income as an independent contractor, you are required to file a tax return. You can use IRS Form 1040 to report your independent contractor income and calculate your tax liability.Pay your taxes: If you owe taxes, you will need to pay them by the tax filing deadline, which is typically April 15th. You can make a payment online, by phone, or by mail using a check or money order.Keep good records: It's important to keep good records of your independent contractor income and any expenses you incur in the course of your work. This will make it easier to file your tax return and claim any deductions or credits that you may be eligible for.If you have any questions or are uncertain about how to file your taxes as an independent contractor, you may want to consult with a tax professional or refer to IRS guidance on the subject.""]",,finance,19411

Why do some people say a house “not an investment”?,"['There\'s an old saying:  ""Never invest in anything that eats or needs maintenance."" This doesn\'t mean that a house or a racehorse or private ownership of your own company is not an investment.  It just points out that constant effort is needed on your part, or on the part of somebody you pay, just to keep it from losing value.  Common stock, gold, and money in the bank are three things you can buy and leave alone.  They may gain or lose market value, but not because of neglect on your part. Buying a house is a complex decision.  There are many benefits and many risks.

One reason is that a house is a consumption good, meaning that it is used for living in rather than generating income. While a house may appreciate in value over time, it does not produce any income or profits in the way that a business or financial investment might.Another reason is that a house is a non-liquid asset, meaning that it is difficult to sell quickly or convert into cash. This can make it difficult to access the equity that you have built up in your home, especially in a down market or if you need to sell for financial reasons.Finally, owning a house involves ongoing costs such as property taxes, maintenance, and repairs, which can eat into any potential returns.Overall, it is important to consider the costs and risks associated with owning a house, as well as the potential for appreciation, when deciding whether it is a good investment for you.']",,finance,22634
"Buying a house, how much should my down payment be?","[""How much should my down payment be? Ideally 20% of the purchase price because with 20% of the purchase price, you don't have to pay a costly private mortgage insurance (PMI).  If you don't have 20% down and come across a good property to purchase, it is still a good idea to go forward with purchasing with what you are comfortable with, because renting long term is generally never a good idea if you want to build wealth and become financially independent. How much should I keep in my emergency fund? People say 3-12 months of living expenses.  Keep in mind though, in most cases, if you lose your job, you are entitled to unemployment benefits from the government. How long should my mortgage be? 30 year amortization is the best. You can always opt to pay more each month.  But having that leverage with a 30 year loan can allow you to invest your savings in other opportunities, which can yield more than mortgage interest. Best of luck!""]","['The size of your down payment on a house will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of the home, the type of mortgage you are obtaining, and your personal financial situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:Conventional wisdom suggests that you should aim for a down payment of at least 20% of the purchase price of the home. This is because mortgage lenders typically require a down payment of at least 20% in order to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is an insurance policy that protects the lender in case you default on your loan. PMI can add significantly to your monthly mortgage payments, so avoiding it can save you a significant amount of money over the life of your loan.However, it is possible to obtain a mortgage with a down payment of less than 20%. Many lenders offer programs that allow you to put down as little as 3% or even 0% in some cases. These loans typically come with higher interest rates and may require you to pay PMI, so they may not be the best option if you have the means to make a larger down payment.In addition to the size of your down payment, you should also consider other factors such as your overall financial situation, your ability to save for a down payment, and your long-term financial goals. It may be worth saving up for a larger down payment if it means you can get a lower interest rate on your mortgage, or if it means you will have more equity in your home. On the other hand, if you have the opportunity to buy a home with a smaller down payment and it makes sense for your financial situation, it may be worth considering.Ultimately, the size of your down payment will depend on your personal financial circumstances and your long-term financial goals. It is important to carefully consider all of these factors before making a decision about how much to put down on a house.']",,finance,19152
How dividend payout happens,"[""The ex-dividend date is the first date on which you may sell without losing your dividend.  In this case that date is August 5th (thanks, Victor).

This decision is typically based on the company\'s financial performance and its plans for future growth.The company determines the amount of the dividend and the date it will be paid.

"When I ask a broker to buy stock, what does the broker do?","['My answer isn\'t a full one, but that\'s because I think the answer depends on, at minimum, the country your broker is in, the type of order you place (limit, market, algo, etc.,) and the size of your order.

I only get filled from that one exchange and this happens noticeably after I see my limit price print, and my fills are always better than my limit price. Whereas with my US-based broker, I can see my regular lotsize limit order in the order book (depth of book data) prior to any fills.  I will routinely be notified of a fill before I see the limit price print.  And my fills come from any number of US exchanges (NYSE, ARCA, BATS, etc.) even for the same stock.

The Purpose of Change Machines ,"['I think you\'re talking about two types of machines, at least in the United States. The term change  machine usually refers to a machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller bills or coins. Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency, in which case they are also often known as bill changers. Exactly what bills or coins these machines return depends on the machine. Read the instructions on the machine to get the details (they\'re usually right on the machine). For example my apartment building has a machine that converts small bills like ones and fives to quarters, since the laundry machines only took quarters. The other type of machine are coin-cashing machines, like the Coinstar machines you might see at a grocery store. Many banks used to have these machines as well although in my area they\'re few and far between now. These machines perform the opposite function of the traditional change machine and convert smaller denominations (mostly coins) into bill form. For example if you dump all your accumulated pennies into the machine, it will probably give you bills and larger coins like quarters, dimes, nickels in exchange, after subtracting a small fee. I\'ve heard that now, some of these machines may give you a gift card of some kind instead of bills, although they\'ll still subtract a fee from your original amount, usually. Once again just read the instructions and they should tell you. When my bank had one of these machines, they didn\'t charge a fee as long as you were a customer at the bank. I\'m sure that varies from place to place and bank to bank though. Wikipedia\'s article has this to say (see the article for references): In some sections of the U.S., regional banks have begun offering free coin-counting services in the amount of a gift card. Refunds are often given in cash rather than in the form of a gift card. In some cases, it is not even necessary for the customer to have an account at the bank; the free service is offered as a way to attract new business from individuals who are not current account holders. TD Bank\'s ""Penny Arcade"" coin counters were free and available to both customers and non-customers in many branches, but as of November 2010, the bank charges a 6% fee for non-customers to use the machine.']","['Change machines, also known as bill changers or bill breakers, are machines that dispense coins or bills in exchange for a larger denomination of currency. They are commonly found in places such as laundromats, amusement parks, and vending machine locations where it is convenient for customers to have smaller denominations of money for transactions.Change machines can be programmed to accept a variety of different denominations of bills and coins, and they typically dispense change in the form of smaller bills and coins. Some change machines also have the capability to accept credit or debit card payments and dispense change in the form of a printed receipt.Change machines are useful because they allow customers to easily obtain smaller denominations of currency without having to go to a bank or store to make a purchase. This can be particularly convenient for customers who may not have access to a bank or who need to make a small purchase but only have a large bill on hand.Overall, the purpose of change machines is to provide a convenient way for customers to obtain smaller denominations of currency for transactions.']",,finance,21708
"Companies that use their cash to buy back stock, issue dividends, etc. — how does this this typically affect share price?","['If a company is valued correctly, then paying dividends should lower the share price, and buying back shares should leave the share price unchanged.  If the share price is $100, and the company pays a $10 dividend, then either its cash goes down by $10 per share, it is has to borrow money for the same amount, or some mixture. Either way, the value of the company has gone down by $10 per share.  If the share price is $100, and the company buys back 10 percent of its shares, then it also has to find the money, just as for the dividend, and the value of the company goes down by 10 percent. However, the number of shares also goes down by 10 percent, so the amount of value per share is the same, and the share price should stay unchanged.  Now there are psychological effects. Many people like getting paid dividends, so they will want to own shares of a company paying dividends, so the share price goes up. Similar with a share buyback; the fact that someone buys huge amounts of shares drives the price up. Both effects are purely psychological.  A buyback has another effect if the shares are not valued correctly. If the company is worth $100 per share but for some reason the shareprice is down to $50, then after the buyback the value per share has even gone up. Basically the company buys from stupid investors, which increases the value for clever investors holding on to their shares. If the shareprice were $200, then buying back shares would be a stupid move for the company.']","['Share buybacks, also known as stock buybacks, are a way for companies to reduce the number of outstanding shares of their stock on the market. This can increase the value of the remaining shares, because there is less supply and the same or a growing demand for the stock. As a result, the price of the stock may increase after the buyback is announced or completed.Dividends, on the other hand, are payments made by a company to its shareholders out of its profits. Dividends can be paid in the form of cash or additional shares of stock. If a company announces that it will be paying a dividend, this may also increase the demand for the stock, which could lead to an increase in the stock price.However, it is important to note that the impact of buybacks and dividends on the stock price will depend on a variety of factors, including the overall performance of the company and the market conditions. In some cases, buybacks and dividends may not have a significant effect on the stock price, or the price may even decline.', ""Stock buybacks and dividends can affect the share price of a company in different ways.Stock buybacks: When a company buys back its own shares, it reduces the number of outstanding shares on the market, which can increase the demand for the remaining shares and potentially drive up the share price. However, it's worth noting that buybacks are not always a good thing for shareholders. For example, if a company is using its cash to buy back stock instead of investing in the business or paying down debt, it may not be creating value for shareholders in the long run.Dividends: Dividends are payments made to shareholders out of a company's profits. When a company announces that it will be paying a dividend, the share price may go up because investors see the dividend as a sign of financial stability and a way to generate income from their investment. However, it's also worth noting that when a company starts paying dividends, it may also be a signal that the company is not expecting to have significant growth opportunities in the near future, which could lead to a decline in the share price.In general, the effect of buybacks and dividends on share price will depend on the specific circumstances of the company and the market conditions at the time.

Putting the gordon equation into practice,"[""The Gordon equation does not use inflation-adjusted numbers. It uses nominal returns/dividends and growth rates. It really says nothing anyone would not already know.  Everyone knows that your total return equals the sum of the income return plus capital gains.   Gordon simply assumes (perfectly validly) that capital gains will be driven by the growth of earnings, and that the dividends paid will likewise increase at the same rate. So he used the 'dividend growth rate' as a proxy for the 'earnings growth rate' or 'capital gains rate'. You cannot use inflation-removed estimates of equity rates of return because those returns do not change with inflation.  If anything they move in opposite directions.  Eg in the 1970's inflation the high market rates caused people to discount equity values at larger rates --- driving their values down -- creating losses.""]","['The Gordon equation is a mathematical relationship used to estimate the intrinsic rate of growth or decline of a population. It is written as:r = rmax * S / (K + S)where:r is the intrinsic rate of growth or decline of the populationrmax is the maximum intrinsic rate of growth or decline of the populationS is the current population sizeK is the carrying capacity of the environmentTo use the Gordon equation, you need to know or estimate the values of rmax, S, and K for the population you are studying. You can then plug these values into the equation to calculate the intrinsic rate of growth or decline of the population.It is important to note that the Gordon equation is just a model, and actual population growth or decline may deviate from the predicted values due to various factors such as changes in the environment, interactions with other species, and stochastic events.']",,finance,22675
"Selling property outside the US - gains are taxable, but how do they convert?","['Since you did not treat the house as a QBU, you have to use USD as your functional currency.  To calculate capital gains, you need to calculate the USD value at the time of purchase using the exchange rate at the time of purchase and the USD value at the time of sale using the exchange rate at the time of sale.  The capital gain / loss is then the difference between the two.  This link describes it in more detail and provides some references: http://www.maximadvisors.com/2013/06/foreign-residence/ That link also discusses additional potential complications if you have a mortgage on the house. This link gives more detail on the court case referenced in the above link: http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs5/93F3d26.html The court cases references Rev. Rul 54-105.  This link from the IRS has some details from that (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/0303021.pdf): Rev. Rul. 54-105, 1954-1 C.B. 12, states that for purposes of determining   gain, the basis and selling price of property acquired by a U.S. citizen living in a foreign country should be expressed in United States dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing as of the dates of purchase and sale of the property,   respectively. The text of this implies it is for U.S. citizen is living in a foreign country, but the court case makes it clear that it also applies in your scenario (house purchased while living abroad but now residing in the US): Appellants agree that the 453,374 pounds received for their residence should be translated into U.S. dollars at the $1.82 exchange rate prevailing at the date of sale. They argue, however, that the 343,147 pound adjusted cost basis of the residence, consisting of the 297,500 pound purchase price and the 45,647 pounds paid for capital improvements, likewise should be expressed in U.S. dollar terms as of the date of the sale. Appellants correctly state that, viewed “in the foreign currency in which it was transacted,” the purchase generated a 110,227 pound gain as of the date of the sale, which translates to approximately $200,000 at the $1.82 per pound exchange rate. ... However fair and reasonable their argument may be, it amounts to an untenable attempt to convert their “functional currency” from the U.S. dollar to the pound sterling. ... Under I.R.C. § 985(b)(1), use of a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is restricted to qualified business units (""QBU""s). ... appellants correctly assert that their residence was purchased “for a pound-denominated value” while they were “living and working in a pound-denominated economy,” ... And since appellants concede that the purchase and sale of their residence was not carried out by a QBU, the district court properly rejected their plea to treat the pound as their functional currency.']","['If you sell property that is located outside the United States, you will need to report the sale on your U.S. tax return and pay tax on any gain that you realize from the sale. The gain from the sale of the property will be calculated in the same way as it would be for property located within the United States.To calculate the gain, you will need to determine the difference between the sales price and your tax basis in the property. Your tax basis is generally the cost of the property, including any improvements that you made to it, plus any closing costs associated with the purchase. If you have owned the property for a long time, you may have a higher tax basis due to depreciation that you have claimed over the years.If the sales price is greater than your tax basis, you will have a gain on the sale. The gain will be taxed at the applicable capital gains tax rate, which depends on your income tax bracket.If you receive payment for the sale of the property in a foreign currency, you will need to convert the amount of the sale to U.S. dollars in order to report it on your tax return. You can use the exchange rate that was in effect on the date of the sale. If you receive multiple payments for the sale of the property, you will need to convert each payment to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate that was in effect on the date of each payment.It is important to keep good records of the sale of the property, including documentation of the sales price, the tax basis in the property, and any closing costs or other expenses associated with the sale.

Which shareholders cause news-driven whole market stock swings?,['News-driven investors tend to be very short-term focussed investors. They often trade by using index futures (on the S&P 500 index for instance).'],"['News-driven stock market swings can be caused by a variety of factors, including the actions of individual shareholders, as well as broader market forces and economic events. Some examples of events that can cause stock market swings include the release of earnings reports, changes in government policies or regulations, and geopolitical developments.It is important to note that stock market movements can be influenced by a wide range of factors, and it can be difficult to identify the specific actions or decisions of individual shareholders that may have caused a particular market swing. Additionally, the stock market is often influenced by the collective actions of many different shareholders, rather than the actions of any single individual or group.In general, it is important for investors to keep track of market news and developments, and to consider the potential impact of these events on their investments. However, it is also important to maintain a long-term perspective and not to make investment decisions based on short-term market movements alone.', ""News-driven stock market swings can be caused by a variety of factors, including the release of economic data, changes in government policies, and unexpected events such as natural disasters or corporate scandals. However, it is important to note that stock market movements are not necessarily driven by individual shareholders. Rather, they are the result of the collective actions of all market participants, including retail investors, institutional investors, and traders.In some cases, the actions of a single large shareholder or a group of shareholders may have an impact on a company's stock price. For example, if a major shareholder announces that they are selling a large portion of their shares in a company, this may cause the stock price to decline due to increased supply and reduced demand. Similarly, if a major shareholder announces that they are buying a large number of shares in a company, this may cause the stock price to rise due to increased demand.It is worth noting, however, that the impact of any individual shareholder on the overall stock market is likely to be relatively small compared to the broader economic and market forces that drive stock prices.""]",,finance,22202
"Should I consolidate loans and cards, or just cards, leaving multiple loans?","['First of all, congratulations on admitting your problem and on your determination to be debt-free.  Recognizing your mistakes is a huge first step, and getting rid of your debt is a very worthwhile goal. When considering debt consolidation, there are really only two reasons to do so: Reason #1: To lower your monthly payment.  If you are having trouble coming up with enough money to meet your monthly obligations, debt consolidation can lower your monthly payment by extending the time frame of the debt.  The problem with this one is that it doesn\'t help you get out of debt faster.  It actually makes it longer before you are out of debt and will increase the total amount of interest that you will pay to the banks before you are done.  So I would not recommend debt consolidation for this reason unless you are truly struggling with your cashflow because your minimum monthly payments are too high.  In your situation, it does not sound like you need to consolidate for this reason. Reason #2: To lower your interest rate.  If your debt is at a very high rate, debt consolidation can lower your interest rate, which can reduce the time it will take to eliminate your debt. The consolidation loan you are considering is at a high interest rate on its own: 13.89%.  Now, it is true that some of your debt is higher than that, but it looks like the majority of your debt is less than that rate.  It doesn\'t sound to me that you will save a significant amount of money by consolidating in this loan.  If you can obtain a better consolidation loan in the future, it might be worth considering. From your question, it looks like your reasoning for the consolidation loan is to close the credit card accounts as quickly as possible.  I agree that you need to quit using the cards, but this can also be accomplished by destroying the cards.  The consolidation loan is not needed for this. You also mentioned that you are considering adding $3,000 to your debt.  I have to say that it doesn\'t make sense at all to me to add to your debt (especially at 13.89%) when your goal is to eliminate your debt.  To answer your question explicitly, yes, the ""cash buffer"" from the loan is a very bad idea. Here is what I recommend: (This is based on this answer, but customized for you.) Cut up/destroy your credit cards.  Today.  You\'ve already recognized that they are a problem for you.  Cash, checks, and debit cards are what you need to use from now on. Start working from a monthly budget, assigning a job for every dollar that you have.  This will allow you to decide what to spend your money on, rather than arriving at the end of the month with no idea where your money was lost.  Budgeting software can make this task easier.  (See this question for more information. Your first goal should be to put a small amount of money in a savings account, perhaps $1000 - $1500 total.  This is the start of your emergency fund.  This money will ensure that if something unexpected and urgent comes up, you won\'t be so cash poor that you need to borrow money again.  Note: this money should only be touched in an actual emergency, and if spent, should be replenished as soon as possible.  At the rate you are talking about, it should take you less than a month to do this. After you\'ve got your small emergency fund in place, attack the debt as quickly and aggressively as possible.  The order that you pay off your debts is not significant. (The optimal method is up for debate.)  At the rate you suggested ($2,000 - 2,500 per month), you can be completely debt free in maybe 18 months. As you pay off those credit cards, completely close the accounts.  Ignore the conventional wisdom that tells you to leave the unused credit card accounts open to try to preserve a few points on your credit score.  Just close them. After you are completely debt free, take the money that you were throwing at your debt, and use it to build up your emergency fund until it is 3-6 months\' worth of your expenses.  That way, you\'ll be able to handle a small crisis without borrowing anything. If you need more help/motivation on becoming debt free and budgeting, I recommend the book The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey.']","['It can be a good idea to consolidate loans and credit card debt if it will help you manage your debt more effectively and potentially save money on interest. There are a few factors to consider when deciding whether to consolidate your loans and credit card debt:Interest rates: If you have high-interest credit card debt and low-interest loans, it may be more beneficial to focus on paying off the credit card debt first. On the other hand, if you have high-interest loans and lower-interest credit card debt, consolidating the loans and paying off the credit card debt separately may make more sense.Credit score: Consolidating your debt can potentially lower your credit score in the short term, especially if you open a new line of credit to pay off your existing debts. However, if you can successfully pay off your consolidated debt and improve your credit utilization, your credit score may improve over time.Payment terms: Consolidating your debt may change the terms of your payments, such as the length of your repayment period or the frequency of your payments. Make sure you understand how consolidation will affect your payments and budget accordingly.Ultimately, the decision to consolidate your debt will depend on your individual financial situation. It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor or a credit counselor to explore your options and determine the best course of action for your specific needs.']",,finance,20364

Why is the breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest of any importance?,"[""The reason it's broken out is very specific: this is showing you how much interest accrued during the month.  It is the only place that's shown, typically. Each month's (minimum) payment is the sum of [the interest accrued during that month] and [some principal], say M=I+P, and B is your total loan balance.  That I is fixed at the amount of interest that accrued that month - you always must pay off the accrued interest.  It changes each month as some of the principal is reduced; if you have a 3% daily interest rate, you owe (0.03*B*31) approximately (plus a bit as the interest on the interest accrues) each month (or *30 or *28).  Since B is going down constantly as principal is paid off, I is also going down. The P is most commonly calculated based on an amortization table, such that you have a fixed payment amount each month and pay the loan off after a certain period of time.  That's why P changes each month - because it's easier for people to have a constant monthly payment M, than to have a fixed P and variable I for a variable M. As such, it's important to show you the I amount, both so you can verify that the loan is being correctly charged/paid, and for your tax purposes.""]","['The breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest is important because it helps borrowers understand how their loan is structured and how each payment is applied. When you make a loan payment, a portion of the payment goes towards paying off the principal, or the amount of money you borrowed, and the remainder goes towards paying the interest, or the cost of borrowing the money.Understanding this breakdown can be helpful for a number of reasons. For example, if you know that a large portion of your payment is going towards interest, you may decide to try to pay off the loan as quickly as possible to reduce the amount of interest you pay overall. On the other hand, if you know that a large portion of your payment is going towards the principal, you may decide to make extra payments or pay off the loan early in order to pay off the debt more quickly.In addition, understanding the breakdown of your loan repayment can help you plan your budget and financial goals. For example, if you know that a significant portion of your monthly income is going towards loan payments, you may need to adjust your spending habits in order to afford your other financial obligations.']",,finance,22460
What is the difference between fixed-income duration and equity duration?,"[""A bond has a duration that can be easily calculated. It's the time weighted average of all the payments you'll receive and helpful to understand the effect a change in rates will have on that instrument.

I can calculate the duration of a bond and come up with an answer that's not up for discussion or dispute. The duration of a stock, on the other hand, isn't such a number. Will J&J last 50 more years? Will Apple? Who knows?""]","[""Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a bond to changes in interest rates. It is expressed in years, and tells you how much the price of a bond will change if interest rates move by 1%. For example, if a bond has a duration of 10 years, and interest rates increase by 1%, the price of the bond is expected to fall by 10%.Fixed-income duration refers to the duration of a fixed-income security, such as a bond. Equity duration refers to the duration of an equity security, such as a stock.Fixed-income securities tend to have longer durations than equity securities, because the cash flows from fixed-income securities are more predictable and occur over a longer period of time. As a result, the price of a fixed-income security is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the price of an equity security.It's important to note that duration is just one measure of risk, and it's not the only factor that investors should consider when evaluating the risk of a security.

How and why does the exchange rate of a currency change almost everyday?,"['Money is money because people believe it is money. By ""believe it is money"", I mean that they expect they will be able to turn it into useful goods or services (food, rent, houses, truckloads full of iron ore, mining equipment, massages at the spa, helicopter rides, iPads, greenhouses, income streams to support your future retirement, etc). Foreign exchange rates change because people\'s ideas about how much useful goods or services they can get with various currencies change. For example: if the Zimbabwe government suddenly printed 10 times as much money as used to exist, you probably couldn\'t use that money to buy as much food at the Zimbabwe-Mart, so you wouldn\'t be willing to give people as many US-dollars (which can buy food at the US-Mart) for a Zimbabwe-dollar as you used to be able to. (It\'s not exactly that easy, because - for instance - food in the US is more useful to me than food in Zimbabwe. But people still move around all sorts of things, like oil, or agricultural products, or minerals, or electronics components.) The two main things that affect the value of a currency are the size of the economy that it\'s tied to (how much stuff there is to get), and how much of the currency there is / how fast it\'s moving around the economy (which tells you how much money there is to get it with). So most exchange rate shifts reflect a change in people\'s expectations for a regional economy, or the size of a money supply. (Also, Zimbabwe is doing much better now that it\'s ditched their own currency - they kept printing trillions of dollars\' worth - and just trade in US dollars. Their economy still needs some work, but... better.)']","['The exchange rate of a currency is the price at which one currency can be exchanged for another. It is determined by the supply and demand for a particular currency in the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market is a global decentralized market that determines the relative values of different currencies.There are several factors that can affect the supply and demand for a particular currency and, in turn, its exchange rate. Some of the most important factors include:Interest rates: Higher interest rates can attract foreign investment and increase demand for a particular currency, causing its value to appreciate (rise). Conversely, lower interest rates can discourage foreign investment and reduce demand for a particular currency, causing its value to depreciate (fall).Inflation: Higher inflation rates can erode the purchasing power of a particular currency, causing its value to depreciate. Conversely, lower inflation rates can increase the purchasing power of a particular currency, causing its value to appreciate.Political stability: Political instability or uncertainty can make a particular currency less attractive to investors and traders, causing its value to depreciate.

How can I spend less?,"['There are many tactics you can use.  If your biggest problem is regretting your larger purchases, I\'d suggest giving yourself rules before making any purchases over a certain minimum dollar amount that you set for yourself.  For example, if that amount is $50 for an item, then any item starting at an average price of $51 would be subject to these rules. One of your long-term goals ought to be to become the kind of person who finds joy in saving money rather than spending it.  Make friends with frugal people - look for those who prefer games nights and potlucks to nights out at the club buying expensive drinks and dinners at the newest steak joint in town.  Learn the thrill of a deal, but even more learn the thrill of your savings growing.  You don\'t want to enjoy money in the bank for the purposes of becoming a miser.  Instead you want to realize that money in the bank helps you achieve your goals\xa0— buying the house you want, donating a significant amount of money to a cause you ardently support, allowing you to take a dream vacation, letting you buy with cash the car you always wanted, the possibilities are endless.  As Dave Ramsey says, ""Live like no one else, so you can live like no one else.""']","[""There are several ways you can try to spend less money:Make a budget: Start by tracking your expenses to see where your money is going. Then, create a budget that allocates your money to your essential expenses (such as housing, food, and transportation) and non-essential expenses (such as dining out or entertainment). This will help you see where you can cut back.Cut unnecessary expenses: Look for areas where you can trim your expenses. Do you really need that expensive cable package or could you switch to a cheaper streaming service? Can you pack your lunch instead of eating out every day? Are you paying for any subscriptions or memberships that you don't use or need?Shop around for the best prices: Take the time to compare prices before you make a purchase. Look for sales and discounts, and consider using cashback or rewards credit cards to save even more.Use cash or debit cards instead of credit cards: Credit cards can be convenient, but they can also make it easy to overspend. Consider using cash or debit cards instead, which can help you stick to your budget.Find ways to increase your income: If you're struggling to make ends meet, consider looking for ways to increase your income. This could involve taking on additional work, starting a side hustle, or negotiating a raise at your current job.Remember that the key to spending less is to be mindful of your spending habits and to make conscious decisions about how you use your money. It may take some effort and discipline, but with a little bit of planning, you can start to save more and spend less."", ""There are many ways to spend less, and the specific strategies that will work best for you will depend on your financial situation and your personal spending habits.

What could be the harm in sharing my American Express statements online?,"['As a person who has had several part time assistants in the past I will offer you a simple piece of advise that should apply regardless of what country the assistant is located. If you have an assistant, personal or business, virtual or otherwise, and you don\'t trust that person with this type of information, get a different assistant.  An assistant is someone who is supposed to make your life easier by off loading work. Modifying your records before sending them every month sounds like you are creating more work for yourself not less. Either take the leap of faith to trust your assistant or go somewhere else.  An assistant that you feel you have to edit crucial information from is less than useful. That being said, there is no fundamental reason to believe that an operation in the Philippines or anywhere else is any more or less trustworthy than an operation in your native country. However, what is at issue is the legal framework around your relationship and in particular your recourse if something goes wrong.  If you and your virtual assistant are both located in the US you would have an easier time collecting damages should something go wrong.  I suggest you evaluate your level of comfort for risk vs. cost.  If you feel that the risk is too high to use an overseas service versus the savings, then find someone in the states to do this work.  Depending on your needs and comfort you might want to seek out a CPA or other licensed/bonded professional.  Yes the cost might be higher however you might find that it is worth it for your own piece of mind. As a side note you might even consider finding a local part-time assistant. This can often be more useful than a virtual assistant and may not cost as much as you think. If you can live without someone being bonded.  (or are willing to pay for the bonding fee) yourself,  depending on your market and needs you may be able to find an existing highly qualified EA or other person that wants some after hours work.   If you are in a college town, finance, accounting or legal majors make great assistants.  They will usually work a couple hours a week for ""beer money"", they have flexible schedules and are glad to have something pertinent to their degree to put on their resume when they graduate.  Just be prepared to replace them every few years as they move on to real jobs.']","[""Sharing your American Express statements online could potentially expose your personal and financial information to others, which could put you at risk for identity theft or financial fraud.

Mortgage loan implications when tearing down existing house and building new one?,"['You would probably be best off checking through your loan documents to see if anything is listed in it in regards to tearing down the existing house.

Semi related question (answers have some good info) -  Construction loan for new house replacing existing mortgaged house?']","[""If you are considering tearing down an existing house and building a new one, there are several mortgage loan implications to consider.First, you will need to obtain financing for the construction of the new house. This can typically be done through a construction loan, which is a short-term loan that provides funds to cover the cost of building the new house. Construction loans typically require a down payment of at least 20% of the total cost of the project, and the loan is typically paid off once the construction is complete and the house is sold or refinanced.It's important to note that construction loans can be more expensive and have higher interest rates than traditional mortgages, as they involve a higher level of risk for the lender. You may also be required to have a higher credit score and a higher debt-to-income ratio to qualify for a construction loan.In addition to obtaining financing for the construction of the new house, you will also need to consider the financing for the land on which the new house will be built. If you already own the land, you may be able to use the equity in the land as collateral for the construction loan. If you need to purchase the land, you will need to obtain a separate mortgage loan to finance the purchase.Finally, it's important to consider the tax implications of tearing down an existing house and building a new one. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to claim certain tax deductions or credits for the construction of the new house, such as the cost of materials, labor, and design fees. You should consult with a tax professional to determine what tax implications apply in your situation.""]",,finance,19177

Do you want to save for a down payment on a house, retire early, or something else? Setting clear financial goals can help you decide how to allocate your investment dollars.Make a budget: In order to invest, you'll need to have some money set aside. A budget can help you determine how much you can afford to save and invest each month.Educate yourself: It's important to have a basic understanding of investing before you start. You can learn about different types of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and how they work. There are many resources available to help you learn about investing, including online courses, books, and financial advisors.Consider working with a financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you create a customized investment plan based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and other factors. They can also help you choose the right investments for your portfolio and provide ongoing guidance as your financial situation changes.Start small: You don't have to have a lot of money to get started with investing. Many investment platforms, such as robo-advisors and brokerage firms, allow you to start investing with as little as a few hundred dollars.Remember to always do your own research and carefully consider your investment options before making any decisions.

Instead, the doctor mentioned that you have asthmatic bronchitis, which is a condition in which the airways in the lungs (the bronchi) become inflamed due to asthma. The X-ray may have shown slight coarsening of the bronchovascular markings, which refers to the small lines and patterns that can be seen on the X-ray and represent the bronchi and blood vessels in the lungs. The costophrenic angles, which are the corners formed by the ribs and the lining of the lung, are described as being sharp, which is a normal finding. The heart is not enlarged and the aorta, which is the main blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body, is uncoiled, which means it is not twisted or turned in an abnormal way. Overall, it appears that the X-ray showed no significant abnormalities or concerns. It is important to note that X-rays can only show the structure of the organs and tissues in the body, and they may not always be able to detect certain conditions or diseases.

Cancer in the chest cavity and around the aorta can be a serious condition and the treatment will depend on several factors, including the type and stage of the cancer, the overall health of your dad, and his personal preferences.\n\nThe first step in treating cancer is usually to perform a biopsy, which is a procedure to remove a small sample of tissue from the tumor to be examined under a microscope. This will help the doctors determine the type and stage of the cancer, which will help guide the treatment plan.\n\nThere are several treatment options for cancer in the chest cavity and around the aorta, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Your dad's treatment plan will depend on the type and stage of the cancer, as well as his overall health and personal preferences.\n\nSurgery may be an option to remove the cancerous tissue. This may be done through a traditional open surgery, or it may be done laparoscopically, which is a minimally invasive procedure that uses small incisions and specialized instruments.\n\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells. This may be used in combination with chemotherapy or as a standalone treatment.\n\nChemotherapy involves using medications to kill cancer cells. These medications may be given orally or intravenously, and they may be used in combination with other treatments, such as surgery or radiation therapy.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that each person's cancer and treatment plan is unique, and the best course of action will depend on many factors. I recommend discussing all of the treatment options and their potential risks and benefits with your dad's healthcare team, as well as seeking a second opinion if desired."", ""I'm sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis.

Regards,Jay Indravadan Patel,Physical Therapist or Physiotherapist""]","[""It's always important to speak with a healthcare professional about any health concerns you may have. However, here are some general treatment options for the conditions you mentioned:\n\nRheumatoid arthritis: Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis typically involves a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can help reduce inflammation and slow the progression of the disease. Physical therapy, exercise, and assistive devices such as canes or splints can also be helpful in managing the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHeadache: There are many different types of headaches, and treatment will depend on the specific type and severity of the headache. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can often be effective in relieving mild to moderate headaches. More severe headaches may require prescription medications or other treatments. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific headache.\n\nJaw pain: Jaw pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including teeth grinding, jaw injury, or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the jaw pain. In some cases, over-the-counter pain relievers or ice packs can help reduce inflammation and relieve discomfort. Other treatments may include physical therapy, bite guards, or medication to relax the muscles in the jaw.\n\nLow blood pressure: Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions. Treatment for low blood pressure may include increasing fluid intake, increasing salt intake, and taking medications to raise blood pressure. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific case of low blood pressure.\n\nTinnitus: Tinnitus is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears that is not caused by an external source. There is no cure for tinnitus, but there are several treatment options that can help manage the symptoms. These may include sound therapy, counseling, and medications to relieve anxiety or depression. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment approach for your specific case of tinnitus.\n\nAgain, it's important to speak with a healthcare professional about your specific health concerns and treatment options. They will be able to take into account your individual circumstances and medical history to recommend the most appropriate treatment plan for you.""]",,medicine,23376
"What causes difficulty to support weight while standing?Hello, my daughter is 9 months old and cannot support her own weight in a standing position. When I try to let her stand she bends forward at the waist. When she stands upright, it is on her toes and only for a few seconds. She is extremely flexible in the hips and has just now started doing an army low-crawl. What do you think is going on?","[""It's too early to make her stand and watch for her age of 9m and as long she could sit unsupported and crawl, it's Ok for the age. Sometimes joint laxity can show extreme flexibility but that too it's early to decide and wait till 12-18 months for reassessment.""]","[""It is normal for infants to develop the ability to support their own weight and stand upright at different ages. Most infants begin to pull themselves up to a standing position around 9-12 months of age and can stand unsupported around 12-15 months of age. However, every child is different and some may develop these skills earlier or later than others.\n\nThere are several factors that can affect an infant's ability to support their own weight and stand upright. These include muscle strength and coordination, balance, and overall physical development. Infants also need to learn how to use their muscles to control their movements and maintain their balance.\n\nIf your daughter is 9 months old and is having difficulty supporting her own weight and standing upright, it is possible that she simply needs more time to develop the necessary muscle strength and coordination. Encourage her to practice standing and moving around, but always supervise her to ensure that she is safe. If you are concerned about her development, it is always a good idea to consult with your pediatrician for further evaluation and guidance.""]",,medicine,23727

Hope my answer helps you. Regards']","[""If you are trying to get pregnant and have irregular periods, it may be helpful to track your menstrual cycle and try to identify any patterns or predict when you are most likely to ovulate. Ovulation is the process of the release of an egg from the ovary, and it is necessary for pregnancy to occur.\n\nThere are several ways you can track your menstrual cycle and try to predict when you are ovulating:\n\nKeep a menstrual calendar: This involves tracking the length of your menstrual cycle and the dates of your periods. The length of a menstrual cycle is typically 28 days, but it can range from 21 to 35 days. Ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day cycle, but this can vary based on the length of your cycle.\n\nUse ovulation predictor kits: These kits are available at pharmacies and can help you predict when you are ovulating by detecting the presence of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. LH surges just before ovulation and can be detected with an ovulation predictor kit.\n\nTrack your basal body temperature: Your basal body temperature is your body's temperature at rest. It tends to rise slightly after ovulation. By taking your temperature every morning before you get out of bed and tracking it over time, you may be able to identify patterns and predict when you are most likely to ovulate.\n\nIt is also important to talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your menstrual cycle and fertility. Your doctor may be able to suggest treatments or medications that can help regulate your menstrual cycle and increase your chances of getting pregnant. For example, the medication Fertyl (clomiphene) is often used to treat infertility in women with irregular periods. However, it is important to use this or any other medication only as directed by a healthcare provider.""]",,medicine,24127
"Is there any safe methods to remove amalgam without side effects ?Hi i believe i have mercury poisoning from my amalgam fillings, i am currently waiting for my blood tests to come in, my question is  if i get  the teeth removed with the amalgam will there be any mercury released in my system from that or  is that a safe method to remove the amalgam without the side effects. i removed 3 amalgams fairly safely with a dentist but i still had terrible side effects.","['thanks for your query, i have gone through your question..the side effects could be because of the amalgam restorations but you can get it removed and restore it with composites..no need to remove the teeth...there are no side effects by removing the amalgam... i hope my answer will help you..take care..']","['Amalgam fillings, also known as silver fillings, contain a mixture of metals including mercury, silver, tin, and copper. There is ongoing debate about the safety of amalgam fillings, with some concerns about the potential health effects of the mercury they contain. However, the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence suggests that amalgam fillings are safe and do not pose a significant health risk when used in dental restorations.\n\nIf you are concerned about the potential health effects of your amalgam fillings and are considering having them removed, it is important to consult with a qualified dental professional. The process of removing amalgam fillings can release small amounts of mercury vapor, which can be inhaled. However, proper safety measures can be taken to minimize the release of mercury vapor during the removal process.\n\nYour dentist should use appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to mercury vapor during the removal process, such as using a high-volume evacuation system to remove the vapor, providing a rubber dam to isolate the tooth being worked on, and using a cold water spray to minimize the release of vapor. In addition, your dentist should provide you with a mouthguard to wear during the procedure to protect your oral tissues and reduce the amount of vapor you inhale.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind that the removal of amalgam fillings carries some risks, such as the possibility of damaging the tooth or surrounding tissues. Therefore, it is important to carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of amalgam removal with your dentist before making a decision.']",,medicine,23378

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that affects the liver, and it can cause a range of symptoms including fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). However, these symptoms are generally not seen until the later stages of the infection, after the virus has caused significant liver damage.\n\nVomiting can be a symptom of many different conditions, including food poisoning, infection, and other underlying medical conditions.

Is IRBBB dangerous?my 11 yr old son was told he has IRBBB. Naturally as parents we are so stressed. He is VERY athletic and loves sports.

Hopefully will get news... but how serious is IRBBB?,"[""Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. IRBBB is Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block. First of all, you need to understand basis of bundle branch to understand IRBBB. There are two bundle branches in heart which transmit the impulse from atria to ventricle. Right and left. Any block in this transmission, can cause problem in transmission of impulse from atria to ventricle and hence ventricle will not function properly. In pediatric patient, most common cause for this is developmental defect. So in your son's case, his right bundle branch is blocked incompletely. So right ventricle is not functioning well. Right ventricle is connected to lungs, so he feels shortness of breath on exertion. Honestly speaking, this is serious health issue and this can worsen with the age. So consult cardiologist as soon as possible for this  IRBBB. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.""]","[""It's understandable that you would be concerned about your son's diagnosis of IRBBB (incomplete right bundle branch block). However, it's important to note that IRBBB is a relatively common finding on an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and is often benign, meaning it is not a serious or life-threatening condition.\n\nIRBBB is a type of heart rhythm abnormality that occurs when the electrical signals that coordinate the contraction of the heart's muscle are disrupted. This can cause the heart to beat less efficiently and may lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. However, many people with IRBBB have no symptoms at all and live normal, active lives.\n\nIt's always important to follow your doctor's recommendations and to have regular check-ups to monitor your son's heart health. In the meantime, it's generally safe for your son to continue participating in sports and other physical activities as long as he feels comfortable doing so. If he experiences any unusual symptoms while exercising, such as shortness of breath or chest pain, he should stop immediately and consult with a doctor.""]",,medicine,23364

It is important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of the tingling and determine the appropriate treatment.\n\nA bicuspid aortic valve is a congenital heart condition in which the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body, has only two leaflets instead of three. This can cause the valve to become narrowed or leaky, leading to heart problems. However, tingling in the legs is not typically a symptom of a bicuspid aortic valve.\n\nIt is possible that the tingling sensation in your leg could be caused by a condition such as peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves that carry messages to and from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by a variety of factors, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and nerve compression. Prolonged sitting can also contribute to the development of peripheral neuropathy, as it can cause decreased blood flow to the legs.\n\nIt is important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of the tingling and determine the appropriate treatment.

But this has short life and a major disadvantage of discoloration. Two, ceramic dental veneers which have to be made in the laboratory and then fixed on the prepared teeth. Ceramic ones are much suitable for you as it can long last and hide the brownish colour of your present teeth to a greater extent but this is expensive than composite ones. Ceramic veneers have different price ranges and it depends on your dentist and the laboratory. Discuss with the your dentist about it and choose your best suited range.']","['It is possible to treat brown teeth due to fluoride staining by professional teeth whitening methods. The most effective method of whitening teeth that have been discolored by fluoride is through in-office bleaching, which is done by a dental professional. This method uses a stronger concentration of bleaching agents and a special light or laser to enhance the whitening process. It is typically more expensive than at-home whitening methods, but it can produce more dramatic results in a shorter period of time.\n\nOther treatment options for brown teeth due to fluoride staining include at-home bleaching kits that use lower concentrations of bleaching agents and take longer to produce results. These kits can be purchased over the counter or from a dental professional, and they generally cost less than in-office bleaching.\n\nIt is important to note that teeth whitening treatments are not permanent, and the results will eventually fade over time. To maintain the whiteness of your teeth, you may need to undergo regular touch-up treatments or use at-home maintenance products, such as whitening toothpaste or mouthwash.\n\nIt is also worth noting that fluoride is an important mineral that helps to protect the teeth from decay. If you are concerned about fluoride staining, you may want to speak with your dental professional about ways to reduce your exposure to fluoride, such as using a toothpaste that is low in fluoride or avoiding drinking water that has high levels of fluoride.']",,medicine,23100

Diaphragm pumps are commonly used in a variety of applications, including chemical processing, water treatment, and medical devices. They are known for their ability to handle abrasive and corrosive fluids, as well as liquids with high viscosities."", 'A diaphragm pump is a type of positive displacement pump that uses a flexible diaphragm to move a fluid.

One chamber is connected to the inlet valve and the other is connected to the outlet valve.\\n\\nThe driving mechanism, which can be an electric motor, a gas engine, or other power source, drives a piston or other mechanism that moves the diaphragm back and forth. As the diaphragm moves, it creates a vacuum in one of the chambers and forces fluid from the inlet valve into the chamber. The inlet valve then closes, and the outlet valve opens, allowing the fluid to be expelled from the pump.\\n\\nDiaphragm pumps are capable of pumping a wide range of fluids, including liquids, gases, and slurries, and can handle high viscosities, abrasive particles, and corrosive fluids. They are commonly used in a variety of applications, including chemical processing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and water treatment.\\n\\nThere are several types of diaphragm pumps, including air-operated diaphragm pumps, hydraulic diaphragm pumps, and mechanical diaphragm pumps.

The fluid is contained in a chamber within the housing, and the diaphragm is positioned between the fluid and the power source.\\n\\nAs the diaphragm is moved back and forth by the power source, it creates alternating pressure and vacuum conditions within the fluid chamber. The pressure changes cause the fluid to flow in and out of the chamber through inlet and outlet valves, which are controlled by the movement of the diaphragm.\\n\\nDiaphragm pumps are widely used in many applications due to their simplicity, reliability, and ability to handle a wide range of fluids, including those that are viscous, abrasive, or hazardous.

What happens to a cucumber or other food when it 's pickled ? How exactly does the vinegar solution pickles are in saturate and preserve them ?

These electrons are accelerated through a tube inside the generator and are then directed towards a metal target, usually made of tungsten. \nAs the high-energy electrons collide with the metal target, they release energy in the form of X-rays. This process is called bremsstrahlung, which means ""braking radiation"" in German. The X-rays produced by the generator are then directed towards the part of the body being examined, and they pass through the body and are captured on film or a digital detector on the other side. \nX-rays are used in many medical and industrial applications because they can pass through most materials and produce images of the inside of objects.

At its core, the conflict is about competing claims to land and sovereignty in the region known as Palestine, which includes the modern state of Israel and the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The conflict has its roots in the late 1800s, when Jewish immigrants began moving to Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire. These immigrants, known as Zionists, believed that Palestine was the ancient homeland of the Jewish people and that they had a right to live there. However, the region was already home to a large Arab population, which opposed the influx of Jewish immigrants and the establishment of a Jewish state. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, the League of Nations granted a mandate to Britain to administer Palestine. The British government encouraged Jewish immigration to Palestine, but also promised to protect the rights of the Arab population. In 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem being designated as an international city. The Jewish community accepted the plan, but the Arab states rejected it and launched a war against the newly established state of Israel. Since then, the conflict has continued, with numerous wars, negotiations, and peace agreements attempted to resolve the dispute. The main issues at stake are control of Jerusalem, the status of Palestinian refugees, the building of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, and the right of Palestinian self-determination. The conflict has also been fueled by religious and cultural differences, as well as political and economic interests. It has caused significant suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians, and has had a major impact on the region and the world.']",426.0,reddit_eli5,2033

What is a computer ' memory leak ' ? I see it 's a huge issue with PC software but have no clue what it means . Can someone kindly explain it to me in simple terms please Explain like I'm five. ,"['Modern operating systems let you run multiple programs at once , but you only have one pool of RAM that they all have to share . The way that works is that when a program wants memory , it asks the operating system for however much it needs , and the OS finds a block that \'s not being used and loans it to the program . When the program is done using the memory , it \'s supposed to return it so other programs can use it . A memory leak happens when a program forgets about a block of memory the operating system gave it . As far as the operating system is concerned , it still has that block "" checked out "" , but the program ca n\'t do anything with it , and it ca n\'t return it back to the operating system because it ca n\'t find it . The memory is n\'t gone permanently- when the program exits , the operating system knows it does n\'t need the memory any more so it marks all the memory that was checked out by the program as "" available "" again . But it \'s not going to be available as long as that program is still running . It \'s only a big problem if the program keeps doing this . If it keeps hitting the code where it asks for more memory , but never returns any of it . Since it \'s not giving any memory back , the program will , over time , consume more and more of your computer \'s memory until you do n\'t have any more memory to give it . At that point , the computer has three choices : 1 . It can start rejecting requests from programs that ask for more memory ( which generally results in those programs crashing ) 2 . It can try storing additional data on the hard drive , which keeps the computer running but is something like 1000x slower than RAM so your computer will slow to a crawl 3 . It can try to figure out which program is stealing all of the memory and terminate that one ( Linux does this , Mac and Windows do n\'t since some programs do n\'t deal well with not having time to clean up ) EDIT : formatting', ""Software developer here , Memory is a finite resource , your computer has only so much of it . Every program needs memory , and it 's use has to be coordinated to ensure no two programs overwrite each other . That coordination typically happens through the OS as the mediator between all other programs and memory . Every program keeps track of what memory addresses it 's using . Typically , when a program needs memory , it will request what it needs , and when it 's done with that memory , it will release it back into the pool of available memory . Most programs , it 's the responsibility of the programmer to allocate and free the memory . Oversights are common , and an algorithm may allocate memory without releasing it when finished . The OS does n't know the program is done with that memory , it does n't know there 's an error that is allocating without releasing memory , and the program error may be such that the program loses track of which bytes it no longer needs , and now it ca n't release it back to the OS . This is a memory leak . The pool of memory is slowly draining .

Explain like I'm five.,"['These explanations are all brutal if you \'re supposed to be actually explaining DX to laymen . I will put everything in point form because I \'m a software engineer and do n\'t believe in wasting my time with stupid crap like grammar , haha . - DirectX is a piece of software ( called an API ) developed by Microsoft for their Windows Operating System - It allows programs on your computer , such as video games , CAD software , etc to access your computer \'s hardware ( such as graphics , sound , keyboard and mouse ) in a very lightweight manner - Very importantly , it allows hardware independence . This means that the same video game will work on every computer without having to be rewritten for every single machine it \'s expected to run on - It is actually composed of a couple of components : Direct3D , DirectShow , DirectSound , DirectInput , and a few more I \'m probably missing . - By far , the most important of these ( and the one MS has sunk the most time and money into ) is Direct3D. - As you may know , everything you see in a 3D video game is made of a bunch of polygons . Even if you see a sphere , it \'s actually made of a bunch of tiny triangles that are so small that they give the illusion of a smooth curve . - Here is an example of Leon from Resident Evil 4 to help you visualize this fact : URL_0 - Direct3D allows video games to say to the 3D graphics hardware , "" Hey man , here are a bunch of triangles and here are instructions on where to put them , what color they should be , what textures they should have , how to light them up , etc "" - DirectSound allows video games to say to the sound card , "" Hey dude , here is a sound wave I want to you play through the speakers at this volume , with this speed , and I want you to mix it with several other sounds "" - A version of DirectX has shipped with Windows ever since Windows 95 , but they were horrible . - Windows XP shipped with DirectX 9 , which was considered to be the first version of DX that did n\'t totally suck . - Ever since then , DirectX 10 came with Vista and DirectX 11 with Windows 7 . - Video games are generally tested with very specific subversions of DirectX , Ex .

How AI technology works in first / third person shooter videogames ? How do AI characters react to your moves in shooter videogames ? Also how do difficulty levels work for AI ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Valve has published a [ slide deck ( PDF ) ] ( URL_0 ) on how they designed the AI for Left 4 Dead . It \'s a bit more on the technical side if that \'s what you \'re interested in . Difficulty levels are just based on how fast the AI reacts and how much error you allow it to have . It \'s really easy to make the "" perfect "" AI because the computer always knows exactly where you are . So to make the game playable , you have to make the AI more stupid- it has to have some random error in its shots and you have to simulate some form of "" vision "" and reaction time or else the bad guys will just snipe you with a hitscan weapon from across the map as soon as the game starts . For a more difficult game , you just turn down the stupid factor .', ""Disclaimer : not an A.I. programmer , but this is my understanding of how you can go about it . There may be better ways to script an A.I. Typically you are programming a series of ' If this Then that ' statements . There can be levels of complexity in how this is done , but it can be generalized somewhat to ' If- > Then ' . For example , lets assume that we have a PlayerChar object that can return its location . We can check if it is in range , aim at it , and fire at that location IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { aimAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; fireAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; } would check if the Player 's Character is within the AI characters ' range ' , ' aim ' at that location , and ' fire ' at that location . You might also program the A.I. to look for cover . Lets assume we have an array that stores nearby objects that are ' cover ' , and can choose randomly from that array to decide where to hide before moving to that location IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { coverArray = searchForCover(me.location ) ; cover = pickRandom(coverArray ) ; moveToLocation(cover.location ) ; IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { aimAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; fireAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; } } Using logical steps in that manner , we could program a very basic enemy A.I. that checks for an enemy in range , looks for cover , moves to cover , and begins to aim and fire at the player . Depending on the complexity of the A.I. these logical steps can get very , very complicated , and have a lot of checks and special logic , e.g A.I. can only detect in a particular cone of view , they can detect sound , vision , they can react to alarms and move to that location , so on and so forth . With difficulty levels , what you might adjust is how well the A.I. reacts . Maybe they have better range , a wider cone of vision , maybe they pick better cover , or are more ' intelligent ' with how they react to your presence . For example , at a lower difficulty , I might allow the A.I. to have more of a delay before searching for cover . But at a higher difficulty , not only will they always run for cover , but they will coordinate with nearby A.I. to lay down alternating fire to keep your character suppressed . With programming an A.I , you usually already have the code for how the ' player ' character works . You now are designing code to do all the things a ' player ' character can do , but automatically based on known inputs ( e.g. the player moves into range , an alarm goes off , an event script tells the A.I. where to go , etc . )"", ""There is really no single answer to this question : shooter video games are not all exactly alike , and even small changes in the game ( available weapon choices , player abilities , common features and motifs in maps ) could require somewhat different behavior from the AI in order to make sense . For example , a shooter with many splash damage weapons would require effective AI to actively try to avoid standing too close to other AI bots , while this would not be a factor in shooters that mostly involve high accuracy , slow firing weapons . Now , this is a gross simplification ( especially since I have limited knowledge of Artificial Intelligence techniques and no knowledge of game - oriented AI ) but a reasonable model for the AI could be a classical State - based representation of the world . State - based representation means that at any given point in time , the algorithm ruling the bot will consider all sorts of various factors ( distance from player , line of sight , player 's equipped weapon , map topography etc ) and use some pre - defined function in order to evaluate the Value of that state ( the higher the value , the more likely the bot will want to be in that state ) . The bot will then evaluate some ( or all ) of its available moves , create many estimates for the possible states that will be created as a result ( and estimate the probability of each hypothetical state ) , and then use another computation ( such as the average state value , or the maximal minimum if the AI wants to minimize risk to itself ) in order to finally select what move to perform . This action is repeated between every two moves the bot performs . It 's not always a very hard computation -- mostly it depends on how many moves deep the algorithm will consider . Having such a system in place , it is possible to tweak the AI 's difficulty level by introducing errors , limiting the amount of moves considered , limiting options at specific instances or even explicitly forcing the algorithm to make sub - optimal choices , say , 5 % of the time . Naturally many , many other types of AIs exist . What I covered is really just a tip of the iceberg .""]","['In a first/third person shooter video game, the AI characters are computer-controlled characters that move and act in the game.

Some games have very basic AI characters that only do a few specific things, while others have more advanced AI characters that can adapt and change their behavior based on what you do.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty level of the game changes how hard it is to defeat the AI characters.

Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi or Kanji in Japanese) are the primary written form of Chinese and have a long history dating back over 3,000 years. They are still used today because they are an important part of Chinese culture and history, and they are also very efficient for written communication. \nOne of the main reasons that Pinyin is not used as the primary written form of Chinese is that it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words. Chinese characters, on the other hand, can convey the full meaning and pronunciation of a word in a single character. For example, the Chinese character for ""water"" is 水, which is pronounced ""shui"" in Mandarin. Pinyin cannot represent the meaning of the character, only the pronunciation. \nAdditionally, replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin as the primary written form of Chinese would be a massive undertaking that would involve changing the way that Chinese is taught in schools, updating dictionaries and other reference materials, and potentially requiring people to learn a new writing system. It would also be difficult to determine a standard way to represent the many different regional accents and dialects of Chinese using the Roman alphabet. \nIn summary, while Pinyin is a useful tool for learning Chinese and transcribing proper nouns, it is not used as the primary written form of Chinese because it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words, and replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin would be a major undertaking.']",,reddit_eli5,1157

Maybe the baby will have a new trait that no one in its family has ever had before. This can happen because of something called a mutation, which is a change in the genes that control how a living thing looks and acts. Mutations can be small, like a change in the color of a flower, or big, like a change in the shape of a beak.\r\n\r\nOver time, living things with traits that help them survive and have babies will have more babies than living things with traits that don't help them survive. This is because the living things with helpful traits are more likely to survive and pass their traits down to their babies.\r\n\r\nSo, over many, many years, the traits of a group of living things can change.

In the game, players can gather resources, craft items, and build structures using blocks of different materials. They can also fight monsters and other creatures, and explore a variety of landscapes, including forests, caves, and oceans. The game is called ""Minecraft"" because it is set in a virtual world made up of blocks, or ""mines,"" that players can mine (dig up) and then use to build whatever they can imagine. There are several different modes in the game, including survival mode, where players must gather resources and fight off monsters to stay alive, and creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and can focus on building and creating. Minecraft is popular with players of all ages because it is easy to learn and allows players to be creative and explore their own virtual world.

This can be a problem because the bone may not heal correctly. When a bone is broken, the body tries to fix it by creating new cells to mend the break. These new cells eventually turn into new bone, which helps the broken bone heal. However, if the bone is not properly aligned while it is healing, it may heal in the wrong position. This can cause the bone to be weaker and more prone to breaking again in the future. It can also cause the joint to not work properly, which can make it difficult to use your hand or wrist. If you think you have broken a bone, it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. The doctor will be able to tell you if you have a broken bone and how to best treat it so that it can heal properly.""]",344.0,reddit_eli5,1951

Some people believe that gun control laws only disarm law-abiding citizens, while criminals will still be able to obtain guns illegally. As a result, they argue that gun control does not actually make people safer. A third argument against gun control is that it can be difficult to enforce. There are already many guns in circulation, and it can be challenging for the government to track and regulate them all. Additionally, some people may be unwilling to comply with gun control laws, making it difficult to effectively enforce them.

The attack led to the United States entering World War II. There were several reasons why the Japanese decided to attack Pearl Harbor. One reason was that Japan was seeking to expand its empire and saw the United States as a potential obstacle to its ambitions. Japan also wanted to secure access to the natural resources of Southeast Asia, and believed that by attacking the United States, it could deter the United States from interfering with its plans. Another reason for the attack was that the United States had imposed economic sanctions on Japan in response to Japan's aggressive actions in China and Southeast Asia. These sanctions, which included a ban on the export of oil and other vital resources to Japan, were hurting Japan's economy and military capabilities. The Japanese government believed that by attacking the United States, it could force the United States to lift these sanctions and give Japan the resources it needed to continue its military expansion.

It is faster than 3G, which is the previous generation of cellular technology. When you are using 4G, you can expect faster internet speeds, which means that websites will load more quickly and you will be able to download and stream video and other content more smoothly.\n\nOne reason that 4G may be faster than WiFi is because it uses a different type of connection. WiFi is a wireless internet connection that relies on a router or other device to connect to the internet, while 4G is a cellular connection that uses a network of towers and antennas to connect to the internet. This means that 4G can be faster in some cases, especially if you are in an area with a strong 4G signal.\n\nIt's also possible that you are experiencing faster speeds with 4G because the network is less congested. When a lot of people are using the same WiFi network, it can slow down the connection for everyone. With 4G, you are connected to a specific tower and antenna, so there is less competition for bandwidth.\n\nOverall, 4G is a faster and more reliable way to connect to the internet, especially if you are in an area with a strong 4G signal. It is particularly useful for people who use their phones or other devices to do a lot of online activities, such as streaming video, downloading music, or playing online games.""]",,reddit_eli5,14958
How does hydrogen turn into people ? I know you 've heard the quote -- I saw fourteen of you use it today . But how ? What 's the chain of events that begins with hydrogen and ends with people ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Stars are bright and hot because in their cores they have nuclear fusion going on . Nuclear Fusion is when small elements are crunched together ( fused ) to form larger elements . Depending on the star , different atoms will be combined to create different elements . Some stars convert hydrogen into helium . Other stars convert helium into relatively light elements ( like oxygen and carbon ) , and still other stars ( usually very large stars that are in the process of dying ) create heavier elements like gold and uranium . Some stars will explode when they die , spilling a chunk of their constructed elements out into the universe . These elements might form into other stars ( creating more heavy elements ) or they might form into planets . Now , what about your body ? Your body is made up of cells , which are made up of molecules , which are made up of elements . Since you * are n't * made up of entirely hydrogen , every element in your body must have at some point been formed by a star . So hydrogen turns into people , but in a kind of roundabout way . First hydrogen has to turn into helium ( in a star ) , then the helium has to turn into even heavier elements ( also in a star ) , then the heavier elements need to turn into a planet ( after the star explodes ) , then that planet has to produce life ( through abiogenesis(we're actually not quite sure how this specifically happened on earth ) ) , and then that life has to turn into people ( through evolution ) ."", 'It \'s a pretty terrible quote , frankly . But there are two important things you need to know about to understand this : baryogenesis and nucleosynthesis . Settle down , I \'m gon na explain them . You \'ve heard of protons , yeah ? Protons are one of the three particles that atoms are made of . Protons are particles called * baryons * ; a protons is one type of baryon . There \'s another type of baryon that \'s also important : It \'s called a neutron . There are about a * zillion * other types of baryons that * are n\'t * important to us right now , but take all of these things collectively and we call them baryons . Baryons are not elementary things . That is , they \'re things which are made of other things . What are they made of ? A variety of particles that are called * quarks . * The question , then , is how did quarks * initially * get together to make baryons ? Or in other words , how did the first baryons come to exist ? The answer is the Big Bang . The Big Bang was the earliest period in the history of the universe , lasting from * zero * — what we call the time of the very first event that ever happened — to about 400,000 years later . Early on in the Big Bang , the universe was very hot and dense , so hot and dense that no matter could exist . Later , as the universe cooled , the first quarks appeared . But it turns out quarks , by themselves , are not stable , for deep and complicated reasons we wo n\'t go into here . Below a certain energy density , quarks are only stable when they link up in pairs and in threes . So as the universe cooled , those first primordial quarks did just that : They hooked up in pairs and in threes . The pairs we call mesons and we do n\'t care about them right now ; the three - particle collections of quarks we call * baryons * , and the proton is the lightest of all the baryons . But when the quarks first congealed into baryons , the result was both baryons and * antibaryons * . You know , like antimatter ? When a baryon of one type encounters an antibaryon of another type , the two particles annihilate each other , meaning they cancel each other out and release photons . When a * heavy * baryon and a heavy antibaryon get together , they release * very energetic * photons . Very energetic photons do n\'t want to stay photons any more ; they want to decay into lighter particles . We call these lighter particles * leptons * . The electron , which you \'ve doubtless heard of , is a lepton . So let \'s review what we \'ve got so far : First the universe was very hot . As it cooled , quarks appeared . As it cooled further , quarks hooked up in pairs and triplets to form mesons and baryons and their antiparticles . But the mesons and baryons and their antiparticles all got together and mutually annihilated , releasing energetic photons which decayed into electrons . That \'s how both protons and electrons first came into existence . Of course , that raises the question : If all the baryons got together with all the antibaryons and annihilated to make photons and leptons … how come there are still baryons in the universe ? I mean , we \'re * surrounded * by atoms made of protons and neutrons , and those are baryons , so how \'d they get here ? The answer is called * baryon asymmetry * . See , way back when the free quarks first condensed into baryons and antibaryons , for every ten billion antibaryons that formed , ten billion * and one * baryons formed . So when all the annihilation happened , we had one baryon in ten billion left over with no partner to annihilate with . So those particles stayed around , and that \'s the origin of all the baryonic matter in the universe today . Why did that baryon asymmetry exist ? Nobody knows for sure . We already know about processes in nature that slightly favor baryons over antibaryons , so we know it \'s possible for that asymmetry to exist . But its precise nature is gon na remain a mystery for a while yet . Anyway , there we are , a bit after the start of the Big Bang . Quarks appeared , hooked up to make baryons , baryons annihilated releasing leptons and a * very slight * trace of leftover baryons . Meaning we had a universe that was filled with a hot gas of mostly protons and electrons and basically nothing else . As this gas cooled , the protons — which have positive electric charge — and the electrons — negative electric charge — got together . You know what you get when you put a proton and an electron together , do n\'t you ? You get * hydrogen . * That \'s how hydrogen came to exist : The universe cooled , and all those free protons and electrons hooked up . So the universe went from being filled with a hot electron - proton plasma to a merely warm ( a few thousand degrees ) neutral hydrogen gas . Well , this hydrogen gas was n\'t perfectly evenly distributed . It was denser in some places than in others . In places where it was denser , gravity started to pull the gas together to make it denser still . Once enough hydrogen gas gets together , a process called * nuclear fusion * can happen . Basically , if you squish two hydrogen nuclei — protons , in other words — together , they \'ll * stick * and make a helium nucleus . And if you stick two heliums together you get a beryllium , which is unstable and decays into a lithium … and so on . The trick is , none of these reactions can happen unless the hydrogen gas is really hot and really dense , which means you need a lot of it in one place . It took a few million years for this to happen , but once it did , you got * stars . * Stars are where * nucleosynthesis * happens . You start with hydrogen and smoosh the nuclei together to make bigger nuclei , then smoosh those nuclei together to make still bigger nuclei … then the star explodes . Because those first stars that existed did n\'t live very long . They were really inefficient , so once they got to a point where they could n\'t support themselves by fusing hydrogen into helium , they popped like balloons and scattered their contents through space . Which meant now you had this big clouds of hydrogen * and helium * , which again started to collapse under their own weight and turned into the next generation of stars . These fused the heavier stuff inside them into still heavier stuff , then popped and scattered their fusion products through space , products like carbon and nitrogen and oxygen . These subsequent clouds collapsed again and formed stars … but that \'s not all . Those clouds also congealed to form things smaller than stars , made up of heavier elements that had n\'t been present in the universe before , elements like iron and nickel and silicon , plus in at least one case a lot of leftover hydrogen that bonded with oxygen . We call these smaller things * planets * and the leftover - hydrogen - plus - oxygen * water * . And then one of those planets ended up having people on it . So yes , in a sense hydrogen turned into people , first through the process of baryogenesis — where hydrogen appeared for the first time in the universe — and then through nucleosynthesis — where hydrogen got smooshed together to make more interesting things inside the cores of about three generations of stars and about ten billion years . But just saying that "" hydrogen turns into people "" somehow manages to throw away all the * interesting * stuff and leave just one mundane , totally uninteresting fact that \'s sort - of true but not really .', ""Our sun is in it 's second life cycle , and is in the region of 4.5 billion years old . Before this , a much bigger star , made of 99.9 % hydrogen a little helium and a pinch of lithium ( all residue from the big bang , ) was floating around in space somewhere . This star had enough gravity in its core to fuse hydrogen in to larger heavier atoms like oxygen , carbon , iron and everything else that makes up the earth . Being so big , this star went into supernova . Basically it exploded , spewing all these heavy atoms out into nowhere . Thicker parts of this cloud of atoms started to gravitate towards each other , slowly clumping together , getting hotter and increasing its gravitational pull . As this clump grew in mass , it began the process of nuclear fusion again . The birth of a second , much smaller star from what was left of the first . Now , still spewed around this young star is all the thinner regions of the cloud of atoms . The gravity of the star , combined with centrifugal ( spinning ) force , began swirling the cloud into orbit around the star . The cloud , little by little , got thicker in places where all these atoms started clumping together . By centrifugal force and the even pull of gravity , these clumps were shaped into spheres , and became planets . Those closer to the sun are mostly made of dense iron - being heavier it was pulled closer by the new star - and those farther away are made from light , less dense gasses . In the earth 's case , a large body of molten iron was surrounded by a thin cover of mostly hydrogen and helium . As the earth began to cool , forming the crust , volcanoes were erupting intensely over the surface , spilling forth water vapour , carbon dioxide , methane and ammonia . A bit more cooling and bodies of water started to form , early oceans that were void of oxygen . The earth was in this state 3.5 - 4 billion years ago . Through electrical activity ( lightening ) , and the combining of early atmosphere gasses with the new oceans , and the odd atom of phosphorous that was kicking around , the first few basic building blocks of life were created . This pre - biotic soup , as it is known , consisted of a few amino acids and a couple of RNA bases . Add a few hundred million years , a few of these building blocks had formed into self - replicating molecules . A few of these molecules became bound together in an enclosed membrane , complete with instructions for copying itself , and life began . These very early bacteria - formed around 3 billion years ago - was the starting point for every living this on earth . Basic biological and biochemical processes were worked out . 2.7 - 2.2 billion years ago , the most important of biological process was worked out - photosynthesis . Suddenly , bacteria could create energy rich molecules using abundant CO2 and sunlight . But more importantly , they started mass producing oxygen . Oxygen changed everything . Much more energy was utilised when respiring with oxygen , and that meant life could replicate and diversify much much quicker . Bacteria started compartmentalizing regions of there cells , increasing efficiency . Some cells started collaborating , increasing survival , and some of these multi - celled organisms developed specialized regions , allowing them to out compete others . The rest came down to survival of the fittest , with the most diversified most likely to reproduce and pass on those characteristics . Add another billion years or so , and that led to you .""]","[""Hydrogen doesn't turn into people directly. However, hydrogen is an important part of the process that allows living things, including people, to exist. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and it is found in many different places, including the sun and other stars. The sun is a giant ball of gas that is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, and it gives off light and heat. This light and heat are what allow life to exist on Earth. On Earth, plants use the energy from the sun to turn carbon dioxide and water into food through a process called photosynthesis. When plants make food, they use the energy from the sun to combine hydrogen and oxygen atoms from water molecules to form glucose, which is a type of sugar. Glucose is a source of energy for plants, and it is also a source of energy for animals that eat plants. So, in a way, hydrogen is an important part of the process that allows living things, including people, to exist because it is used by plants to make food. When animals eat plants, they get the energy from the food that the plants made using hydrogen, and that energy is used to fuel their bodies and keep them alive.""]",638.0,reddit_eli5,2245

The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of ""intelligent"" global behavior, unknown to the individual agents. Examples of swarm intelligence in natural systems include ant colonies, bee colonies, bird flocking, hawks hunting, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.\nThe application of swarm principles to robots is called swarm robotics while swarm intelligence refers to the more general set of algorithms.

In the same way that the RAM is used by sequential-algorithm designers to model algorithmic performance (such as time complexity), the PRAM is used by parallel-algorithm designers to model parallel algorithmic performance (such as time complexity, where the number of processors assumed is typically also stated). Similar to the way in which the RAM model neglects practical issues, such as access time to cache memory versus main memory, the PRAM model neglects such issues as synchronization and communication, but provides any (problem-size-dependent) number of processors.

"Please explain what is ""Jerry Fodor""","['Jerry Alan Fodor (/ˈfoʊdər/; April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and the author of many crucial works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science. His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had ""an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960."" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.\nFodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation.[citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.\nFor Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or ""organs"", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the ""central processing"" part of the mind, which has a more global and less ""domain specific"" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.:\u200a73–75\u200a\nAlthough Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.']","['Jerry Fodor was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist.

This view holds that the mind is composed of a number of independent systems or modules, each of which is specialized for processing a particular type of information. Fodor argued that these modules are innate and dedicated to specific tasks, such as perception, language, and reasoning. He also proposed that mental states are individuated by their causal roles, which he called ""functional roles.""\n\n\n\nFodor was also a leading figure in the development of the theory of computationalism, which holds that the mind is a computational system and that mental processes can be understood in terms of computations.

From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, ""flocking"" is the collective motion by a group of self-propelled entities and is a collective animal behaviour exhibited by many living beings such as birds, fish, bacteria, and  insects. It is considered an emergent behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.']","['Flocking is a type of coordinated group behavior that is exhibited by animals of various species, including birds, fish, and insects.

For example, flocking birds may be able to locate food more efficiently or defend themselves against predators more effectively when they work together. Flocking behavior is also thought to help animals stay together and maintain social bonds.\n\n\n\nThere are several different models that have been proposed to explain the mechanisms behind flocking behavior. One of the most well-known models is the ""boids"" model, which was developed by computer graphics researcher Craig Reynolds in 1986.

The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. \nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel\'s Checker\'s Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant\'s PAC learning, Quinlan\'s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]\nNeural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt\'s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn\'t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]']","['Symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and logic-based methods to solve problems. It is also sometimes referred to as ""classical AI"" or ""good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI).""\n\n\n\nIn symbolic AI, problems are solved by manipulating symbols according to a set of rules. The symbols represent concepts or entities in the problem domain, and the rules represent the relationships between those concepts or entities. For example, a symbolic AI system might be designed to solve a puzzle by representing the different pieces of the puzzle as symbols and using rules to manipulate those symbols and find a solution.\n\n\n\nSymbolic AI systems are often based on first-order logic, which allows them to represent and reason about the properties of objects and the relationships between them. This makes them well-suited for tasks that require logical reasoning and problem-solving, such as natural language processing, planning, and theorem proving.\n\n\n\nHowever, symbolic AI systems have some limitations. They can be difficult to design and implement, and they may require a large amount of human-generated knowledge to be encoded into the system. In addition, they can be inflexible and may not be able to handle uncertainty or handle tasks that require a lot of data or sensory input.\n\n\n\nToday, symbolic AI is often used in combination with other AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, in order to improve their performance and overcome some of their limitations.']",,wiki_csai,18317

"Please explain what is ""Technological singularity""","['The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I.J. Good\'s intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.\nThe first person to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\nThe concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to ""the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole"", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\'s 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction.[10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\nProminent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.[12] One claim made was that the artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.']","['The technological singularity is a hypothetical future event that is associated with the creation of superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI).

This could potentially lead to the development of technologies and capabilities that are far beyond our current understanding, such as advanced nanotechnology, mind uploading, or even the creation of artificial life forms.\n\n\n\nThere is significant debate among experts as to whether or not the singularity will actually occur, and if it does, what the consequences might be. Some argue that the singularity could bring great benefits, such as solving many of the world\'s problems and enhancing human life in ways that we can\'t currently imagine. Others are more skeptical, and argue that the singularity could bring unintended consequences, such as the potential for the AI to become a threat to humanity, or the creation of an unequal society in which the superintelligent AI and its creators hold disproportionate power and influence.']",,wiki_csai,19021

The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers, and include algebraic numbers (such as the square root √2 = 1.414...) and transcendental numbers (such as π = 3.1415...).\nReal numbers can be thought of as all points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.\nConversely, analytic geometry is the association of points on lines (especially axis lines) to real numbers such that geometric displacements are proportional to differences between corresponding numbers.\nThe informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field.[d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations.

In competitive learning, the neurons in the network compete with each other to classify the input. This is typically done by having each neuron in the network receive input from the previous layer, and then the neuron with the highest activation (i.e., the one that is most strongly activated by the input) wins the competition and is allowed to pass its activation to the next layer of the network. The weights of the connections between the neurons are adjusted in order to optimize the network's ability to classify the input.\n\n\n\nCompetitive learning is often used in self-organizing maps, which are neural networks that are trained to project high-dimensional input data onto a lower-dimensional output space in a way that preserves the topological structure of the data. This allows the network to learn to cluster the data and classify it based on its topological relationships.\n\n\n\nOverall, competitive learning is a useful tool for training artificial neural networks to classify inputs, and it is often used in combination with other learning algorithms in order to improve the performance of the network.""]",,wiki_csai,18450

DBNs were developed by Paul Dagum in the early 1990s at Stanford University's Section on Medical Informatics. Dagum developed DBNs to unify and extend traditional linear state-space models such as Kalman filters, linear and normal forecasting models such as ARMA and simple dependency models such as hidden Markov models into a general probabilistic representation and inference mechanism for arbitrary nonlinear and non-normal time-dependent domains.\nToday, DBNs are common in robotics, and have shown potential for a wide range of data mining applications.  For example, they have been used in speech recognition, digital forensics, protein sequencing, and bioinformatics.

"Please explain what is ""Computational complexity""","['In computer science, the computational complexity or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it. Particular focus is given to computation time (generally measured by the number of needed elementary operations) and memory storage requirements. The complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow solving the problem.\nThe study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called analysis of algorithms, while the study of the complexity of problems is called computational complexity theory. Both areas are highly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound on the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm. Moreover, for designing efficient algorithms, it is often fundamental to compare the complexity of a specific algorithm to the complexity of the problem to be solved. Also, in most cases, the only thing that is known about the complexity of a problem is that it is lower than the complexity of the most efficient known algorithms. Therefore, there is a large overlap between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. \nAs the amount of resources required to run an algorithm generally varies with the size of the input, the complexity is typically expressed as a function n → f(n), where n is the size of the input and f(n) is either the worst-case complexity (the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed over all inputs of size n) or the average-case complexity (the average of the amount of resources over all inputs of size n). Time complexity is generally expressed as the number of required elementary operations on an input of size n, where elementary operations are assumed to take a constant amount of time on a given computer and change only by a constant factor when run on a different computer. Space complexity is generally expressed as the amount of memory required by an algorithm on an input of size n.']","['Computational complexity is a field of computer science that studies the amount of resources (such as time and space) required to solve problems using algorithms.

"Please explain what is ""Approximate computing""","['Approximate computing is an emerging paradigm for energy-efficient and/or high-performance design. It includes a plethora of computation techniques that return a possibly inaccurate result rather than a guaranteed accurate result, and that can be used for applications where an approximate result is sufficient for its purpose.

Similarly, occasional dropping of some frames in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing bounded approximation can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy.[clarification needed]  For example, in k-means clustering algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification.\nThe key requirement in approximate computing is that approximation can be introduced only in non-critical data, since approximating critical data (e.g., control operations) can lead to disastrous consequences, such as program crash or erroneous output.']","['Approximate computing is a computing paradigm that involves intentionally introducing errors or uncertainty into computing systems in order to reduce resource consumption or improve performance.

At the hardware level, approximate computing can involve the use of low-precision or error-prone components in order to reduce power consumption or increase the speed of computation.
