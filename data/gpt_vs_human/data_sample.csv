If I want a Credit Card offered through a different Credit Union should I slowly transition my banking to that CU?,"As has been stated, you don't need to actively bank with a credit union to apply for one of their credit cards. That said, one benefit to having account activity, and significant capital with a CU, is to increase the likelihood of having a larger credit line granted to you, when you do apply. If you are going to use the card sparingly however, then this is a non issue. That said, if you really want to maximize card benefits, then you want to look for cards with large sign up bonuses (e.g. Chase Sapphire, or Ink Bold if you have a business) and sign up exclusively for those bonuses. These cards offer rewards in excessive value of $1000 in travel services (hotels/plane tickets), or $500 cash back if you prefer straight cash back redemptions. If you prefer to keep it really simple, you can sign up for a cash back card, like the Amex Fidelity, which offers 2% cash back everywhere, with no annual fee (albeit the cash back is through their investment account, which you don't actually have to 'invest' with). Personally, I have the Penfed card, and use it exclusively for gas (5% cash back). I also have a Charles Schwab bank account, which I keep funded exclusively for ATM withdrawals (free ATM usage, worldwide, 100% fee reimbursement). I use the accounts exclusively for the benefit they provide me, and no more and have never had an issue. I also have 3 dozen other credit cards which I signed up for exclusively for the sign up bonus, but that's outside the scope of this question. I only mention it because you seem to believe it is difficult to get approved for a new credit line. If your credit is good however, you won't have a problem.  For a small idea, of how to maximize credit card bonus categories, I would advise you read this. As mentioned in the article, its possible to get rewards almost everywhere you shop. In short, anytime you use cash, you are missing out on a multitude of benefits a credit card offers you (e.g. see the benefits of a visa signature card) in addition to points/cash back.","It is generally a good idea to gradually transition your banking to a new credit union if you are planning on applying for a credit card with that credit union. This is because the credit union will likely consider your banking history with them when deciding whether to approve your credit card application. Additionally, moving all of your banking at once can be time-consuming and may cause disruptions to your finances.Here are some steps you can follow to gradually transition your banking to a new credit union:Research credit unions: Look for credit unions that offer credit cards and compare their fees, interest rates, and other terms and conditions.Open a checking account: Start by opening a checking account with the credit union. This will allow you to deposit your paychecks and pay bills directly from the account.Set up automatic payments: Consider setting up automatic payments for your bills, such as your rent or mortgage, utilities, and other recurring expenses. This will help ensure that you don't miss any payments while you are transitioning your banking.Transfer your direct deposit: If you receive your paycheck via direct deposit, ask your employer to redirect your deposit to your new credit union account.Close your old accounts: Once you feel comfortable using your new credit union account and have transferred all of your automatic payments and direct deposits, you can close your old accounts. Make sure to cancel any automatic payments or direct deposits that are still going to your old account.By following these steps, you can smoothly transition your banking to a new credit union and be in a better position to apply for a credit card with them.",,finance,19513
Why would a company sell debt in order to buy back shares and/or pay dividends?,"Businesses have bond ratings just like people have credit ratings. It has become common for businesses to issue low rate bonds to show that they are strong, and leave the door open for further borrowing if they see an opportunity, such as an acquisition.  One of the reasons Microsoft might want to build a credit reputation, is that people become familiar with their bonds and will purchase at lower rates when they want to borrow larger amounts of money, rather than assuming they are having financial issues which would lead them to demand higher rates.","There are several reasons why a company might choose to sell debt in order to buy back shares and/or pay dividends:Capital structure optimization: By selling debt, a company can raise capital without diluting the ownership of its existing shareholders. This can be particularly appealing if the company's shares are undervalued, as it allows the company to buy back shares at a lower price and potentially improve its earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE).Share buybacks: A company might use the proceeds from debt issuance to buy back its own shares. This can help reduce the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares. Share buybacks can also signal to the market that the company believes its shares are undervalued.Dividends: A company might also use the proceeds from debt issuance to pay dividends to its shareholders. This can be a way to distribute profits to shareholders and return value to them.It's worth noting that selling debt to finance share buybacks and dividends can be risky, as it can increase the company's financial leverage and leave it vulnerable to changes in interest rates or a downturn in its business. Companies should carefully consider their financial position and the risks associated with taking on additional debt before making this decision.",,finance,19640
My employer doesn't provide an electronic pay stub and I need one to get a car loan,"You have a few options and sometimes challenges help us improve our situation. First, you can not borrow to buy a car.  Reducing the massive depreciation that cars undergo will help you be wealthier.  It is hard to find a good use car that you can buy for cash, but it will play out best for your finances in the long run. If your heart is set on borrowing, I would encourage you to go to the bank/credit union where you have your checking account.  They will see your history of deposits and may grant you a loan based on that.  Also you are likely to get a better deal from the bank than from the car dealer. Thirdly, you can simply go to your employer's HR department and ask them.  Surely someone has applied for a loan during the company's history.  What did they do for them?","It's not uncommon for employers to provide pay stubs electronically these days, as it can be more convenient and efficient for both the employer and the employee. If your employer is not providing electronic pay stubs, there are a few options you can consider:Ask your employer if they can provide you with an electronic pay stub. They may be able to do this through their payroll system or by emailing you a copy of your pay stub.If your employer is unable or unwilling to provide an electronic pay stub, you may be able to request a physical copy of your pay stub from your employer.If you are unable to obtain a pay stub from your employer, you may be able to provide other documentation to your lender, such as a bank statement or a letter from your employer outlining your salary and pay frequency.It's important to note that different lenders may have different requirements for documentation, so it's a good idea to check with your lender to see what they need in order to consider your loan application.",,finance,22413
When does a pricing error become false advertising?,"It's definitely annoying, but it's not necessarily false advertising. There is no rule or law that says they have to fix a pricing error at all, let alone within a certain period of time. Unfortunately they have no obligation to do business with you unless they take (and keep) your money. If they canceled the order and returned your money you have no binding agreement with them.  On top of that, in the US... 'misleading advertising' usually refers to ""Any advertising or promotion that misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities or geographic origin of goods, services or commercial activities"" (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(a)). The main criteria that they evaluate before taking legal action is whether or not someone has suffered harm or loss due to the reliance on the bad information. But you're in Europe. The EU ideas behind misleading advertising tend to focus a lot more on comparing one product to someone else's and making subjective claims or false promises. Pricing does come up, but still, you need to have an ability to prove that you suffered harm or a loss from the business' actions.  Even if you were able to prove that, to force the business to change its price catalog, you would need to go through legal proceedings, demonstrate the harm that you've sustained, and then have a judge decide in your favor and order the supplier to comply. My guess is that it's just not worth it for you, but you haven't specified if this is just an annoying shoe-shopping experience or if you are regularly experiencing bait-and-switch tactics from a supplier that is a crucial part of a business operation.  If it's the former, just like a physical shop reserves the right to kick you out if you're not behaving, (but usually doesn't because they'd like to keep you as a customer), an online shop can update its prices whenever they like. They can change their prices too, and cancel orders.  If it's the latter, then start putting together some documentation on how many times this has happened and how it has damaged your business. But before you get on the warpath I would recommend you look for another place to buy whatever you have in mind, or else try a pound of sugar in your approach to this supplier... My own business experience has shown that can go a lot way in figuring out a mutually beneficial resolution. If you want to see a bit more...  Here is the EU Justice Commission's website on false advertising, Here is a PDF leaflet from the UK Office of Fair Trading that spells out what is explicitly not allowed from a business by way of advertising & business practices.","Pricing errors can sometimes be considered false advertising if they are made intentionally or if they are made in a way that is likely to mislead consumers. False advertising is a form of deceptive business practice that involves making false or misleading statements about a product or service in order to persuade consumers to purchase it.Under federal law in the United States, false advertising is prohibited by the Federal Trade Commission Act. This law applies to all forms of advertising, including television, radio, print, and online advertising.In order for a pricing error to be considered false advertising, it must be shown that the error was made with the intent to deceive or mislead consumers. If a pricing error is made unintentionally or due to a mistake, it is not considered false advertising. However, if the error is not promptly corrected or if the business continues to advertise the incorrect price after becoming aware of the error, it may be considered false advertising.In general, businesses have a legal obligation to be truthful and accurate in their advertising, and they can be held liable for false or deceptive advertising practices. If you believe that a business has engaged in false advertising, you can report it to the appropriate regulatory agency, such as the Federal Trade Commission in the United States.",,finance,20670
Minimizing loss during two-way currency transfers involving foreign entities,"The solution was to get a foreign bank in each country we do business in. Get a credit card processor there, and simply make our money and keep our money in that country, and taking quarterly gains from those accounts and bringing them to the US account.","There are several steps you can take to minimize loss during two-way currency transfers involving foreign entities:Use a reputable foreign exchange provider: It's important to choose a foreign exchange provider that offers competitive exchange rates and low fees. This can help you get the most value for your money.Monitor exchange rates: Keep an eye on exchange rates and try to transfer money when the rate is favorable for you. You can use tools like Google Finance or Yahoo Finance to track exchange rates.Use a forward contract: A forward contract allows you to lock in an exchange rate for a future currency transfer. This can be useful if you expect the exchange rate to change significantly between now and the time of your transfer.Consider using a multi-currency account: If you frequently transfer money between different currencies, you may want to consider opening a multi-currency account. This allows you to hold and manage multiple currencies in a single account, which can make it easier to transfer money between them.Use a credit card: If you're making a large purchase in a foreign currency, using a credit card can be a good option. Many credit cards offer favorable exchange rates and may also provide additional protections like fraud protection and purchase protection.Remember, it's always a good idea to do your research and compare different options before making a currency transfer. This can help you find the best solution for your needs and minimize any potential losses.",,finance,21798
In-laws moving in (financial/tax implications)?,"You are ""pool[ing] the sales from both houses as downpayment on the new house."" But they are going to pay you rent.  Your question as it stands, just opens more questions. What, exactly is the ownership of the new house? If your's (and your wife's) was the money a gift?  Ignoring the gift, if that's what it is, and if the in-law suite is 25% of the house value, you have a rental. You claim 25% of the expenses, including property tax and mortgage interest, along with 25% of the utilities, unless their part has its own meters.  That's a start, if you add details, I may edit my answer. (Not to be pedantic, but whose parents are they. They can't be ""our in-laws,"" can they?)","There are several financial and tax implications to consider when your in-laws move in with you. Here are a few potential issues to consider:Mortgage and property taxes: If you own your home, you may see an increase in your mortgage payments if you take on a roommate, as it could affect your debt-to-income ratio and potentially your mortgage interest rate. Additionally, if you live in a state with property taxes, you may see an increase in your property tax bill if the value of your home increases due to the additional occupants.Rent: If you rent your home, you may need to pay additional rent to cover the cost of your in-laws living with you. Be sure to check your lease to see if adding additional occupants is allowed, and if so, whether you need to pay any additional fees.Taxes: If you receive rental income from your in-laws, you will need to report this income on your tax return. You may also be able to claim some of the expenses related to renting out a room, such as a portion of your mortgage interest or property taxes, as a tax deduction.Insurance: You may need to update your insurance policies to reflect the additional occupants in your home. This could include adding your in-laws to your home insurance policy or increasing your liability coverage.Estate planning: If you have a will, you may want to update it to reflect the fact that your in-laws are living with you. This can help ensure that your assets are distributed according to your wishes if something were to happen to you.It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to help you understand the financial and tax implications of your in-laws moving in and to ensure that you are prepared for any potential issues that may arise.",,finance,19343
How can I get a mortgage I can't afford?,You can ask the buyer to lower the price by the amount you are approved for and negation transferring the amount to him via a escrow..,"It is generally not a good idea to get a mortgage that you cannot afford. If you take out a mortgage that is too large for you to comfortably make the monthly payments, you may struggle to keep up with your payments and could end up defaulting on the loan. This can have serious negative consequences, including damage to your credit score, the loss of your home, and legal action against you.If you are having difficulty affording a mortgage, there are several things you can try:Shop around for the best mortgage rates and terms. Different lenders may offer different rates and terms, and you may be able to find a mortgage that is more affordable for you.Consider a shorter loan term. A shorter loan term means higher monthly payments, but you will pay off the loan faster and pay less in interest over the life of the loan.Try to reduce your other expenses. Look for ways to cut costs, such as by reducing your monthly bills or finding a cheaper place to live.Consider getting a roommate or renting out a room to help cover your mortgage payments.Consult with a financial advisor or housing counselor to get advice on how to manage your finances and find an affordable mortgage.In general, it is important to carefully consider your financial situation before taking out a mortgage, and to make sure that you can afford the monthly payments.",,finance,20954
Questioning my Realtor,"even though they're only asking for 1/2 the money and have excellent credit that the mortgage company may not lend it to them if I'm over priced Yes. If the house's value, as determined by the appraisal, is less than the sale price, the bank will not finance the loan. Appraisals and the appraisal process have become much tighter since the Frannie and Freddie debacle. This fact is true regardless of amounts or credit history. Though this is happens somewhat rarely; typically if a seller and buyer agree to a price, this price is a reasonable value -- after all, that is nearly the definition of ""market value"". So, yes, it is true (and always true, for any financed purchase), but that shouldn't really affect your decision. If you try to sell for more than the appraisal, you will just lower the price to the appraised amount.","If you have questions about your real estate agent or the process of buying or selling a home, it's important to communicate with them directly. Your real estate agent should be able to answer any questions you have and provide you with the information you need to make informed decisions.

You can also consider seeking the advice of a real estate attorney or contacting your local real estate association for guidance.",,finance,21144
Can you recommend some good websites/brokers for buying/selling stocks in India? ,Most of the Indian Brokers started offering API's to retail client these days.

Currently two levels of API are offered. 1)Semi-automatic or one touch trading (Retail Traders) 2)Fully Automatic ( Dealers) I had tested the API with a discount broker www.tradejini.com and it is good at retail level. But to make your trading systems fully automatic you need to pass NISM Series VIII certification (Dealer Certification) and have to take dealer terminals from the broker.

incorrect printed information on check stock,"Probably a bad assumption, but I'm assuming your in the United States. Keep in mind, that the check number is printed in 2 places on the front of each check. First, in the upper right corner, and also along the bottom edge on of the check. Since the check number is scanned by the bank from the bottom edge of the check, covering or otherwise modifying the check number on the upper left corner will have no effect on the check number that is recorded when the check is processed. And, you can't modify or cover the numbers or place any marks in the area of the numbers along the bottom of the check as this will likely interfere with processing of checks. So, modifying the check numbers will not work. Your choices are basically to:   The check numbers are not used in any way in clearing the check, the numbers are only for your convenience, so processing checks with duplicate numbers won't matter.  The check numbers are recorded when processed at your bank so they can be shown on your printed and online statements. The only time the check number might be important is if you had to ""stop payment"" on a particular check, or otherwise inquire about a particular check. But this should not really be an issue because by the time you have used up the first batch of checks, and start using the checks with duplicate numbers, the first use of the early duplicate numbered checks will be sufficiently long ago that there should not be any chance of processing checks with duplicate numbers at the same time. You didn't mention how many checks you have with duplicate numbers, or how frequently you actually write checks so that may play a part in your decision. In my case, 100 checks will last me literally years, so it wouldn't be a problem for me.","If you have received check stock with incorrect information printed on it, you should contact the company or individual that provided the check stock as soon as possible. They will be able to assist you in obtaining new check stock with the correct information. It is important to resolve this issue as soon as possible, as using checks with incorrect information can cause problems when you try to use them.

"Paid cash for a car, but dealer wants to change price",If the discount is only for financed car then their software application should have accepted the payment (electronic transfer ID) from financed bank.

How do 401k handle rate of return,"A 401(k) is an investment just like any other investment. You generally get two types of return lumped into that number, but there can be more and you should read your funds prospectus carefully. If you aren't investing in direct companies, you're using mutual funds for instance, then you should read the funds prospectus to see how they handle these situations for the underlying securities they hold for you. Although I think this is the basic answer to the question as you asked.","A 401(k) is a type of retirement savings plan offered by many employers to their employees. The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary to a tax-deferred account, which means that the employee does not pay taxes on the money they contribute or on the investment earnings until they withdraw the money in retirement.The rate of return on a 401(k) refers to the amount of money that an employee's investments have earned over a certain period of time. This rate of return is determined by the performance of the individual investments that make up the employee's 401(k) portfolio, which may include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other types of investments.The rate of return on a 401(k) can vary widely depending on the specific investments that an employee has chosen, as well as market conditions and other factors. Some employees may choose to invest in more conservative investments that offer a lower but more stable rate of return, while others may choose to invest in riskier investments that have the potential for higher returns but also come with a higher level of risk.Employees can typically manage their 401(k) investments by choosing from a selection of investment options offered by their employer or the plan administrator. Some plans may offer professional investment management services for an additional fee, or allow employees to choose their own investments within certain guidelines. It's important for employees to understand the risks and potential returns of the investment options available in their 401(k) plan and make informed decisions about how to allocate their contributions.",,finance,22064
Is the amount taxable if my grandfather sells agricultural land,"As your is a very specific case, please get an advice of CA. It should not cost you much and make it easier. The sale of agriculture land is taxable in certain conditions and exempt from tax in other cases. Sale of agricultural land is subject to capital gains tax. But there are certain exemptions under Section 54B, subject to conditions, which are as follows:    If deemed taxable, you can avail indexation, ie the price at which you grandfather got [the date when he inherited it as per indexation] and pay 10% on the difference. If the price is not known, you can take the govt prescribed rate.   As there is a large deposit in your fathers account, there can be tax queries and need to be answered. Technically there is no tax liable even if your grandfather gifts the money to your father.

declaring payments to a credit card for a shared expense,"If this is a business expense - then this is what is called reimbursement. Reimbursement is usually not considered as income since it is money paid back to you for an expense you covered for your employer with your after-tax money. However, for reimbursement to be considered properly executed, from income tax stand point, there are some requirements. I'm not familiar with the UK income tax law specifics, but I reason the requirements would not differ much from places I'm familiar with: before an expense is reimbursed to you, you should usually do this:  Show that the expense is a valid business expense for the employer benefit and by the employer's request. Submit the receipt for reimbursement and follow the employer's procedure on its approval. When income tax agent looks at your data, he actually will ask about the £1500 tab. You and you'll employer will have to do some explaining about the business activity that caused it. If the revenue agent is not satisfied, the £750 that is paid to you will be declared as your income. If the required procedures for proper reimbursement were not followed - the £750 may be declared as your income regardless of the business need. Have your employer verify it with his tax accountant.","If you are making payments on a credit card for a shared expense, here are some steps you can follow:Determine the total cost of the shared expense.Determine how you will split the cost among the individuals involved. This could be an equal split, or it could be based on each person's contribution to the expense.Have each person contribute their share of the cost to you. This could be done through a direct transfer to your bank account, or by giving you cash or a check.Use the funds you have collected to make the payment on the credit card. Be sure to keep track of who has contributed what, as you will need this information when it comes time to reconcile the expenses.It's also a good idea to keep good records of the shared expenses and payments. This can be helpful for tax purposes or in case there is any disagreement about who paid what.",,finance,19198
Online transaction - Money taken out late,"When processing credit/debit cards there is a choice made by the company on how they want to go about doing it.  The options are Authorization/Capture and Sale. For online transactions that require the delivery of goods, companies are supposed to start by initially Authorizing the transaction.  This signals your bank to mark the funds but it does not actually transfer them.  Once the company is actually shipping the goods, they will send a Capture command that tells the bank to go ahead and transfer the funds.  There can be a time delay between the two actions.  3 days is fairly common, but longer can certainly be seen.  It normally takes a week for a gas station local to me to clear their transactions. The second one, a Sale is normally used for online transactions in which a service is immediately delivered or a Point of Sale transaction (buying something in person at a store).  This action wraps up both an Authorization and Capture into a single step. Now, not all systems have the same requirements.  It is actually fairly common for people who play online games to ""accidentally"" authorize funds to be transferred from their bank.  Processing those refunds can be fairly expensive.  However, if the company simply performs an Authorization and never issues a capture then it's as if the transaction never occurred and the costs involved to the company are much smaller (close to zero) I'd suspect they have a high degree of parents claiming their kids were never authorized to perform transactions or that fraud was involved.  If this is the case then it would be in the company's interest to authorize the transaction, apply the credits to your account then wait a few days before actually capturing the funds from the bank.   Depending upon the amount of time for the wait your bank might have silently rolled back the authorization.  When it came time for the company to capture, then they'd just reissue it as a sale. I hope that makes sense.  The point is, this is actually fairly common.  Not just for games but for a whole host of areas in which fraud might exist (like getting gas).","If you have made an online transaction and the money has been taken out of your account at a later date than you expected, there could be a few reasons for this. Here are some potential explanations:Processing delays: Sometimes, it can take a few days for a transaction to be processed and for the money to be deducted from your account. This is especially common if the transaction involves a bank or financial institution that is located in a different time zone.Fraud prevention measures: In some cases, banks and financial institutions may hold a transaction for a few days to verify that it is legitimate and not fraudulent. This is done to protect you and your account from unauthorized charges.Technical issues: There could be a technical issue with the online payment system or with your bank's systems that is causing the delay.If you are concerned about the delay in the deduction of money from your account, you should contact your bank or the merchant to ask about the status of the transaction. They should be able to provide more information and help resolve any issues.",,finance,21586

What amount of money can a corporation spend on entertainment,"There is no simple rule like ""you can/can't spend more/less than $X per person."" Instead there is a reasonableness test. There is such a thing as an audit of just your travel and entertainment expenses - I know because I've had one for my Ontario corporation. I've deducted company Christmas parties, and going-away dinners for departing employees, without incident. (You know, I presume, about only deducting half of certain expenses?) If the reason for the entertainment is to acquire or keep either employees or clients, there shouldn't be a problem.  Things are slightly trickier with very small companies. Microsoft can send an entire team to Hawaii, with their families, as a reward at the end of a tough project, and deduct it. You probably can't send yourself as a similar reward. If your party is strictly for your neighbours, personal friends, and close family, with no clients, potential clients, employees, potential employees, suppliers, or potential suppliers in attendance, then no, don't deduct it. If you imagine yourself telling an auditor why you threw the party and why the business funded it, you'll know whether it's ok to do it or not.","There is no specific limit on the amount of money that a corporation can spend on entertainment. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has rules in place that regulate the tax treatment of entertainment expenses for businesses. According to IRS guidelines, expenses for entertainment, amusement, or recreation are generally not deductible as a business expense. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.For example, if the entertainment is directly related to the business and occurs during the course of business, it may be deductible as a business expense. For example, if a company takes its clients to a baseball game as part of a business discussion, the cost of the tickets may be deductible as a business expense. In addition, if the entertainment is considered ""ordinary and necessary"" for the business, it may also be deductible.It's important to note that even if an entertainment expense meets the criteria for being deductible, the IRS only allows a deduction of 50% of the cost. This means that if a company spends $100 on entertainment, it can only claim a deduction of $50 on its tax return.It's also worth noting that corporations must be careful not to use entertainment expenses as a way to avoid paying taxes. The IRS has strict rules in place to prevent abuse of the tax code, and it may disallow deductions or assess penalties if it determines that a company is using entertainment expenses improperly.",,finance,21439
What is the best way to determine if you should refinance a mortgage?,"Yes, take the new rate, but instead of using the new 30 year term, calculate the payment as though the new mortgage were at the remaining term. 3 years into a 30? You calculate the payment as if the new mortgage were 27 years.  This will tell you what you are really saving. Now, take that savings and divide into your closing costs if any. That will give you the break even. Will you be in the house that long?  If you can find a no closing cost deal, it's worth it for even 1/8% savings.","There are several factors to consider when deciding whether to refinance a mortgage. Here are a few key points to consider:Current interest rates: If current mortgage rates are significantly lower than the rate you are paying on your existing mortgage, refinancing could be a good option.Length of time you plan to stay in the home: It typically takes several years to recoup the costs of refinancing through lower monthly payments. If you don't plan to stay in the home for at least a few more years, refinancing may not make financial sense.Fees and closing costs: Refinancing typically involves paying various fees and closing costs, which can add up. Make sure to factor these costs into your decision, as they can impact the overall financial benefits of refinancing.Credit score: Your credit score can impact the interest rate you are offered when refinancing. If your credit score has improved since you took out your original mortgage, you may be able to secure a lower interest rate through refinancing.Other financial goals: Consider whether refinancing your mortgage aligns with your other financial goals, such as paying off high-interest debt or saving for retirement.It can be helpful to consult with a financial advisor or mortgage lender to evaluate your specific situation and determine whether refinancing is a good option for you.",,finance,22449

Death and Capital Gains Taxes (United States),"Stocks (among other property) currently is allowed a ""stepped-up basis"" when valuing for estate tax purpose.  From the US IRS web page: To determine if the sale of inherited property is taxable, you must first determine your basis in the property. The basis of property inherited from a decedent is generally one of the following: The fair market value (FMV) of the property on the date of the decedent's death. The FMV of the property on the alternate valuation date if the executor of the estate chooses to use alternate valuation. See the Instructions for Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return. If you or your spouse gave the property to the decedent within one year before the decedent's death, see Publication 551, Basis of Assets. Your question continues ""the person that died still has to pay taxes on their profits in the year they died, right?"" Yes. The estate would be subject to tax on realized gains/losses prior to death.","In the United States, capital gains are profits from the sale of assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. When a person dies, their capital gains tax liability may be affected. Here's how it works:If the asset was held for less than one year before being sold, it is considered a short-term capital gain and is taxed at the same rate as the deceased person's ordinary income.If the asset was held for more than one year before being sold, it is considered a long-term capital gain and is typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.When a person dies, their assets are typically passed on to their heirs. If the asset is passed on to an heir, it receives a ""stepped-up basis,"" meaning that the basis (usually the original purchase price) is increased to the fair market value at the time of the person's death. This can result in a lower capital gains tax liability for the heir when they sell the asset.For example, let's say that a person buys a stock for $10,000 and holds it for 10 years before selling it for $50,000. If they sell the stock while they are alive, they will owe capital gains tax on the $40,000 profit. However, if they pass away and the stock is passed on to an heir who sells it for $50,000, the heir will only owe capital gains tax on the profit above the stepped-up basis of $50,000.It's important to note that there are many rules and exceptions that apply to capital gains tax, and the specifics can depend on the individual circumstances. If you have questions about capital gains tax and how it may apply to you or your heirs, it's a good idea to consult with a tax professional.",,finance,20330
Do the activities of my LLC need to be limited to a particular field?,"No. When you file your Articles of Organization, simply state that your business will operate under the law. You don't need to give any further specification.","It depends on the type of LLC you have and the laws of the state in which your LLC is organized. In most states, LLCs are formed by filing articles of organization with the state government and are not required to limit their activities to a particular field. However, some states do require LLCs to specify a specific business purpose or field of activity in their articles of organization. Additionally, it is possible to form a specialized LLC, such as a professional LLC (PLLC) or a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is restricted to certain types of businesses or professions.It is also worth noting that LLCs may be subject to additional regulations depending on the type of business they are engaged in. For example, if an LLC is engaged in a regulated industry, such as financial services or healthcare, it may be subject to additional licensing or regulatory requirements.Overall, it is important to understand the laws and regulations that apply to your LLC and to ensure that your business activities are in compliance with those laws. If you are uncertain about the requirements that apply to your LLC, you may want to consult with an attorney or a tax professional.",,finance,21839
US citizen transferring money to Indian fiance to buy property,"A. Kindly avoid taking dollars in form of cash to india unless and until it is an emergency. Once the dollar value is in excess of $10,000, you need to declare the same with Indian customs at the destination. Even though it is not a cumbersome procedure, why unnecessarily undergo all sort of documentation and most importantly at all security checks, you will be asked questions on dollars and you need to keep answering.   Finally safety issue is always there during the journey.  B.There is no Tax on the amount you declare. You can bring in any amount. All you need is to declare the same.  C. It is always better to do a wire transfer.  D. Any transfer in excess of $14,000 from US, will atract gift tax as per IRS guidelines. You need to declare the same while filing your Income Tax in US and pay the gift tax accordingly.  E. Once your fiance receives the money , any amount in excess of Rs 50,000 would be treated as individual income and he has to show the same under Income from other sources while filing the taxes. Taxes will be as per the slab he falls under.  F.Only for blood relatives , this limit of 50,000 does not apply.  G. Reg the Loan option, suggest do not opt for the same. Incase you want to go ahead, then pl ensure that you fully comply with IRS rules on Loans made to a foreign person from a US citizen or resident. The person lending the money must report the interest payment as income on his or her yearly tax return provided the loan has interest element. No deduction is allowed if the proceeds are used for personal or non-business purposes.In the case of no-interest loans, most people believe there is no taxable income because no interest is paid.  The IRS views this seriously and the tax rules are astonishingly complex  when it comes to no-interest loans.  Even though no interest is paid to the lender, the IRS will treat the transaction as if the borrower paid interest at the applicable federal rate to the lender and the lender subsequently gifted the interest back to the borrower.The lender is taxed on the imaginary interest income and, depending on the amount, may also be liable for gift tax on the imaginary payment made back to the borrower. Hope the above claryfies your query. Since this involves taxation suggest you take an opinion from a Tax attorney and also ask your fiance to consult a Charted Accountant on the same. Regards","If you are a US citizen and you want to transfer money to your Indian fiance to buy property in India, there are a few steps you will need to follow.Make sure you have all the necessary documents and information. This may include proof of your identity, proof of your relationship with your fiance, and any documents related to the property purchase.Choose a reputable financial institution or money transfer service to facilitate the transfer.

Timing between loans and applying for a new credit card,"There were several areas where the mortgage and car loan have affected your credit.  The mortgage had the following impacts, The car loan (purchased shortly after the house) had the following impacts, You did not mention your payment history, but since you had an 800 prior to the house purchase, we can assume that your payment history is current (nothing late). You did not mention your credit utilization, but you want to keep your utilization low (various experts suggest 10%, 20% and 30% as thresholds).  The down payment on the house likely drained your available funds, and replacing the car may have also put stress on your funds.  And when you buy a house, often there are additional expenses that further strain budgets. My guess is that your utilization percentage has increased.  My suggestion would be to reduce your utilization ratio on your revolving accounts.  And since you have plenty of credit lines, you might want to payoff the car. Your Chase card has a good age, which helps with age of credit, and though you will find experts that say you should only have 2-4 revolving accounts (credit cards), other experience shows that having accounts with age on them is a good thing.  And having a larger number of accounts does not cause problems (unless you have higher utilization or you miss payments). You did not mention whether the Chase card has any fees or expenses, as that would be a reason to either negotiate with Chase to reduce or eliminate the fees, or to cancel the card. Have you checked your credit report for errors?  You can get a free report from each of the three bureaus once per year.","There is no specific timing that you need to follow when it comes to taking out a loan and applying for a new credit card. However, there are a few things to consider that may affect your ability to get approved for a credit card or the terms you may be offered.If you have recently taken out a loan, your credit score may be affected, depending on the type of loan and your payment history. If you have a lot of new credit accounts or loans, it may also impact your credit score. This is because having a lot of new credit accounts can be seen as a risk to lenders, as it may indicate that you are taking on more debt than you can handle.That being said, if you have a good credit score and a stable financial situation, taking out a loan or applying for a credit card should not be a problem. It's always a good idea to check your credit score before applying for any new credit to see where you stand and to make sure there are no errors on your credit report. You can get a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) once a year by visiting AnnualCreditReport.com.It's also important to consider your financial situation and whether you will be able to handle the additional debt that a loan or credit card may bring. Make sure you can afford the monthly payments and that taking on this additional debt will not put you in a financially precarious position.",,finance,22199
What are some pre-tax programs similar to FSA that I can take advantage of?,There is a dependent care spending account for child care related expenses. Also Medical and Dental expenses over a certain % of your income maybe deductible on your tax return.,"There are several pre-tax programs similar to a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) that you may be able to take advantage of, depending on your employer and your personal circumstances. Some options include:Health Savings Account (HSA): This account is available to those with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). Contributions to an HSA are tax-free, and the money can be used to pay for qualifying medical expenses.Dependent Care Assistance Plan (DCAP): This plan allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for child care or elderly care expenses while you are working.Transit and Parking Benefits: If your employer offers a transit and parking benefits program, you may be able to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for public transportation or parking expenses related to your commute to work.Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA): An HRA is an employer-funded account that can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as copays and deductibles.Commuter Benefits: Some employers offer a commuter benefits program, which allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for qualified transportation expenses, such as public transportation or vanpooling.It's important to note that these programs may have different eligibility requirements and restrictions, so it's a good idea to talk to your employer or a financial professional to determine which options may be available to you and how they can best benefit you.",,finance,20005
Why does the Brexit cause a fall in crude oil prices? ,"Uncertainty has very far reaching effects.   Oil is up ~100% since February and down ~40% from it's 52 week high (and down even more on a longer timeline).  It's not exactly a stable investment vehicle and moves a few percent each day on basically nothing.  A lot of securities will be bouncing around for the next couple weeks at least while folks remain uncertain about what the ""brexit"" will actually mean.","The Brexit, or the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, is not directly responsible for the fall in crude oil prices. Crude oil prices are determined by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, political instability in oil-producing countries, and the strength of the US dollar (since oil is priced in dollars).However, the Brexit may have indirectly affected oil prices by affecting the global economy. The UK is a major economic player, and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process may have contributed to economic uncertainty and weaker demand for crude oil. Additionally, the Brexit may have had an impact on the value of the British pound, which may have affected the price of oil in pounds.",,finance,19151
Perform exercise-and-hold AND exercise-and-sell-to-cover?,Ask the folks administering your plan. They're the ones who define and implement the available choices for that specific plan.,"Exercise-and-hold and exercise-and-sell-to-cover are two options that an individual may have when they hold stock options.Exercise-and-hold refers to the option holder choosing to exercise their option to purchase shares of the underlying stock at a predetermined price (the strike price), and then holding onto those shares for a period of time. This can be a good strategy if the individual believes that the stock price will continue to rise and they will be able to sell the shares for a profit at a later date.Exercise-and-sell-to-cover refers to the option holder choosing to exercise their option to purchase shares of the underlying stock at the strike price, and then immediately selling those shares to cover the cost of the exercise. This can be a good strategy if the individual believes that the stock price is likely to decline or they need to free up cash for other purposes.It is important to note that exercising stock options carries financial risks and should be done carefully after considering all of the relevant factors, including the individual's financial situation, the tax implications of the exercise, and the potential risks and rewards of holding or selling the shares. It is always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional before making any decisions about exercising stock options.",,finance,21495
How risky is it to keep my emergency fund in stocks?,"I do this very thing, but with asset allocation and risk parity in mind. I disagree with the cash or bust answers above, but many of the aforementioned facts are valuable and I don't mean to undermine them in anyway. That said, let's look at two examples: Option 1: All-in For the sake of argument let's say you had $100k invested in the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) in early 2007, and you kept it there until today. Your lowest balance would have been about $51k, and at this point the possibility of you losing your job was probably at a peak. Today you would be left with $170k assuming no withdrawal. Option 2: Risk Parity BUT if you balanced your investments with a risk parity approach, using negatively correlated asset classes you avoid this dilemma. If you had invested 50% in XLP (Consumer Staples Sector ETF) and 50% in TLT ( Long Term Treasury ETF) your investments low point would have been $88k, and your lowest annual return would be +0.69%. Today you would be left with $214k assuming no withdrawals.  I chose option #2 and it hasn't failed me yet, even in 2016 so far the results are steady and reliably given the reward. My general opinion is simple: when you have money always grow it. Just be sure to cover your ass and prepare for rain. Backtesting for this was done at portfoliovisualizer.com, the one caveat to this approach is that inflation and a lack of international exposure are a risk here.","It is generally considered to be riskier to keep an emergency fund in stocks compared to more conservative options such as high-yield savings accounts or short-term government bonds. This is because the stock market can be volatile, and the value of your investments can fluctuate significantly over a short period of time. If you need to use your emergency fund in a time of market turmoil, you could end up selling your investments at a loss. On the other hand, high-yield savings accounts and short-term government bonds tend to be much more stable, so the value of your money is less likely to fluctuate.That being said, the potential for higher returns is also a consideration. If you are comfortable with the risk and have a long time horizon until you need to use your emergency fund, investing in stocks may potentially offer higher returns compared to more conservative options.Ultimately, the decision of where to keep your emergency fund will depend on your personal risk tolerance and financial situation. It may be helpful to speak with a financial professional to determine the best course of action for you.",,finance,22062
What is the difference between a stock and a bond?,"In a sentence, stocks are a share of equity in the company, while bonds are a share of credit to the company. When you buy one share of stock, you own a (typically infinitesimal) percentage of the company. You are usually entitled to a share of the profits of that company, and/or to participate in the business decisions of that company. A particular type of stock may or may not pay dividends, which is the primary way companies share profits with their stockholders (the other way is simply by increasing the company's share value by being successful and thus desirable to investors). A stock also may or may not allow you to vote on company business; you may hear about companies buying 20% or 30% ""interests"" in other companies; they own that percentage of the company, and their vote on company matters is given that same weight in the total voting pool. Typically, a company offers two levels of stocks: ""Common"" stock usually has voting rights attached, and may pay dividends. ""Preferred"" stock usually gives up the voting rights, but pays a higher dividend percentage (maybe double or triple that of common stock) and may have payment guarantees (if a promised dividend is missed in one quarter and then paid in the next, the preferred stockholders get their dividend for the past and present quarters before the common shareholders see a penny). Governments and non-profits are typically prohibited from selling their equity; if a government sold stock it would basically be taxing everyone and then paying back stockholders, while non-profit organizations have no profits to pay out as dividends. Bonds, on the other hand, are a slice of the company's debt load. Think of bonds as kind of like a corporate credit card. When a company needs a lot of cash, it will sell bonds. A single bond may be worth $10, $100, or $1000, depending on the investor market being targeted. This is the amount the company will pay the bondholder at the end of the term of the bond. These bonds are bought by investors on the open market for less than their face value, and the company uses the cash it raises for whatever purpose it wants, before paying off the bondholders at term's end (usually by paying each bond at face value using money from a new package of bonds, in effect ""rolling over"" the debt to the next cycle, similar to you carrying a balance on your credit card). The difference between the cost and payoff is the ""interest charge"" on this slice of the loan, and can be expressed as a percentage of the purchase price over the remaining term of the bond, as its ""yield"" or ""APY"". For example, a bond worth $100 that was sold on Jan 1 for $85 and is due to be paid on Dec 31 of the same year has an APY of (15/85*100) = 17.65%. Typically, yields for highly-rated companies are more like 4-6%; a bond that would yield 17% is very risky and indicates a very low bond rating, so-called ""junk status"".","A stock represents ownership in a company, while a bond is a debt instrument. When you buy a stock, you are purchasing a share of ownership in a company. As an owner, you have the right to vote at shareholder meetings and receive dividends, which are payments made to shareholders out of the company's profits. The value of a stock can fluctuate based on the performance of the company and the overall stock market.On the other hand, a bond is a loan that an investor makes to a company or government. In exchange for lending money, the issuer of the bond agrees to pay the investor periodic interest payments and return the principal (the amount borrowed) when the bond reaches maturity. The value of a bond is largely determined by the creditworthiness of the issuer, as well as market interest rates.In summary, stocks represent an ownership stake in a company, while bonds represent a loan to a company or government.",,finance,20548
Investment Portfolio Setup for beginner,"Some thoughts: 1) Do you have a significant emergency fund (3-6 months of after-tax living expenses)? If not, you stand to take a significant loss if you have an unexpected need for cash that is tied up in investments. What if you lose/hate your job or your car breaks down? What if a you want to spend some time with a relative or significant other who learns they only have a few months to live? Having a dedicated emergency fund is an important way to avoid downside risk. 2) Lagerbaer has a good suggestion. Given that if you'd reinvested your dividends, the S&P 500 has returned about 3.5% over the last 5 years, you may be able to get a very nice risk-free return.  3) Do you have access to employer matching funds, such as in a 401(k) at work? If you get a dollar-for-dollar match, that is a risk-free pre-tax 100% return and should be a high priority. 4) What do you mean by ""medium"" volatility? Given that you are considering a 2/3 equity allocation, it would not be at all out of the realm of possibility that your balance could fall by 15% or more in any given year and take several years to recover. If that would spook you, you may want to consider lowering your equity weights. A high quality bond fund may be a good fit. 5) Personally, I would avoid putting money into stocks that I didn't need back for 10 years. If you only want to tie your money up for 2-5 years, you are taking a significant risk that if prices fall, you won't have time to recover before you need your money back. The portfolio you described would be appropriate for someone with a long-term investment horizon and significant risk tolerance, which is usually the case for young people saving for retirement. However, if your goals are to invest for 2-5 years only, your situation would be significantly different.  6) You can often borrow from an investment account to purchase a primary residence, but you must pay that amount back in order to avoid significant taxes and fees, unless you plan to liquidate assets. If you plan to buy a house, saving enough to avoid PMI is a good risk-free return on your money. 7) In general, and ETF or index fund is a good idea, the key being to minimize the compound effect of expenses over the long term. There are many good choices a la Vanguard here to choose from. 8) Don't worry about ""Buy low, sell high"". Don't be a speculator, be an investor (that's my version of Anthony Bourdain's, ""don't be a tourist, be a traveler""). A speculator wants to sell shares at a higher price than they were purchased at. An investor wants to share in the profits of a company as a part-owner. If you can consistently beat the market by trying to time your transactions, good for you - you can move to Wall Street and make millions. However, almost no one can do this consistently, and it doesn't seem worth it to me to try. I don't mean to discourage you from investing, just make sure you have your bases covered so that you don't have to cash out at a bad time. Best of luck! Edit Response to additional questions below. 1) Emergency fund. I would recommend not investing in anything other than cash equivalents (money market, short-term CDs, etc.) until you've built up an emergency fund. It makes sense to want to make the ""best"" use of your money, but you also have to account for risk. My concern is that if you were to experience one or more adverse life events, that you could lose a lot of money, or need to pay a lot in interest on credit card debt, and it would be prudent to self-insure against some of those risks. I would also recommend against using an investment account as an emergency fund account. Taking money out of investment accounts is inefficient because the commissions/taxes/fees can easily eat up a significant portion of your returns. Ideally, you would want to put money in and not touch it for a long time in order to take advantage of compounding returns. There are also high penalties for early disbursements from retirement funds. Just like you need enough money in your checking account to buy food and pay the rent every month, you need enough money in an emergency fund to pay for things that are a real possibility, even if they are less common. Using a credit card or an investment account is a relatively expensive way to do this. 2) Invest at all? I would recommend starting an emergency fund, and then beginning to invest for retirement. Once your retirement savings are on track, you can begin saving for whatever other goals you may have","If you are a beginner investor, it is important to start with a diversified portfolio that is appropriate for your financial situation and goals. Here are some steps you can follow to set up an investment portfolio:Determine your investment goals: What do you want to achieve through your investments? Do you want to save for retirement, for a down payment on a home, or for some other financial goal? Having clear goals will help you make investment decisions that align with your financial plans.Assess your risk tolerance: Different investments carry different levels of risk. It is important to choose investments that are appropriate for your risk tolerance. If you are a more conservative investor, you may want to choose investments with lower levels of risk, such as bonds or funds that invest in blue-chip stocks. If you are a more aggressive investor, you may be willing to accept higher levels of risk in exchange for the potential for higher returns.Determine your asset allocation: Your asset allocation is the mix of different types of assets in your portfolio. A common approach is to allocate a portion of your portfolio to stocks, a portion to bonds, and a portion to cash or other short-term investments. A well-diversified portfolio typically includes a mix of assets across different asset classes, such as domestic and international stocks, different types of bonds (e.g., corporate, government, municipal), and cash or other short-term investments.Choose specific investments: Once you have a sense of your investment goals, risk tolerance, and asset allocation, you can begin choosing specific investments for your portfolio. Some options may include individual stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and index funds.Review and rebalance your portfolio: As your financial situation or goals change, it is important to review and adjust your portfolio as needed. This may involve selling some investments and buying others to maintain your desired asset allocation.I hope this helps!

After Hours S&P 500,"My original answer contained a fundamental error: it turns out that it is not true that any exchange can create its own product to track any underlying index.  If the underlying index is copyrighted (such as the S&P indices, Russell indices, Dow Jones indices, etc.) then the exchange must enter into a licensing agreement (usually exclusive) with the copyright holder in order to use the index's formula (and name).  Without such a license the exchange would only be able to approximate the underlying index, and I don't think that happens very much (because how would you market such a product?). The CME offers several futures (and other derivatives) whose face value is equivalent to some multiple of the S&P500's value on the date when the product expires.  When such a product is actively traded, it may serve as a reasonable indicator of the ""market""'s expectation of the S&P500's future value. So, you could pay attention to the front month of the CME's S&P 500 Mini future, which trades from 17:00-16:00 Chicago time, Sunday night through Friday afternoon.  But remember that the prices quoted there are As another example, if you care about the Russell 2000 index, until 2017 the ICE Exchange happened to hold the license for its derivatives.  They traded from 20:00-17:30 New York time, Sunday night through Friday afternoon.  But in mid-2017 CME bought that license as well, so now you'll want to track it here. Moral: There's almost always some ""after hours"" product out there tracking whatever index you care about, but you may have to do some digging to find it, and it might not be all that useful for your specific purpose.","The S&P 500 is a stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large publicly traded companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is a widely followed benchmark for the stock market. The index is calculated using the prices of the individual stocks, with the level of the index being determined by the overall value of the stocks in the index relative to a particular base period.Trading in the S&P 500 typically occurs during regular market hours, which are from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) on weekdays. After regular market hours, there is a period known as ""after hours trading,"" during which traders can buy and sell stocks outside of the regular market hours. After hours trading can be more volatile than regular market hours, as there is typically less liquidity and fewer market participants. It is important to note that prices quoted during after hours trading may not necessarily reflect the prices that will be quoted when the market opens the next day.",,finance,22720
Covered call and put options as separate trades,"Yes, if the call expires worthless, leaving you with stock. Then you can exercise your put when the stock goes below put strike price.","Sure! A covered call option is a strategy in which an investor holds a long position in an asset and sells or writes call options on that same asset in order to generate income. A covered put option is similar, but the investor writes or sells put options on an asset that they own, rather than selling call options.In both cases, the investor is said to be ""covered"" because they own the underlying asset, which means they can deliver the asset to the buyer of the option if the option is exercised. This is in contrast to an uncovered or naked option, in which the investor does not own the underlying asset and would have to buy it at the market price if the option is exercised.Covered call options can be used to generate income in a neutral or bullish market, while covered put options can be used to generate income in a neutral or bearish market. Both strategies can be used to hedge against potential losses on the underlying asset, and both involve the sale of options and the potential to receive option premiums.",,finance,19344

How can a company charge a closed credit card?,"Wow, I had never heard of this before but I looked into it a bit and Mikey was spot on. It seems that if you don't pay attention to the fine print when making credit card purchases (as most of us tend to skip) many companies have stipulations that allow continued charges if they are recurring fees (monthly, yearly, etc.) even after you have cancelled the card.","It is generally not possible for a company to charge a closed credit card. When a credit card is closed, the account is no longer active, and the credit card issuer will not allow any further charges to be made on the account. If a company tries to charge a closed credit card, the transaction will likely be declined.If you have closed a credit card but are still being charged by a company, there may be a misunderstanding or an error. In this case, it is important to contact the company to explain the situation and resolve the issue. If the charges are unauthorized or fraudulent, you should also report the issue to your credit card issuer and the appropriate authorities.",,finance,22277
When a Company was expected and then made a profit of X $ then that X$ increased it's share price. or those the Sellers and Buyers [duplicate],"There are a few reason why share prices increase or decrease, the foremost is expectation of the investors that the company/economy will do well/not well, that is expectation of profit/intrinsic value growth over some time frame (1-4 qtrs.)there is also demand & supply mismatch over (usually) short time. If you really see, the actual 'value' of a company is it's net-worth (cash+asset+stock in trade+brand value+other intangibles+other incomes)/no of shares outstanding, which (in a way) is the book value, then all shares should trade at their book value, the actual number but it does not, the expectation of investors that a share would be purchased by another investor at a higher price because the outlook of the company over a long time is good.","In general, when a company announces that it has made a profit, it can lead to an increase in the company's share price. This is because investors may see the profit as a sign that the company is financially healthy and doing well. As a result, more investors may be interested in buying the company's shares, which can lead to an increase in demand for the shares and a corresponding increase in the share price.However, it's important to note that there are many other factors that can affect a company's share price, including economic conditions, market trends, and the performance of other companies in the same industry. So while a profit announcement may contribute to an increase in the share price, it is not the only factor that can influence the price.",,finance,20435
Ensuring payment from client,"You should absolutely have a contract between you and your client stipulating the quid-pro-quos of the arrangement. They get the product, you get the money. First off, this contract should specify what you must do, and what they must do, for the contract to be ""satisfied"". This isn't necessarily just product for money; your client may be under deadlines to approve the product in various stages of work in process. Depending on the product, the client may be required to provide starting materials (like existing logos/slogans for advertising/marketing graphics), information on or access to computer systems (for software or infrastructure consulting, or accounting auditing), etc. Second, if you provide a tangible product like graphics or software, the contract should clearly state that ""intellectual property transfers on satisfaction of contract""; they don't own what you have made until they have accepted it and paid you accordingly. If they try to stiff you by taking what you made them and using it before you've been paid, you can take them to the cleaner's for copyright violations. Third, you should structure a payment schedule; don't do too much for free. You can get the money in thirds, for instance; a third up front, a third at some defined halfway point and a third on final delivery and acceptance. Lastly, you should stipulate that the client is responsible for all expenses incurred by you as a result of their failure to pay as stipulated, up to and including attorney's fees. Definitely have a lawyer draft these agreements; contract law is a many-layered area of law with hundreds of years of case law and slightly different nuances in every state. A competent lawyer will know things that can and can't be stipulated in a contract, and if you try to do it alone you'll wish you hadn't when the contract's tossed out by a judge because of some technicality. If they refuse to pay, get the lawyer on the phone and file suit. A well-written contract drafted by a competent lawyer, which you have lived up to on your end, will give your client no loopholes to slip through. As far as recovering damages, it shouldn't matter whether he's in the U.S. or not; if he does business in the U.S. then he very probably has money in banks that have to listen to U.S. courts (or at least court orders).","There are several steps you can take to ensure payment from a client:Clearly define the terms of the payment in your contract: Make sure that the payment terms, including the amount, due date, and method of payment, are clearly stated in your contract.Use a payment gateway: Consider using a payment gateway, such as PayPal or Stripe, to securely process payments. These services provide an extra layer of protection and make it easier to track payments and issue refunds if necessary.Request a deposit: Asking for a deposit upfront can help reduce the risk of non-payment. You can specify in your contract that the balance is due upon completion of the work.Follow up on overdue payments: If a payment is overdue, it's important to follow up with the client as soon as possible. You can send a friendly reminder via email or phone, or consider hiring a collections agency if the payment is significantly overdue.Take legal action: As a last resort, you may need to take legal action to recover payment. It's important to consult with a lawyer before pursuing this option.By taking these steps, you can increase the chances of getting paid on time and avoid potential payment disputes with your clients.",,finance,20856
Why UK bank charges are not taken account when looking on interest for taxation?,Because your profit from the capital IS 100 quid. Capital gains is not like running a business and doesn't come with tax deductions. It's up to you to pick saving scheme that maximizes your profit (either via low costs or highest possible rate).,"In the United Kingdom, bank charges are generally not considered to be interest for tax purposes. This means that they are not included in the calculation of taxable interest income.Instead, bank charges are typically treated as expenses that are incurred in the course of earning taxable income. As such, they can usually be deducted from taxable income when calculating the tax liability.For example, if you have a savings account that earns interest, the interest you receive is considered to be taxable income. However, if you also incur charges for maintaining the account, such as monthly fees or charges for exceeding your allowed number of transactions, these charges can generally be deducted from your taxable income.It's important to note that the tax treatment of bank charges can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the type of charges involved. It's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to the relevant tax laws and guidelines to ensure that you are properly reporting your income and deductions.",,finance,20639
Do I need a Like-Kind Exchange when selling a personal vehicle for a company car,"You cannot do a like-kind (Sec. 1031) exchange for personal property, only for business/investment property. Since you said that you traded in your personal car - no like-kind exchange is possible. Also, since the new car doesn't belong to you - you didn't actually perform any exchange. You sold your old car, but you didn't buy a new one. If Turbo-Tax suggests you to fill the exchange form - you must have entered something wrong to make it think there was an exchange. Check your entries again, specifically - check if you entered that you purchased a new car instead of the old one, since you didn't. See an example of where to start looking here.","In general, a like-kind exchange, also known as a Section 1031 exchange, refers to the exchange of one investment property for another investment property of a similar type. It allows taxpayers to defer paying capital gains tax on the sale of an investment property by using the proceeds from the sale to purchase a new investment property.If you are selling a personal vehicle and using the proceeds to purchase a company car, it is unlikely that a like-kind exchange would be applicable. This is because personal vehicles and company cars are not considered investment properties for tax purposes. Instead, the sale of a personal vehicle is typically considered a personal transaction and is not eligible for a like-kind exchange.However, it is possible that the company car you are purchasing could qualify as an investment property for tax purposes if it is being used for business purposes. In this case, the sale of the personal vehicle and the purchase of the company car could potentially qualify for a like-kind exchange.It is always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to the IRS guidelines to determine whether a like-kind exchange is applicable in your specific situation.",,finance,19992
"Canada: New mortgage qualification rules, 2010: Why, what, & when in effect?","The new mortgage qualification rules were introduced to cool a hot Canadian housing real estate market. The rules are a pre-emptive measure intended to avoid a bubble (and later crash) in real estate. The government wants to make sure anybody buying a house can handle higher interest rates. Those rates, currently at record lows, are expected to go up later this year and into the future. The tighter mortgage rules include: Borrowers will need to qualify against a minimum standard 5-year fixed rate mortgage, even if they'll contract their mortgage at a lower or variable rate.  Previously, the 3-year fixed rate mortgage was used as the minimum qualification standard. The amount a homeowner can borrow in a refinanced mortgage drops to 90% of the home value, down from 95% of the home value.  A home is not meant to be an ATM machine. Anybody wanting to borrow to buy an investment property – i.e. a property that won't be their principal residence – will need a 20% downpayment instead of a 5% downpayment. The new rules go into effect April 19th, 2010.  However, according to the backgrounder (see below): Exceptions would be allowed after   April 19 where they are needed to   satisfy a binding purchase and sale,   financing, or refinancing agreement   entered into before April 19, 2010. Definitive information about the new rules can be found at the Department of Finance of Canada.  Specifically, refer to: Some additional news media sources:","In 2010, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) in Canada introduced new mortgage qualification rules, known as the ""stress test,"" in order to ensure that borrowers could still make their mortgage payments if interest rates were to rise or their personal circumstances changed. These rules went into effect on October 17, 2016.The stress test requires borrowers to qualify for a mortgage at a higher interest rate than the rate they are actually being offered by their lender. For example, if a borrower is being offered a mortgage at a rate of 3%, they must qualify for the mortgage at a rate of at least the Bank of Canada's five-year benchmark rate, which is currently 5.24%, or at the lender's contract rate plus an additional 2%, whichever is higher. This helps to ensure that borrowers can still afford their mortgage payments if interest rates were to rise in the future.The stress test applies to all insured mortgages, which are mortgages with a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price. It also applies to uninsured mortgages for borrowers who have a credit score of 680 or higher and who meet certain other criteria.The main reason for introducing the stress test was to help reduce the risk of default on mortgages and to protect the stability of the housing market in Canada. The stress test has been controversial, with some arguing that it has made it more difficult for first-time homebuyers to enter the housing market, while others argue that it has helped to prevent a housing bubble and to protect the financial stability of the country.",,finance,19896

How to interpret these explanatory graphs (about option strategies)?,"The blue line is illustrating the net profit or loss the investor will realise according to how the price of the underlying asset settles at expiry. The x-axis represents the underlying asset price.  The y-axis represents the profit or loss. In the first case, the investor has a ""naked put write"" position, having sold a put option.  The strike price of the put is marked as ""A"" on the x-axis.  The maximum profit possible is equal to the total premium received when the option contract was sold.  This is represented by that portion of the blue line that is horizontal and extending from the point above that point marked ""A"" on the x-axis.  This corresponds to the case that the price of the underlying asset settles at or above the strike price on the day of expiry.  If the underlying asset settles at a price less than the strike price on the day of expiry, then the option with be ""in the money"".  Therefore the net settlement value will move from a profit to a loss, depending on how far in the money the option is upon expiry.  This is represented by the diagonal line moving from above the ""A"" point on the x-axis and moving from a profit to a loss on the y-axis.  The diagonal line crosses the x-axis at the point where the underlying asset price is equal to ""A"" minus the original premium rate at which the option was written - i.e., net profit = zero.  In the second case, the investor has sold a put option with a strike price of ""B"" and purchase a put option with a strike price ""A"", where A is less than B.  Here, the reasoning is similar to the first example, however since a put option has been purchase this will limit the potential losses should the underlying asset move down strongly in value. The horizontal line above the x-axis marks the maximum profit while the horizontal line below the x-axis marks the maximum loss. Note that the horizontal line above the x-axis is closer to the x-axis that is the horizontal line below the x-axis.  This is because the maximum profit is equal to the premium received for selling the put option minus the premium payed for buying the put option at a lower strike price.  Losses are limited since any loss in excess of the strike price ""A"" plus the premium payed for the put purchased at a strike price of ""A"" is covered by the profit made on the purchased put option at a strike price of ""A"".",Could you provide more context about the explanatory graphs you are referring to and what option strategies they are related to?

How do LLC losses affect personal income taxes in the US?,"The short answer is yes, losses get passed through to members. Limits/percentages do apply, primarily based on your share in the business. Check out the final post in this thread:  http://community2.business.gov/t5/Other-Business-Issues/Paying-oneself-in-a-LLC/td-p/16060  It's not a bad little summary of the profit/loss pass-through.  Regarding your 60K/60K example: the amount of money you earn in your day job will impact how much loss you can claim. Unfortunately I can't find anything more recent at the IRS or business.gov, but see this from 2004 - 40K was the limit before the amount you could claim against started to be mitigated: http://en.allexperts.com/q/Tax-Law-Questions-932/tax-loss-pass.htm HTH","In the United States, a limited liability company (LLC) is a type of business structure that combines the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership. LLCs are taxed as a partnership by default, but they can also elect to be taxed as a corporation.If an LLC is taxed as a partnership, the profits and losses of the business are passed through to the individual members of the LLC and are reported on their personal income tax returns. This means that the LLC does not pay taxes on its income at the corporate level; instead, the profits and losses are allocated to the members based on their ownership interests in the LLC and are taxed at the individual level.For example, if an LLC has a net loss for the year, each member of the LLC can claim their allocated share of the loss on their personal income tax return. This can help offset other sources of income and potentially reduce the member's overall tax liability. However, it's important to note that the IRS has rules in place to prevent individuals from using LLC losses to offset income from other sources in an abusive manner.If an LLC elects to be taxed as a corporation, it will be subject to corporate income tax on its profits. Any distributions to the members of the LLC will be treated as dividends, which are taxed at the individual level.It's worth noting that LLCs are generally more flexible than corporations when it comes to how profits and losses are allocated among the members. This can make them a good choice for small businesses that want to minimize their tax liability while still enjoying the liability protection of a corporation. However, it's important to consult with a tax professional to determine the best tax treatment for your LLC based on your specific circumstances.",,finance,19368
How is Massachusetts state tax on unrealized capital gains calculated?,"Massachusets does no such thing. The 5.25% tax is only on realized gains. ""Unearned"" means ""doesn't tie to your trade/business"", i.e.: is not gained through your personal performance.","In Massachusetts, capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, so they are subject to the same tax rates as other types of income.

Then, you can apply the appropriate tax rate to your taxable income to calculate your tax liability.It's important to note that these tax rates and brackets apply to your federal taxable income after you have claimed any deductions or exemptions.

Best Practices for Managing Paper Receipts,"I store all my receipts digitally, and make sure to input them into accounting program sooner than later, just so I don't forget about it. For practical purposes, the two important things are: Any kind of a digital system makes this pretty easy, even just putting the sums in a spreadsheet and the receipts into files with the date in the name. However, because it's easy enough, I also have a box where I stuff the paper receipts. I expect never to need them, but should something very weird happen to my computer and backups, they would be there.","Here are some best practices for managing paper receipts:Keep receipts organized: Create a system for organizing receipts, such as using envelopes or a folder to keep them in a specific place. This will make it easier to find receipts when you need them.Scan or photograph receipts: Use a smartphone or scanner to create digital copies of receipts. This will allow you to access them easily and minimize clutter.Label receipts: Clearly label receipts with the date and purpose of the purchase. This will make it easier to identify the purpose of the receipt when you need to reference it.Keep important receipts: Keep receipts for large purchases or those that have a warranty or return policy. These receipts will be useful if you need to make a return or claim a warranty.Discard unnecessary receipts: Regularly go through your receipts and discard those that are no longer needed. This will help to minimize clutter and make it easier to find important receipts.Use receipt tracking software: There are several receipt tracking software options available that can help you manage receipts digitally. These tools allow you to upload receipts and categorize them, making it easier to track expenses and stay organized.",,finance,19670
How do online referal systems work?,"Yeah, I'll take the challenge...:) How trustworthy these are and what are their sources of income? These are in fact two separate questions, but the answers are related. How trustworthy? As trustworthy as they're clear about their own sources of income. If you cannot find any clue as to why, what for and how they're paying you - you probably should walk away. What's too good to be true usually is indeed too good to be true. For those of the sites that I know of their sources of income, it is usually advertisements and surveys. To get paid, you have to watch advertisements and/or answer surveys. I know of some sites who are legit, and pay people (not money, but gift cards, airline miles, etc) for participating in surveys. My own HMO (Kaiser in California) in fact pays (small amounts) to members who participate in enough surveys, so its legit. Are these sites worthwhile to consider for extra income? Not something you could live off, but definitely can get you enough gift cards for your weekly trip to Starbucks. What do I need to consider tax wise? Usually the amounts are very low, and are not paid in cash. While it is income, I doubt the IRS will chase you if you don't report the $20 Amazon gift card you got from there. It should, strictly speaking, be reported (probably as hobby income) on your tax return. Most people don't bother dealing with such small amounts though. In some cases (like the HMO I mentioned), its basically a rebate of the money paid (you pay your copays, deductibles etc. Since the surveys are only for members, you basically get your money back, not additional income). This is in fact similar to credit card rebates. Is there a best practice for handling the income? If we're talking about significant amounts (more than $20-30 a year), then you need to keep track of the income and related expenses, and report it as any other business income on your taxes, Schedule C. Is there a good test to determine what is and isn't a scam? As I said - if it looks too good to be true - it most likely is. If you're required to provide your personal/financial information without any explanation as to why, what it will be used for, and why and what for you're going to be paid - I'd walk away. Otherwise, you can also check Internet reviews, BBB ratings, FTC information and the relevant state agencies and consumer watchdogs (for example: http://www.scamadviser.com) whether they've heard of that particular site, and what is the information they have on it. A very good sign for a scam is contact information. Do they have a phone number to call to? Is it in your own country? If its not in your own country - definitely go away (for example the original link that was in the question pointed to a service whose phone number is in the UK, but listed address is in Los Angeles, CA. A clear sign of a scam). If they do have a phone number - try it, talk to them, call several times and see how many different people you're going to talk to. If its always the same person - run and hide. Do they have an address? If not - walk away. If they do - look it up. Is it a PMB/POB? A ""virtual"" office? Or do they have a proper office set up, which you can see on the map and in the listings as their office? And of course your guts. If your guts tell you its a scam - it very likely is.","Online referral systems are a way for businesses to incentivize their customers to refer their friends and family to the business. The basic idea is that the business will offer a reward or incentive to the customer for each successful referral they bring to the business.There are many ways that online referral systems can be implemented, but here are the basic steps:A customer signs up for the referral program and is given a unique referral code or link to share with their friends and family.The customer shares the referral code or link with their friends and family, either through social media, email, or by word of mouth.When someone clicks on the referral link or enters the referral code, they are directed to the business's website.If the person decides to make a purchase or take some other desired action (such as signing up for a newsletter), the referral system tracks that the referral came from the original customer.If the referral meets the criteria for a successful referral (for example, if the person makes a purchase), the original customer is rewarded with a discount, credit, or other incentive.Some referral systems also have multiple levels, where customers can earn even more rewards for each additional referral they bring in.

What is the effect of dividends on the futures price of an index,"A futures contract is based upon a particular delivery date.  In the case of a stock index futures contract is a cash settled futures contract based upon the stock index value at a particular point in time (i.e. this is when the final settlement is determined). In your example, the S&P 500 (SPX) is a price return index - that is, it is not affected by dividends and therefore dividends are not incorporated into the index value.  Dividends will affect the price of the constituent stocks (not necessarily by the same amount as the dividend) so they do have influence on the stock index value.  Since the dividends are known ahead of time (or at least can be estimated), this has already been factored into the futures price by the market. In terms of the impact of a dividend by AAPL, AAPL is approximaetely 3.6% of the index.  Apple pays out dividends 4 times a year (currently paying out $0.52 dividends).  Assuming the market is otherwise steady and AAPL drops by $0.52 due to the dividend and Apple is priced at around $105, this would result in a drop in the index of 0.0178% or around 0.35 points. Interesting fact:  There are some futures contracts that are based upon Total Return indexes, such as the German DAX and the above logic would need to be reversed.","Dividends can have an impact on the price of a futures contract for an index, but the extent of the impact will depend on the specifics of the index and the dividends being paid by the underlying constituents of the index.In general, dividends can have an impact on the price of a futures contract because they represent a transfer of value from the underlying index constituents to their shareholders. When a dividend is paid, the value of the underlying index constituents will generally decline by an amount equal to the value of the dividend being paid. This decline in value will be reflected in the price of the futures contract.However, the impact of dividends on the price of a futures contract may not be straightforward because futures contracts are based on the expectation of future prices, rather than current prices. The impact of dividends on the price of a futures contract will depend on how market participants expect the dividends to affect the future price of the underlying index constituents.For example, if market participants expect that the dividends will have a significant impact on the future price of the underlying index constituents, the price of the futures contract may decline more significantly to reflect this expectation. On the other hand, if market participants expect that the dividends will have a relatively small impact on the future price of the underlying index constituents, the price of the futures contract may only decline slightly to reflect this expectation.Overall, the impact of dividends on the price of a futures contract will depend on a variety of factors, including the specifics of the index and the dividends being paid by the underlying constituents of the index, as well as market expectations about the impact of those dividends on the future price of the underlying index constituents.",,finance,20618

What to do if a state and federal refund is denied direct deposit?,"Publication 17 Your Income Tax top of page 14 If the direct deposit cannot be done, the IRS will send a check instead. When your girlfriend gets the check, she can endorse it over to you for deposit into your account.","If your state and federal tax refunds have been denied for direct deposit, you will need to take action to receive your refund. Here are some steps you can take:Check for errors: First, check your tax return for errors. If you find any mistakes, you may need to file an amended return to correct the errors and resubmit it.Check the status of your refund: You can check the status of your federal tax refund using the IRS' ""Where's My Refund?"" tool, which is available on the IRS website. You can also check the status of your state tax refund by contacting your state's tax agency.Contact the IRS or your state's tax agency: If you cannot find any errors on your tax return and the status of your refund shows that it was denied for direct deposit, you should contact the IRS or your state's tax agency for further assistance.

"How long to wait before refinancing a high interest car loan, after improving credit history?","Between half a year and a year should be enough to improve your interest rates drastically on car loan refinance. Make sure that your new credit card has already been reported to the agencies, and that the credit/debt ratio is lower than 30% on your revolving (credit card) accounts. That also means that you shouldn't carry too much balance, even if the APR is 0%.","It's generally a good idea to wait until you have improved your credit score before refinancing a car loan. This is because lenders use your credit score to determine your creditworthiness and the interest rate you will be offered on a loan. A higher credit score can qualify you for a lower interest rate, which can save you money on your car loan.In general, it's a good idea to wait at least six months to a year before applying for refinancing, as this gives you time to make progress in improving your credit score. During this time, you should focus on paying your bills on time, paying down any outstanding debts, and avoiding taking on new debt. These actions can help improve your credit score and increase your chances of being approved for a lower interest rate when you apply for refinancing.It's also a good idea to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders before refinancing your car loan. This will help you find the best rate and terms available to you. You can use an online loan calculator to estimate your monthly payments under different interest rate scenarios, which can help you determine the best option for your situation.",,finance,21587
Is there a way to roll over short-term gains and avoid capital gain tax,"If the investments are in a non-retirement, taxable account, there's not much you can do to avoid short-term capital gains if you sell now. Ways to limit short-term capital gains taxes: Donate -- you can donate some of the stock to charity (before selling it). Transfer -- you can give some of the stock to, say, a family member in a lower tax bracket. But there are tons of rules, gift limits, and won't work for little kids or full time students. They would still pay taxes at their own rate. Protect your gains by buying puts. Wait it out until the long-term capital gains rate kicks in. This allows you to lock in your gains now (but you won't benefit from potential future appreciation.) Buying puts also costs $, so do the ROI calculation. (You could also sell a call and buy a put at the same time and lock in your gains for certain, but the IRS often looks at that as locking in the short-term capital gain, so be careful and talk to a tax professional if you are considering that method.) Die. There's a ""step-up"" basis on capital gains for estates. source: http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/30/avoid-capital-gains-tax-anschutz-personal-finance-baldwin-tax-strategy.html","Yes, it is possible to roll over short-term capital gains and avoid paying tax on them. One way to do this is by selling your investments that have short-term gains and then using the proceeds to buy similar investments within a certain time frame, typically 60 days. This is known as a ""tax-free rollover,"" or a ""like-kind exchange.""To qualify for a tax-free rollover, the assets you sell and the assets you buy must be similar or ""like-kind."" For example, you can sell stocks and use the proceeds to buy bonds, or sell a rental property and use the proceeds to buy a different rental property. However, you cannot sell stocks and use the proceeds to buy a car or other personal property.It's important to note that tax-free rollovers are only available for investments held for less than one year. If you have held your investments for longer than one year, any gains are considered long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.It's also worth noting that tax-free rollovers are not available for all types of investments. For example, you cannot use a tax-free rollover to avoid paying tax on the sale of a primary residence or other personal property.If you are considering using a tax-free rollover to avoid paying tax on short-term capital gains, it is important to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to ensure that you meet the requirements and to understand the potential risks and benefits.",,finance,23031
The Purpose of Change Machines ,"I think you're talking about two types of machines, at least in the United States. The term change  machine usually refers to a machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller bills or coins. Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency, in which case they are also often known as bill changers. Exactly what bills or coins these machines return depends on the machine. Read the instructions on the machine to get the details (they're usually right on the machine). For example my apartment building has a machine that converts small bills like ones and fives to quarters, since the laundry machines only took quarters. The other type of machine are coin-cashing machines, like the Coinstar machines you might see at a grocery store. Many banks used to have these machines as well although in my area they're few and far between now. These machines perform the opposite function of the traditional change machine and convert smaller denominations (mostly coins) into bill form. For example if you dump all your accumulated pennies into the machine, it will probably give you bills and larger coins like quarters, dimes, nickels in exchange, after subtracting a small fee. I've heard that now, some of these machines may give you a gift card of some kind instead of bills, although they'll still subtract a fee from your original amount, usually. Once again just read the instructions and they should tell you. When my bank had one of these machines, they didn't charge a fee as long as you were a customer at the bank. I'm sure that varies from place to place and bank to bank though. Wikipedia's article has this to say (see the article for references): In some sections of the U.S., regional banks have begun offering free coin-counting services in the amount of a gift card. Refunds are often given in cash rather than in the form of a gift card. In some cases, it is not even necessary for the customer to have an account at the bank; the free service is offered as a way to attract new business from individuals who are not current account holders. TD Bank's ""Penny Arcade"" coin counters were free and available to both customers and non-customers in many branches, but as of November 2010, the bank charges a 6% fee for non-customers to use the machine.","Change machines, also known as bill changers or bill breakers, are machines that dispense coins or bills in exchange for a larger denomination of currency. They are commonly found in places such as laundromats, amusement parks, and vending machine locations where it is convenient for customers to have smaller denominations of money for transactions.Change machines can be programmed to accept a variety of different denominations of bills and coins, and they typically dispense change in the form of smaller bills and coins. Some change machines also have the capability to accept credit or debit card payments and dispense change in the form of a printed receipt.Change machines are useful because they allow customers to easily obtain smaller denominations of currency without having to go to a bank or store to make a purchase. This can be particularly convenient for customers who may not have access to a bank or who need to make a small purchase but only have a large bill on hand.Overall, the purpose of change machines is to provide a convenient way for customers to obtain smaller denominations of currency for transactions.",,finance,21708
Can you sell on the settlement date?,"Yes, on the settlement the stock is yours to sell with no risk of freeride or day trading applying.","Yes, it is possible to sell on the settlement date. The settlement date is the date when a trade or transaction is completed and the exchange of assets or funds takes place. For example, if you are buying or selling a stock, the settlement date is the date when the ownership of the stock is transferred from the seller to the buyer, and the payment for the stock is transferred from the buyer to the seller.The settlement date is typically several business days after the trade is executed. This is known as the ""settlement period"" and is typically three business days for stocks traded on the U.S. exchanges. For example, if you place an order to buy or sell a stock on a Monday, the settlement date would be Thursday, assuming there are no holidays or other delays.It is important to be aware of the settlement date when buying or selling securities, as you will not be able to sell the securities or access the funds from the sale until the settlement date has passed.",,finance,19366
How would IRS treat reimbursement in a later year of moving expenses?,I believe moving reimbursement has to be counted as income no matter when you get it. I'd just put it under miscellaneous income with an explanation.,"If you are an employee and you are reimbursed by your employer for moving expenses that you incurred in a previous year, the reimbursement is generally taxable to you in the year you receive it. This is because the reimbursement is considered to be additional income to you, and it is subject to federal income tax and potentially other taxes such as Social Security and Medicare taxes.However, if you are self-employed and you are reimbursed for moving expenses that you incurred in a previous year, the reimbursement is generally not taxable to you. This is because the moving expenses were deductible in the year you incurred them, and the reimbursement is simply a repayment of those deductible expenses.It's important to keep in mind that in order to qualify for a tax deduction or exclusion for moving expenses, you must meet certain requirements. For example, you must have changed your job location, and the move must be related to the start of your new job. You should refer to IRS Publication 521, Moving Expenses, for more information on the rules for deducting or excluding moving expenses.",,finance,21633
Received an unexpected cashiers check for over $2K from another state - is this some scam?,"Some of these answers are actually wrong. Basically if you were to cash this cheque, you are committing bank fraud.  The cheque is usually fake and ends up with them cashing it off your account--this is how cheques work, when you cash a cheque, you are the one ultimately responsible for the validity of what you're cashing.  This is why large cheques are balanced against your active account--so what happens is they essentially just take money from you and leave you red handed.","It is possible that the cashier's check is part of a scam. There are several types of scams that involve cashier's checks, and it is important to be cautious if you receive one unexpectedly. Here are a few common scams that involve cashier's checks:Overpayment Scam: In this scam, the scammer will send you a cashier's check for more than the amount you were expecting, and then ask you to send them the difference. The scammer will often claim that the overpayment was an honest mistake, and ask you to wire the excess funds back to them. However, the cashier's check is often fake, and you will be left holding the bag when it bounces and you are unable to recover the funds you sent to the scammer.Lottery Scam: In this scam, the scammer will tell you that you have won a large sum of money, and will send you a cashier's check to cover the taxes or fees associated with the winnings. The scammer will then ask you to wire the funds back to them, or to send them personal or financial information. The cashier's check is often fake, and you will not receive the promised winnings.Employment Scam: In this scam, the scammer will send you a cashier's check as part of a fake job offer. The scammer will ask you to deposit the check and use the funds to purchase equipment or supplies for the job, or to send the funds back to them as part of a training or certification process. The cashier's check is often fake, and you will not receive the promised job or compensation.If you have received a cashier's check unexpectedly, it is important to be cautious and to verify the check before depositing it or sending any funds. You can do this by contacting the bank that issued the check and asking them to verify its authenticity. You can also contact the company or individual who sent the check and ask for more information about why it was sent. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of the check, it is best to err on the side of caution and not deposit it or send any funds.",,finance,19328

What is the 'real' monthly cost of a car?,"How can I find out what these 'additional' costs will be when looking to buy a car? If you know what model you're interested in buying you can try out Edmund's True Cost To Own calculator. This will estimate the depreciation, taxes and fees, financing costs, fuel costs, insurance premiums, maintenance, repairs, and any tax credits for owning a certain model for various periods of time. You can improve the accuracy be substituting your own calculations, like if you already have an insurance quote. Consumer Reports has a useful chart to demonstrate how much each of those additional costs will add up, percentage-wise. They also list the most and least expensive cars to own.","The ""real"" monthly cost of a car can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors, including the make and model of the car, its age and condition, the terms of the financing or lease agreement, and the cost of insurance and maintenance. Here are some of the key components that can contribute to the overall monthly cost of a car:Purchase price or lease payments: The amount you pay for the car itself can have a significant impact on your monthly costs. If you are financing the purchase of a car, your monthly payment will depend on the amount of the loan, the interest rate, and the loan term. If you are leasing a car, your monthly payment will depend on the terms of the lease agreement, including the length of the lease and the amount of the down payment.Financing or lease fees: In addition to the purchase price or lease payments, you may also have to pay financing or lease fees, such as an origination fee or a documentation fee. These fees can add to your overall monthly cost.Insurance: The cost of car insurance can vary widely depending on a variety of factors, including your age, the make and model of your car, your driving history, and where you live. It's important to shop around and compare quotes from different insurance companies to get the best rate.Maintenance and repairs: The cost of maintaining and repairing your car can vary depending on the make and model, as well as your driving habits and the condition of the car. It's important to budget for regular maintenance and be prepared for unexpected repairs.Fuel: The cost of fuel can also be a significant part of the overall monthly cost of owning a car. The fuel efficiency of your car, as well as the cost of gas in your area, can both impact your fuel costs.To get a better sense of the ""real"" monthly cost of a car, it can be helpful to create a budget that takes into account all of these factors and allows you to see exactly how much you are spending on your car each month.

"As a parent of a high school student, what should my short-term cash policy be to optimize my college costs?","There is no simple answer to your question.  It depends on many things, perhaps most notably what college your daughter ends up going to and what kind of aid you hope to receive. Your daughter will probably fill out the FAFSA as part of her financial aid application.  Here is one discussion of what parental assets ""count"" towards the Expected Family Contribution on the FAFSA.  You can find many similar pages by googling.  Retirement accounts and primary residence are notable categories that do not count.  So, if you were looking to reduce your ""apparent"" assets for aid purposes, dumping money into your mortgage or retirement account is a possibility. However, you should be cautious when doing this type of gaming, because it's not always clear exactly how it will affect financial aid.  For one thing, ""financial aid"" includes both grants and loans.  Everyone wants grants, but sometimes increasing your ""eligibility"" may just make you (or your daughter) eligible for larger loans, which may not be so great. Also, each college has its own system for allocating financial aid.  Individual schools may ask for more detailed information (such as the CSS Profile).  So strategies for minimizing your apparent assets that work for one school may not work for others.  Some elite schools with large endowments have generous aid policies that allow even families with sizable incomes to pay little or nothing (e.g., Stanford waives tuition for most families with incomes under $125,000). You should probably research the financial aid policies of schools your daughter is interested in.  It can be helpful to talk to financial aid advisors at colleges, as well as high school counselors, not to mention general financial advisors if you really want to start getting technical about what assets to move around.  Needless to say, it all begins with talking with your daughter about her thoughts on where to go.","There are a few things you can do to try to optimize the costs of college for your student:Start saving as early as possible: The earlier you start saving for college, the more time you have for your savings to grow through compound interest. This can help you to save more overall, which can reduce the amount of money you need to borrow or pay out of pocket.Research financial aid options: Many colleges and universities offer financial aid to help students pay for their education. This can include grants, scholarships, and loans. Research the financial aid options available at the colleges your student is interested in attending, and consider applying for as many as possible.Consider attending a community college: Community colleges often have significantly lower tuition costs than four-year colleges and universities. Your student could attend a community college for the first two years and then transfer to a four-year school to complete their degree, which could save you a significant amount of money.Look into work-study programs: Work-study programs allow students to work part-time on campus in exchange for a reduction in their tuition costs. This can be a good way for your student to help offset the cost of their education while also gaining valuable work experience.Consider taking out loans: If you don't have enough savings to cover the full cost of college, you may need to borrow money to help pay for it. There are a variety of loans available to help students pay for college, including federal student loans, private student loans, and parent loans. Be sure to research the different types of loans available and compare the terms and conditions before deciding which one is right for you.",,finance,20504
Can an unmarried couple buy a home together with only one person on the mortgage?,"There is no issue whatsoever, getting a mortgage this way as an unmarried couple. This is very similar to what I did while my wife and I were engaged. We we're on the title as joint tenants. I would expect them to have her as a signee to the mortgage.  She won't be able to claim 50% ownership and make things hard on the lender. The title will be contingent on the mortgage being paid. What will be harder is if you guys decide to split. It's not at all uncommon for unmarried couples to buy a house together. Find a broker and get their advice.","Yes, it is possible for an unmarried couple to buy a home together with only one person listed on the mortgage. This can be done through a variety of arrangements, such as having one partner act as a co-borrower or co-signer on the mortgage or having one partner provide the down payment and closing costs while the other partner pays rent or contributes to the monthly mortgage payments.However, it is important to carefully consider the terms of any such arrangement, as it can have significant legal and financial implications for both parties. For example, if one partner is listed on the mortgage but the other partner is not, the partner who is not listed on the mortgage may not have any legal ownership rights to the property. This could be problematic if the couple were to break up or if one partner were to pass away.It is also important to note that lenders typically consider both partners' credit histories and income when evaluating a mortgage application, even if only one partner is listed as the borrower. As a result, both partners' financial profiles may be taken into account when determining the mortgage terms and interest rate.It is generally a good idea for both partners to seek legal advice before entering into a co-ownership or co-borrowing arrangement for a home. A lawyer can help to ensure that the couple's rights and interests are protected and that any agreements are clearly documented and understood by both parties.",,finance,20421

However, whether or not this is a good idea depends on your individual circumstances.There are a few things to consider when deciding whether to sell your home with owner financing:Your financial situation: Are you in a position to carry the mortgage on the property until it is paid off by the buyer? If not, you may want to consider other options for selling your home.The buyer's financial situation: Is the buyer creditworthy and able to make regular payments on the mortgage? If not, you may be taking on unnecessary risk by offering owner financing.The terms of the sale: Make sure to clearly define the terms of the sale, including the interest rate, payment schedule, and any penalties for late or missed payments.The risks involved: As the seller, you will be taking on the risk of carrying the mortgage until it is paid off. If the buyer defaults on their payments, you will be responsible for repossessing the property and finding a new buyer.In summary, selling your home with owner financing can be a good option if you are in a strong financial position, the buyer is creditworthy, and the terms of the sale are clearly defined.

Credit card transactions for personal finances,"Other responses have focused on getting you software to use, but I'd like to attempt your literal question: how are such transactions managed in systems that handle them? I will answer for ""double entry"" bookkeeping software such as Quicken or GnuCash (my choice). (Disclaimer: I Am Not An Accountant and accountants will probably find error in my terminology.) Your credit card is a liability to you, and is tracked using a liability account (as opposed to an asset account, such as your bank accounts or cash in your pocket). A liability account is just like an asset except that it is subtracted from rather than added to your total assets (or, from another perspective, its balance is normally negative; the mathematics works out identically). When you make a purchase using your credit card, the transaction you record transfers money from the liability account (increasing the liability) to the expense account for your classification of the expense. When you make a payment on your credit card, the transaction you record transfers money from your checking account (for example) to the credit card account, reducing the liability. Whatever software you choose for tracking your money, I strongly recommend choosing something that is sufficiently powerful to handle representing this as I have described (transfers between accounts as the normal mode of operation, not simply lone increases/decreases of asset accounts).","Credit cards can be a convenient and safe way to pay for purchases, as well as a useful tool for managing your personal finances. Here are a few tips for using credit cards effectively for your personal finances:Pay your balance in full each month: To avoid paying interest on your credit card purchases, it's important to pay your balance in full each month. This will help you avoid accumulating debt, which can be expensive and difficult to pay off.Choose a card with rewards that align with your spending: If you're going to use a credit card for everyday expenses, it can be beneficial to choose a card that offers rewards for the types of purchases you make most frequently. For example, if you frequently travel, a credit card with travel rewards may be a good choice.Monitor your credit card activity: It's important to regularly review your credit card statements to ensure that all of the charges are accurate. This will help you catch any fraudulent activity or mistakes as soon as possible, so you can report them to your credit card issuer.Use your credit card wisely: Avoid using your credit card to make impulsive or unnecessary purchases, and try to pay off your balance as soon as possible to avoid accumulating debt. It's also a good idea to avoid using your credit card to withdraw cash from an ATM, as this often carries higher fees and interest rates.By following these tips, you can use your credit card to manage your personal finances effectively and avoid falling into debt.",,finance,20859

How to record a written put option in double-entry accounting?,"Because you've sold something you've received cash (or at least an entry on your brokerage statement to say you've got cash) so you should record that as a credit in your brokerage account in GnuCash. The other side of the entry should go into another account that you create called something like ""Open Positions"" and is usually marked as a Liability account type (if you need to mark it as such). If you want to keep an accurate daily tally of your net worth you can add a new entry to your Open Positions account and offset that against Income which will be either negative or positive depending on how the position has moved for/against you. You can also do this at a lower frequency or not at all and just put an entry in when your position closes out because you bought it back or it expired or it was exercised. My preferred method is to have a single entry in the Open Positions account with an arbitrary date near when I expect it to be closed and each time I edit that value (daily or weekly) so I only have the initial entry and the current adjust to look at which reduces the number of entries and confusion if there are too many.","To record a written put option in double-entry accounting, you need to follow these steps:Determine the amount of cash that you will receive for writing the put option. This is the premium that the put option buyer pays to you for taking on the risk of potentially having to purchase the underlying asset at the strike price.Record a debit to the cash account and a credit to the options revenue account for the premium received. This increases the cash balance and records the revenue earned from writing the put option.Determine the underlying asset that you have agreed to potentially purchase at the strike price.Record a liability for the potential obligation to purchase the underlying asset at the strike price. This can be recorded in a separate account such as ""put option liability,"" or as a sub-account under a broader category such as ""derivative liabilities.""If the put option is exercised and you are required to purchase the underlying asset at the strike price, record a debit to the put option liability account and a credit to the cash account for the amount paid to purchase the underlying asset. This reduces the put option liability and decreases the cash balance.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",,finance,22162
Taking Losses To Save On Tax,"No, if you are taking a loss solely and purely to reduce the tax you have to pay, then it is not a good strategy, in fact it is a very bad strategy, no matter what country you are in. No investment choice should be made solely due to your tax consequeses. If you are paying tax that means you made a profit, if you made a loss just to save some tax then you are loosing money. The whole point of investing is to make money not lose it.","There are a few strategies that individuals and businesses can use to save on taxes by taking losses. Here are a few examples:Businesses can offset profits with losses: If a business has a profitable year and a loss in another year, they can offset the profits with the losses to reduce their overall tax liability.Individuals can use capital losses to offset capital gains: If an individual has realized capital gains from the sale of assets, they can use capital losses to offset those gains and reduce their overall tax liability.Businesses and individuals can carry losses forward or backward: In some cases, businesses and individuals can carry losses forward or backward to offset income in future or past tax years.It's important to note that these strategies may be subject to certain limitations and restrictions, and it's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional to understand how these strategies may apply to your specific situation.",,finance,23018
Why are american call options more valuable than european options ONLY if the underlying asset pays cash flows?,"Really all you need to know is that American style can be exercised at any point, European options cannot be exercised early. Read on if you want more detail.  The American style Call is worth more because it can be exercised at any point. And when the company pays a dividend, and your option is in the money, if the extrinsic value is worth less than the dividend you can be exercised early. This is not the case for a European call. You cannot be exercised until expiration. I trade a lot of options, you wont be exercised early unless the dividend scenario I mentioned happens. Or unless the extrinsic value is nothing, but even then, unless the investor really wants that position, he is more likely to just sell the call for an equivalent gain on 100 shares of stock.","American call options are generally considered to be more valuable than European call options because they give the holder the right to exercise the option at any time prior to expiration. This means that the holder of an American call option can choose to exercise the option and receive the underlying asset at the strike price at any point before the option expires, while the holder of a European call option can only exercise the option at expiration.The ability to exercise an option at any time can be especially valuable if the underlying asset pays cash flows, such as dividends or interest payments, because these cash flows can increase the value of the option. For example, if an investor holds a call option on a stock that pays dividends, and the stock's price is below the strike price of the option, the investor may choose to exercise the option and receive the stock before the dividend payment is made. This allows the investor to capture the value of the dividend payment and potentially sell the stock for a profit.In general, the value of an option is determined by a number of factors, including the underlying asset's price, the option's strike price, the option's expiration date, the underlying asset's volatility, and the time remaining until expiration. All of these factors can affect the value of an option, and the specific impact of each factor will depend on the specific circumstances of the option.",,finance,20318
What evidence is there that rising interest rates causes Canadian condo prices to go down?,"In general, prices are inversely proportional to rates; however, accurate interest rate prediction would make one worthy of managing a large credit derivative hedge fund. This is not to say that interest rates cannot go up in Canada since the world is currently undergoing a resource bust, and the United States has begun exporting more oil, even trying to recently open the market to Europe, both of which Canada is relatively dependent upon. Also, to say that Canada currently has the most overpriced real estate is an oversight to say the least considering China currently has entire cities that are empty because prices are too high. A ten to twenty percent drop in real estate prices would probably be a full blown financial crisis, and since mortgage rates are currently around 2.5%, a one to two hundred basis point rise could mean a nearly 50% decrease in real estate prices if interest payments are held constant.  Canada would either have to start growing its economy at a much higher rate to encourage the central bank to raise rates to such a height, or oil would have to completely collapse suddenly to cause a speculatively possible collapse of CAD to encourage the same. The easiest relationship to manipulate between prices and rates is the perpetuity: where p is the price, i is the interest payment, and r is the interest rate.  In this case, an increase of r from 2.5% to 4.5% would cause a 44.5% decrease in p if i is held constant.  However, typical Canadian mortgages seem to mature in ten years at a fixed rate, so i cannot be held constant, and the relationship between r and p is less strong at earlier maturities, thus the most likely way for prices to collapse is for a financial collapse as described above.","It is generally believed that rising interest rates can have a negative effect on the housing market, including the condominium market, in Canada and other countries. When interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing money to purchase a home or condominium may also increase, which can make it more difficult for potential buyers to afford a home or condo. As a result, demand for housing may decrease, leading to a decline in prices.There have been several studies and analyses that have found a negative relationship between rising interest rates and housing prices in Canada. For example, a study published in the Canadian Real Estate Association's REALTORS® Association of Canada Housing Digest in 2013 found that higher interest rates were associated with lower housing prices in Canada.Additionally, the Bank of Canada, which sets the benchmark interest rate for the country, has noted that changes in interest rates can affect the housing market. In a research paper published in 2017, the bank found that changes in interest rates can have a significant impact on the demand for and supply of housing, as well as on housing prices.Overall, while there is evidence to suggest that rising interest rates can negatively impact the housing market, including the condominium market, it is important to note that other factors, such as economic conditions, demographics, and government policies, can also influence housing prices.",,finance,20993
Why does financial investor bother to buy derivatives and then hedge the position?,There are a number reasons to hedge a position.  Here are some of the more common:,"Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset, such as a stock, bond, commodity, or currency. Investors may buy derivatives for a variety of reasons, including to hedge their portfolio against potential losses, to speculate on the movement of an underlying asset, or to generate additional income through the sale of derivatives to other investors.Hedging is a risk management strategy that involves taking offsetting positions in financial instruments in order to reduce the risk of loss from an adverse market movement. By hedging their positions, investors can protect themselves from potential losses that may occur if the underlying asset moves in an unexpected direction.For example, an investor who is long on a particular stock may buy a put option on that stock as a hedge. If the stock price falls, the put option will increase in value, offsetting some of the losses from the decline in the stock price. On the other hand, if the stock price rises, the investor will still benefit from the increase in the stock price, but the cost of the put option will offset some of the gains. In this way, hedging can help investors manage the risk in their portfolio and potentially increase the overall return on their investments.",,finance,21732
"When shorting a stock, do you pay current market price or the best (lowest) available ask price?","I would never use a market order.  Some brokerages have an approval process your short-sale goes through before going to market.  This can take some time.  So the market prices may well be quite different later. Some brokerages use a separate account for short sales, so you must get their approval for the account before you can do the trade.   I like the listing of shares available for shorting the Interactive Brokers has but I have experienced orders simply going into dead-air and sitting there on the screen, not being rejected, not going to market, not doing anything --- even though the shares are on the list.","When you short a stock, you borrow shares from someone else and sell them on the market. You are selling the shares at the current market price. The ask price is the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell a particular stock. If you want to sell a stock that you own, you would sell it at the ask price. However, when you short a stock, you are borrowing the shares and selling them, so you are not selling at the ask price. Instead, you are selling at the current market price, which may be higher or lower than the ask price.For example, let's say that the current market price for a particular stock is $100, and the best (lowest) ask price is $99. If you want to sell a stock that you own, you would sell it at the ask price of $99. However, if you want to short the stock, you would borrow shares of the stock and sell them at the current market price of $100. You would then need to repurchase the shares at a later date to close the short position.",,finance,19816
Sell your home and invest in growth stock mutual fund,"The 20%+ returns you have observed in the mutual funds are not free money.  They are compensation for the risk associated with owning those funds.  Given the extraordinarily high returns you are seeing I would expect extremely high risk.  This means there is a good possibility of extreme losses at some point.  By putting a lot of money in those mutual funds you are taking a gamble that may or may not pay off. Assuming what your friend is paying you for rent is fair, you are not losing money on your house relative to the market.  You are earning less because you are invested in a less risky asset.  If you want a higher return, you should borrow some money (or sell your house) and invest in the market.  You may make more money that way. But if you do that, you will have a larger chance of losing a lot of money at some point.  That's the way risk works.  No one can promise a 20% return on a risky asset, they can only hint that it may do in the future what it did in the past. A reasonable approach to investment is to get invested in lots of different things: stocks, bonds, real estate.  If you are afraid of risk and willing to earn less, keep more money in safe assets.  If you are willing to take big risks in exchange for the possibility of high returns, move more assets into risky stuff.  If you want extreme returns and are willing to take extreme risk, borrow and use the money to invest in risky assets. As you look over investment options, remember that anything that pays high returns most likely has high risk as well.","Selling a home and investing the proceeds in a growth stock mutual fund can be a good strategy for some people, but it's important to carefully consider your financial goals and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.

It's important to understand the potential risks and rewards before making an investment.Consider other investment options: While growth stock mutual funds can be a good investment for some people, they may not be the best fit for everyone. It's important to consider all of your investment options and choose one that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.Consult with a financial advisor: If you're unsure about whether selling your home and investing in a growth stock mutual fund is the right decision for you, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

That “write your own mortgage” thing; how to learn about it,"You are asking about a common, simple practice of holding the mortgage when selling a house you own outright. Typically called seller financing.  Say I am 70 and wish to downsize. The money I sell my house for will likely be in the bank at today's awful rates. Now, a buyer likes my house, and has 20% down, but due to some medical bills for his deceased wife, he and his new wife are struggling to get financing. I offer to let them pay me as if I were the bank. We agree on the rate, I have a lien on the house just as a bank would, and my mortgage with them requires the usual fire, theft, vandalism insurance. When I die, my heirs will get the income, or the buyer can pay in full after I'm gone.  In response to comment ""how do you do that? What's the paperwork?"" Fellow member @littleadv has often posted ""You need to hire a professional."" Not because the top members here can't offer great, accurate advice. But because a small mistake on the part of the DIY attempt can be far more costly than the relative cost of a pro.

Buying my first car: why financing is cheaper than paying cash here and now?,"The advice given at this site is to get approved for a loan from your bank or credit union before visiting the dealer. That way you have one data point in hand.  You know that your bank will loan w dollars at x rate for y months with a monthly payment of Z. You know what level you have to negotiate to in order to get a better deal from the dealer. The dealership you have visited has said  Excludes tax, tag, registration and dealer fees. Must finance through   Southeast Toyota Finance with approved credit. The first part is true. Most ads you will see exclude tax, tag, registration. Those amounts are set by the state or local government, and will be added by all dealers after the final price has been negotiated. They will be exactly the same if you make a deal with the dealer across the street. The phrase Must finance through company x is done because they want to make sure the interest and fees for the deal stay in the family. My fear is that the loan will also not be a great deal. They may have a higher rate, or longer term, or hit you with many fee and penalties if you want to pay it off early. Many dealers want to nudge you into financing with them, but the unwillingness to negotiate on price may mean that there is a short term pressure on the dealership to do more deals through Toyota finance. Of course the risk for them is that potential buyers just take their business a few miles down the road to somebody else. If they won't budge from the cash price, you probably want to pick another dealer. If the spread between the two was smaller, it is possible that the loan from your bank at the cash price might still save more money compared to the dealer loan at their quoted price. We can't tell exactly because we don't know the interest rates of the two offers. A couple of notes regarding other dealers. If you are willing to drive a little farther when buying the vehicle, you can still go to the closer dealer for warranty work. If you don't need a new car, you can sometimes find a deal on a car that is only a year or two old at a dealership that sells other types of cars. They got the used car as a trade-in.","There are a few reasons why financing a car may be cheaper than paying for it in cash upfront.First, when you finance a car, you may be able to take advantage of lower interest rates, which can help reduce the overall cost of the loan. This is especially true if you have a good credit score, as lenders will generally offer more favorable terms to borrowers with higher credit scores.Second, financing a car allows you to spread the cost of the vehicle over a longer period of time, which can make it more manageable from a budget perspective. This is especially true if you don't have a large sum of cash on hand to pay for the car upfront.Finally, financing a car may allow you to use the cash you have on hand for other expenses or investments, rather than tying it up in a single purchase. This can help you diversify your assets and potentially generate additional income over time.It's worth noting that financing a car does come with some additional costs, such as interest charges and potentially other fees, so it's important to carefully consider all of the costs involved before making a decision. It may also be a good idea to shop around and compare offers from different lenders to find the best deal.",,finance,20992
Optimize return of dividends based on payout per share,"The term you're looking for is yield (though it's defined the other way around from your ""payout efficiency"", as dividend / share price, which makes no substantive difference). You're simply saying that you want to buy high-yield shares, which is a common investment strategy. But you have to consider that often a high-yielding share has a reason for the high yield. You probably don't want to buy shares in a company whose current yield is 10% but will go into liquidation next year.","To optimize the return on dividends, you can follow these steps:Determine your investment goals and risk tolerance: Your investment goals and risk tolerance will help you determine how much of your portfolio should be invested in dividend-paying stocks. For example, if you are looking for a steady stream of income and are willing to take on more risk, you may want to allocate a larger portion of your portfolio to dividend-paying stocks.Research potential investments: Look for companies with a track record of steady or growing dividends. Consider factors such as the company's financial stability, growth prospects, and management quality. You can also look for companies with a high dividend yield, which is the annual dividend per share divided by the stock price.Diversify your portfolio: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio by investing in a variety of dividend-paying stocks in different sectors and industries. This will help reduce risk and increase the chances of earning a steady stream of income.Monitor your investments: Keep track of your investments and the dividends they are paying. Be aware of any changes in the company's financial performance or dividend policy, as this could affect your return on dividends.Review your portfolio regularly: Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. If necessary, make adjustments to optimize your return on dividends.It's important to note that investing in stocks carries risks, and you should always do your due diligence before making any investment decisions. It's also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional for personalized advice.",,finance,22604
How to buy out one person's share of a jointly owned vehicle with the lowest taxes and fees,"You should be able to refinance the vehicle and have the financing in just your name (assuming you can secure the financing). Since you are already on the vehicle registration, this would not constitute a sale, and thus would not incur additional sales tax.

What does “Yield Curve” mean?,"Yield is the term used to describe how much income the bond will generate if the bond was purchased at a particular moment in time. If I pay $100 for a one year, $100 par value bond that pays 5% interest then the bond yields 5% since I will receive $5 from a $100 investment if I held the bond to maturity. If I pay $90 for the same one year bond then the bond yields 17% since I will receive $15 from a $90 investment if I held the bond to maturity. There are many factors that affect what yield creditors will accept: It is the last bullet that ultimately determines yield.  The other factors feed into the creditor’s desire to hold money today versus receiving money in the future.  I desire money in my hand more than a promise to receive money in the future.  In order to entice me to lend my money someone must offer me an incentive.  Thus, they must offer me more money in the future in order for me to part with money I have. A yield curve is a snapshot of the yields for different loan durations.  The x-axis is the amount of time left on the bond while the y-axis is the yield.  The most cited yield curve is the US treasury curve which displays the yields for loans to the US government.  The yield curve changes while bonds are being traded thus it is always a snapshot of a particular moment in time. Short term loans typically have less yield than longer term loans since there is less uncertainty about the near future. Yield curves will flatten or slightly invert when creditors desire to keep their money instead of loaning it out.  This can occur because of a sudden disruption in the market that causes uncertainty about the future which leads to an increase in the demand for cash on hand. The US government yield curve should be looked at with some reservation however since there is a very large creditor to the US government that has the ability to loan the government an unlimited amount of funds.","A yield curve is a graph that plots the yields of fixed-income securities, such as bonds, with different maturities. The curve shows the relationship between the yield (the interest rate earned on an investment) and the time to maturity of the investment. Typically, the yield on longer-term securities is higher than the yield on shorter-term securities because investors demand a higher return to compensate for the additional risk of holding an investment for a longer period of time.The shape of the yield curve can provide important information about the direction of interest rates and the overall state of the economy. A normal yield curve is upward sloping, meaning that the yield on longer-term securities is higher than the yield on shorter-term securities. An inverted yield curve occurs when the yield on shorter-term securities is higher than the yield on longer-term securities. An inverted yield curve can be a sign of economic uncertainty or an impending recession.There are several types of yield curves, including the Treasury yield curve, which plots the yields of U.S. government bonds with different maturities, and the corporate yield curve, which plots the yields of corporate bonds with different maturities. Yield curves are often used by investors and financial analysts to assess the risk and return of different investments and to make decisions about asset allocation.",,finance,21173
How do credit card payments work? What ensures the retailer charges the right amount?,"Your credit card limit is nothing more than a simple number.  When you purchase something, the merchant receives a number (i.e. the amount of the transaction) from your card company (e.g. Visa) in their bank account, and that number is subtracted from your limit (added to your balance). The amount is recorded, and isn't changed, so that's how they get the ""exact"" amount you paid.  Transferring a number is easier than the retailer having to wait for cash to get from you to your card company to them.  Moving numbers around is the basis of the modern financial system. And yes, it is always a risk to let someone else have your credit card number.  An untrustworthy company/person may use it to charge you without your permission, or if they have your full details they could use it as if they were you.  With a reputable retailer like Amazon, the main risk is data theft: If a security hole is found in Amazon's system, someone could steal your credit card info and misuse it.","When you make a purchase with a credit card, the retailer will charge a specific amount to your credit card account. This amount is typically determined by the cost of the items you are purchasing, plus any applicable taxes and fees.To process the payment, the retailer will use a credit card terminal or a point-of-sale system that is connected to a credit card processor. The processor will verify that your credit card has sufficient funds available to cover the purchase, and then it will transfer the funds from your credit card account to the retailer's bank account.To ensure that the retailer charges the correct amount, the terminal or point-of-sale system will typically display the amount of the purchase before you confirm the payment. You can verify that this amount is correct and make any necessary adjustments before completing the payment. Additionally, you will receive a receipt for the transaction, which will show the amount charged to your credit card. You can use this receipt to verify that the correct amount was charged to your account.",,finance,23072
gift is taxable but is “loan” or “debt” taxable?,"The difference is whether or not you have a contract that stipulates the payment plan, interest, and late payment penalties. If you have one then the IRS treats the transaction as a load/loan servicing. If not the IRS sees the money transfer as a gift.","In the United States, gifts are generally not taxable to the recipient. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if the gift is in the form of property, the recipient may be required to pay capital gains tax on the appreciation in value of the property when it is sold.Loans and debts are generally not taxable, unless they are forgiven or discharged. In such cases, the forgiven or discharged amount may be considered taxable income to the borrower. For example, if a borrower takes out a loan and is later forgiven a portion of the debt, the forgiven amount may be considered taxable income to the borrower. However, this will depend on the specific circumstances and may be subject to certain exclusions or exemptions.It's important to note that the rules for taxes on gifts, loans, and debts can be complex and may vary depending on the specific circumstances and the jurisdiction in which they are made or received. If you have specific questions about the tax treatment of a gift, loan, or debt, it is recommended that you consult a tax professional or refer to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for more information.",,finance,22840
What are “headwinds” and “tailwinds” in financial investments?,"Headwinds in an economic situation represent events or conditions e.g. a credit crisis, rising costs, natural disasters, etc, that slow down the growth of an economy. So headwinds are negative. Tailwinds are the opposite and help to increase growth of an economy.","In the context of financial investments, ""headwinds"" refer to negative factors that can potentially hinder the performance of an investment. These may include economic conditions, regulatory changes, market trends, or other external factors that can work against the investment. For example, if a company's stock is facing headwinds due to declining sales or increasing competition, it may be more difficult for the stock to perform well.On the other hand, ""tailwinds"" are positive factors that can potentially boost the performance of an investment. These may include favorable economic conditions, regulatory changes, market trends, or other external factors that can work in favor of the investment. For example, if a company's stock is benefiting from tailwinds such as strong demand for its products or a favorable regulatory environment, it may be more likely to perform well.It's important to note that headwinds and tailwinds can be both macro-level and specific to a particular investment or industry. Investors should consider both headwinds and tailwinds when making investment decisions, as they can have a significant impact on the potential risk and return of an investment.",,finance,21353
Separated spouse filed for SNAP benefits as single. Does this affect ability to file taxes jointly?,"The IRS isn't going to care how you filed for benefits - they're effectively the high man on the totem pole.  The agency that administers the SNAP program is the one who might care.  File the 1040 correctly, and then deal with SNAP as you note.  Do deal with SNAP, though; otherwise they might be in trouble if SNAP notices the discrepancy in an audit of their paperwork. Further, SNAP doesn't necessarily care here either.  SNAP defines a household as the people who live together in a house and share expenses; a separated couple who neither shared expenses nor lived together would not be treated as a single household, and thus one or both would separately qualify.  See this Geeks on Finance article or this Federal SNAP page for more details; and ask the state program administrator.  It may well be that this has no impact for him/her.  The details are complicated though, particularly when it comes to joint assets (which may still be joint even if they're otherwise separated), so look it over in detail, and talk to the agency to attempt to correct any issues. Note that depending on the exact circumstances, your friend might have another option other than Married Filing Jointly.  If the following are true: Then she may file as ""Head of Household"", and her (soon-to-be) ex would file as ""Married Filing Separately"", unless s/he also has dependents which would separately allow filing as Head of Household.  See the IRS document on Filing Status for more details, and consider consulting a tax advisor, particularly if she qualifies to consult one for free due to lower income.","Whether or not you are able to file your taxes jointly with your separated spouse depends on your marital status as of the last day of the tax year. If you were married as of December 31st of the tax year in question, you may be able to file a joint tax return with your spouse. However, if you were legally separated or divorced as of December 31st, you would not be able to file a joint tax return.It is worth noting that whether or not your separated spouse has filed for SNAP benefits, or any other benefits, would not affect your ability to file a joint tax return. The determination of your marital status on December 31st of the tax year is what is relevant for tax filing purposes.It is important to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of filing a joint tax return with a separated spouse, as there are potential risks and liabilities involved. It is a good idea to consult with a tax professional or attorney to help you understand your options and make the best decision for your situation.",,finance,20566
How can I calculate the volatility(standard deviation) of a stock price? and/or ROI (return on investment) of a stock?,"ROI and volatility should be calculated over a representative period of time, for example 3 or 5 years, depending on data availability.  The ROI is simple, for example, over 5 years:- For the 5 year annualised volatility you can refer to the ESMA SRRI methodology. Box 1 (page 3)  m is the annualisation factor. Stock volatility calculated from weekly data should not be compared with volatility calculated from monthly data. Also, for reference: How to Calculate your Portfolio's Rate of Return","To calculate the volatility (standard deviation) of a stock price, you can follow these steps:Collect the historical price data for the stock. You can find this information on financial websites or by downloading it from the stock exchange where the stock is traded.Calculate the daily return for each day by subtracting the previous day's closing price from the current day's closing price, and then dividing the result by the previous day's closing price.Calculate the average daily return by taking the sum of all the daily returns and dividing by the number of days in the data set.Calculate the variance by taking the sum of the squares of the differences between each daily return and the average daily return, and then dividing by the number of days in the data set.Calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.To calculate the return on investment (ROI) of a stock, you can use the following formula:ROI = (current value of investment - initial cost of investment) / initial cost of investmentFor example, if you bought a stock for $100 and it is now worth $150, your ROI would be:ROI = (150 - 100) / 100 = 0.50, or 50%This means that your investment has increased in value by 50%.It's important to note that ROI is just one measure of the performance of an investment, and there are many other factors that can affect the value of a stock. Additionally, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, so it's important to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards of any investment before making a decision.",,finance,21340
Is there a correlation between self-employment and wealth?,"Many studies show that the wealthiest households are self employed and small business owners. But there is significant risk associated, and so the wealth cannot really be enjoyed.","There is no simple answer to this question, as the relationship between self-employment and wealth can vary significantly depending on a number of factors. Some self-employed individuals may be able to earn a high income and accumulate significant wealth, while others may struggle to make ends meet.One factor that can affect the relationship between self-employment and wealth is the type of work that an individual does. Some self-employed individuals, such as highly skilled professionals or successful business owners, may be able to earn a high income and accumulate significant wealth. On the other hand, self-employed individuals who work in low-paying or unstable industries may have difficulty making a sufficient income to support themselves and their families.Another factor that can impact the relationship between self-employment and wealth is the level of risk that an individual is willing to take. Some self-employed individuals may be willing to take on more risk in order to potentially earn higher returns, while others may prefer a more stable, lower-risk approach.In general, it is important to note that self-employment can be a rewarding and fulfilling career choice, but it also carries its own set of risks and challenges. As with any career choice, it is important for individuals to carefully consider their goals, skills, and personal circumstances before deciding whether self-employment is the right path for them.",,finance,22963
"Is the contribution towards Employment Insurance (EI) wasted if I never get fired, or are my premiums refunded?","I would suggest they are not wasted because your premiums fund unemployment insurance, which is a net to prevent people from going under if they lose their jobs. Unemployment insurance is in many ways an incubator for success because it allows an entrepreneur to take more risk in starting a business because failure won't mean devastation. Perhaps that person who took the risk because of the ability to fail started the business that you now work for. Society works better (in my opinion) by keeping the bottom closer to the top.  Paying into the unemployment insurance fund indirectly provides you opportunity.","If you are a worker in Canada who is required to pay Employment Insurance (EI) premiums, you are entitled to receive EI benefits if you lose your job through no fault of your own, such as due to layoffs or downsizing, or if you become sick, pregnant, or injured and are unable to work.If you are not eligible to receive EI benefits because you have not lost your job or are not otherwise unable to work, your EI premiums will not be refunded. However, you will still have contributed to the EI program, which helps to provide income support to workers who are unable to work due to certain circumstances.It is important to note that EI premiums are not a form of insurance in the traditional sense. They are a form of tax that is used to fund the EI program, which provides income support to workers who are unable to work due to certain circumstances. Therefore, even if you do not personally receive EI benefits, your contributions to the program help to support others who may need them.",,finance,20250
Meaning of capital market,"1) Are the definitions for capital market from the two sources the same? Yes.  They are from two different perspectives.  Investopedia is looking at it primarily from the perspective of a trader and they lead-off with the secondary market. This refers to the secondary market: A market in which individuals and institutions trade financial securities. This refers to the primary market: Organizations/institutions in the public and private sectors also often sell securities on the capital markets in order to raise funds. Also, the Investopedia definition leaves much to be desired, but it is supposed to be pithy.  So, you are comparing apples and oranges, to some extent.  One is an article, as short as it may be, this other one is an entry in a dictionary. 2) What is the opposite of capital market, according to the definition in investopedia?  It's not quite about opposites, this is not physics.  However, that is not the issue here.  The Investopedia definition simply does not mention any other possibilities.  The Wikipedia article defines the term more thoroughly.  It talks about primary/secondary markets in separate paragraph. 3) According to the Wikipedia's definition, why does stock market belong to capital market, given that stocks can be held less than one year too? If you follow the link in the Wikipedia article to money market: As money became a commodity, the money market is nowadays a component of the financial markets for assets involved in short-term borrowing, lending, buying and selling with original maturities of one year or less. The key here is original maturities of one year or less. Here's my attempt at explaining this: Financial markets are comprised of money markets and capital markets.   Money is traded as if it were a commodity on the money markets.  Hence, the short-term nature in its definition.  They are more focused on the money itself.     Capital markets are focused on the money as a means to an end. Companies seek money in these markets for longer terms in order to improve their business in some way. A business may go to the money markets to access money quickly in order to deal with a short-term cash crunch.  Meanwhile, a business may go to the capital markets to seek money in order to expand its business. Note that capital markets came first and money markets are a relatively recent development.   Also, we are typically speaking about the secondary (capital) market when we are talking about the stock or bond market.  In this market, participants are merely trading among themselves.  The company that sought money by issuing that stock/bond certificate is out of the picture at that point and has its money.   So, Facebook got its money from participants in the primary market: the underwriters.  The underwriters then turned around and sold that stock in an IPO to the secondary market.  After the IPO, their stock trades on the secondary market where you or I have access to trade it.  That money flows between traders.  Facebook got its money at the ""beginning"" of the process.","The capital market is a financial market in which long-term debt or equity-backed securities are bought and sold. It is a market for securities that are not backed by physical assets and are typically issued by governments, municipalities, and corporations.The capital market includes a wide range of securities, such as stocks, bonds, and other debt instruments. It is distinct from the money market, which is a market for short-term debt instruments with maturities of one year or less.The capital market plays a crucial role in the allocation of capital within an economy. It provides companies with a way to raise funds to finance their operations and growth, and it allows investors to earn a return on their investments by providing capital to these companies.There are two main types of capital markets: the primary market, where new securities are issued, and the secondary market, where securities that have already been issued are bought and sold. The primary market is where companies and governments raise capital by issuing new securities, while the secondary market is where investors can buy and sell securities that have already been issued.",,finance,22640
What is the best way to stay risk neutral when buying a house with a mortgage?,"You can hedge your house price from losing value if you believe that the housing market is correlated with major stock indices. Speak with a commodities broker because they will be able to help you buy puts on stock indices which if correlated with housing prices will offer somewhat of a hedge. Example. House prices drop 30% because of weak economy, stocks will generally drop around that same amount 30%. If you have enough exposure to in the puts compared to your house value you will be protected. You can also buy calls in 30 year bonds for interest rate lock if you are not on a fixed interest rate. Many investors like warren buffet and carl icahn have been protecting them selves from a potential market downward turn. Speak to a local commodity broker to get some detailed advice, not etrade or any discount brokers they won't be able to help you specialize your trades. look for a full time commodity broker house.","To stay risk neutral when buying a house with a mortgage, you can follow these steps:Research the housing market: Look at the trends in the local housing market and consider factors such as economic conditions, population growth, and job market. This will help you understand whether it's a good time to buy a house in the area.Determine your budget: Calculate how much you can afford to spend on a house, including the costs of the mortgage, closing costs, and any repairs or renovations that may be needed.Shop around for a mortgage: Compare mortgage rates and terms from multiple lenders to find the best deal. Consider factors such as the interest rate, fees, and the length of the loan.Protect yourself with insurance: Make sure you have sufficient insurance coverage for your home, including homeowners insurance and mortgage protection insurance.Consider a fixed-rate mortgage: A fixed-rate mortgage offers stability, as the interest rate remains the same throughout the loan term. This can be a good option if you plan to stay in the house for a long time.Be prepared for unexpected expenses: Set aside funds for unexpected expenses that may come up, such as repairs or renovations. This will help you stay financially stable if unexpected costs arise.",,finance,20052
"Is A Company Abusing The Tax Code When It Does This, And How Does The IRS Prevent It? ","A rather good IRS paper on the topic states that a donation of a business' in-kind inventory would be  Under IRC 170(e)(1), however, the fair market value must be   reduced by the amount of gain that would not be long-term capital gain if the   property had been sold by the donor at the property's fair market value (determined   at the time of the contribution). Under this rule, deductions for donated inventory   are limited to the property's basis (generally its cost), where the fair market value   exceeds the basis.  There are references to IRC regulations in a narrative context you may find helpful: This paper goes on for 16 pages describing detailed exceptions and the political reasons for the exceptions (most of which are concerned with encouraging the donation of prepared food from restaurants/caterers to hunger charities by guaranteeing a value for something that would otherwise be trashed valueless); and a worked out example of fur coats that had a cost of goods of $200 and a market value of $1000.","!Only one message at a time.

Why do bank statements end on *SUCH* wildly inconsistent days of the month?,"They need to spread the work for all customers over the whole month, and they don't work on weekends. Combine the two, and the rule becomes clear - if months have minimum of N working days, 1/N of all customers gets set on each day. You seem to be on day 5: If the month starts with a Monday, the fifth working day is the 5. (Friday); if there is a Sat or Sun in between, it will be the 6th, and if there is both a Sat and a Sun in there, it will be the 7th. However, the statement itself is not very important at all. It is just the day where they print it on paper (or even only on a PDF). You can see your bank account activity every day 24/7 by checking online, and nothing keeps you from printing it on every 1st of the month if you want (or every day, or whenever you prefer).","Bank statements typically end on different days of the month for a few reasons. One reason is that banks often have different policies for generating and issuing statements. Some banks may issue statements on a set schedule, such as the last day of the month, while others may issue statements more frequently, such as every week or every other week.Another reason that bank statements may end on different days of the month is that they typically reflect a period of time rather than a specific day. For example, a bank statement might cover a period of one month, but the statement date may not necessarily be the last day of that month. Instead, the statement date may be a few days after the end of the statement period to allow for the bank to finalize and print the statement.Additionally, some banks may use different statement cycles for different types of accounts or for different customers. This can result in statements being issued on different days of the month for different accounts or for the same account at different times.Overall, the specific date that a bank statement ends on can depend on a variety of factors and may not be the same from one statement to the next.",,finance,20311
How are Canada Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) & related tax measures changing in 2015?,"The Child Care Expense Deduction (line 214) dollar limits will each increase by $1000, to new amounts of $8000 for children under 7 and $5000 for children age 7–16. Notes: As a tax deduction, your tax liability gets reduced at your marginal income tax rate, not the lowest tax rate (as would be the case for a tax credit). Yes, you still need receipts from your child care provider to support any claim. The non-refundable child tax credit a.k.a. amount for children under age 18 (line 367) introduced in 2007 is being eliminated starting in tax year 2015 coincident with the UCCB enhancement above. The credit could previously reduce tax liability by ~$340. The Family Tax Cut is being introduced and will be effective for tax year 2014. That is, when you file your 2014 income tax return in early 2015, you may be able to take advantage of this measure for income already earned in 2014. Provided a couple has at least one child under the age of 18, the Family Tax Cut will permit the transfer of up to $50,000 of taxable income from the higher income spouse's income tax return to the lower income spouse's return. While the potential transfer of $50,000 of taxable income to lower tax brackets sounds like a really big deal, the maximum tax relief is capped at $2000.","I'm sorry, but my knowledge cutoff is in 2021 and I don't have any information about changes to the Canada Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) or related tax measures after that date. It's possible that there have been changes to these programs since then, and I would recommend checking with a reliable source for the most up-to-date information.The Canada Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) is a program that provides financial assistance to families with children under the age of 6 to help with the cost of child care. The UCCB was introduced in 2006 and was designed to help families with young children afford the cost of child care so that parents could work, attend school, or pursue other activities.Eligibility for the UCCB is based on a number of factors, including the age of the child, the family's income, and the number of children in the family. The amount of the benefit is also determined by these factors, and is paid out on a monthly basis.In addition to the UCCB, there are also other tax measures in place that can help families with children save on their taxes, such as the Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB) and the Child Disability Benefit (CDB). These programs provide financial assistance to families with children, and are also based on a number of factors, including the family's income and the number of children in the family.Again, I would recommend checking with a reliable source for the most up-to-date information about the UCCB and related tax measures, as these programs may have changed since my knowledge cutoff.",,finance,19350
To whom should I report fraud on both of my credit cards?,You need to run a virus scan on your computers to make sure you do not have a key-logger program running on either.  I would also think about designating one old computer to only access your bank accounts and not do anything but that.   If your computer is infected then every time you login your credit cards can be compromised.,"If you suspect that your credit cards have been used fraudulently, it is important to report the fraud as soon as possible. Here are some steps you can take:Contact your credit card issuer: Call the number on the back of your credit card or log in to your account online to report the fraud. The issuer will cancel your card and issue you a new one.File a police report: If the fraud involves a large amount of money or if you have information about the person who committed the fraud, consider filing a police report. This can be helpful in the event that the perpetrator is caught and you need to provide evidence in court.Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports from all three credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) to see if there are any unauthorized charges or accounts. You can request a free copy of your credit report from each bureau once a year at annualcreditreport.com.Consider a credit freeze: If you are concerned about ongoing fraud, you may want to consider freezing your credit. A credit freeze will prevent anyone from opening new accounts in your name, but it will also prevent you from opening new accounts until you unfreeze your credit.Consider identity theft protection: If you are worried about ongoing fraud or identity theft, you may want to consider signing up for identity theft protection.

Split buying a house 3 ways. How do I approach this?,"I would second the advice to not do this. Real estate ownership is complex to begin with, involving a constant stream of maintenance, financing, and other decisions.  It is difficult enough to do for a single individual or a family as a unit (a couple), but at least spouses are forced to compromise. Friends are not, and you can end up with long-running conflicts and impasses. Financial transactions of any kind impose tensions on relationships, and friendships are no exception. If you want your friendship to survivie, do not sacrifice it to the financial arrangement which seems like a good idea at the moment. My advice would be to steer clear, no matter how attractive on the surface the deal might look. Focus on your own individual finances and use discipline and patience to save the amount needed for acquiring a separate investment property. But it will be 100% yours, and will save tons of headache. Since you are still considering this deal, it's a great time to politely change your mind and walk away - believe me, a few minutes of inconvenience will save you years of frustration. Good luck!","There are a few things to consider when it comes to splitting the purchase of a house with other people.

This could involve taking out a mortgage together or each person contributing a certain amount of cash towards the purchase.Consult with a lawyer: It is a good idea to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the co-ownership arrangement is legally sound and to protect your interests.Keep good records: It is important to keep accurate records of all financial transactions related to the property, including any payments or contributions made towards the purchase or maintenance of the property.Splitting the purchase of a house with other people can be a great way to afford a property that might otherwise be out of reach, but it is important to carefully consider all of the above factors and to have a clear understanding of the terms of the co-ownership arrangement.",,finance,20188

Pay bill now or later?,"Another, perhaps simpler approach to the same result as @BenMiller. Firstly, if you can pay off the debt today, for 1695.70 cash, then that is the amount of your debt to the hospital.  There is no such thing as a discount for cash; just extra money to pay if don't pay immediately.  This extra money is called interest, and the hospital is indeed charging you interest. Use any mortgage program to find the interest rate if you pay off a debt of 1695.70 with 60 monthly payments of 37.68.  The program should tell you that you are paying 12.64% effective annual interest. If you can earn more than that, after taxes, with your money somewhere else, then invest the cash there and pay off the hospital over time.  If you can't, then pay off the debt immediately, and avoid writing 60 cheques. EDIT:  Incorrect calculation revised as per @Ben Miller","It is generally a good idea to pay bills as soon as possible to avoid late fees and to maintain a good credit score. However, the decision to pay a bill now or later depends on your financial situation and the specific circumstances of the bill. Here are a few things to consider:Late fees: Many bills have late fees if they are not paid by the due date. These fees can add up quickly and make it more expensive to pay the bill later.Credit score: Paying bills on time is a key factor in maintaining a good credit score. Late payments can negatively impact your credit score, which can make it more difficult to get approved for loans or credit cards in the future.Available funds: If you do not have the funds to pay the bill now, it may be necessary to pay it later when you have more money available. However, be sure to consider the potential consequences of not paying the bill on time, such as late fees or negative impact on your credit score.Ultimately, the best course of action will depend on your specific circumstances. It may be helpful to create a budget to help manage your bills and financial responsibilities.",,finance,20723
Why would a company like Apple be buying back its own shares?,"I think JB King's answer is interesting from the point of view of ""is this good for me"" but the OP's question boils down to ""why would a company do this?"" The company buys back shares when it thinks it will better position the company financially. A Simple Scenario: If Company A wants to open a new store, for example, they need to buy the land, build the store, stock it, etc, etc and this all costs money.  The company can get a loan, use accrued capital, or raise new capital by issuing new stock.  Each method has benefits and drawbacks. One of the drawbacks of issuing new stock is that it dilutes the existing stock's value.  Previously, total company profits were split between x shares.  Now the profits are shared between x+y shares, where y is the number of new shares issued to raise the capital. This normally drives the price of the stock down, since the expected future dividends per stock have decreased. Now the company has a problem: the next time they go to raise money by issuing stock, they will have to issue MORE shares to get the same value - leading to more dilution.  To break out of this cycle, the company can buy back shares periodically.  When the company feels the the stock is sufficiently undervalued, it buys some back.  Now the profits are shared with a smaller pool, and the stock price goes up, and the next time Company A needs to raise capital, it can issue stock. So it probably has little to do with rewarding shareholders, and more to do with lowering the ""cost of capital"" for the company in the future.","There are a few reasons why a company like Apple might buy back its own shares:To increase the value of the remaining shares: When a company buys back its own shares, it reduces the total number of outstanding shares on the market. This can lead to an increase in the value of the remaining shares, as each share represents a larger portion of the company's ownership.To return value to shareholders: Some companies use share buybacks as a way to return value to shareholders, especially when they have excess cash on hand and do not have any immediate plans for it. Share buybacks can be a way for companies to distribute profits to shareholders without actually paying dividends.To improve financial ratios: Buying back shares can also improve a company's financial ratios, such as its price-to-earnings ratio and its earnings per share. This can make the company more attractive to investors and potentially increase the value of its stock.To reduce the risk of a hostile takeover: By buying back its own shares, a company can make it more difficult for another company or individual to gain a controlling stake in the company. This can help the company maintain its independence and protect itself from a hostile takeover.",,finance,21200
Are the guaranteed returns of regulated utilities really what they sound like?,"No. That return on equity number is a target that the regulators consider when approving price hikes. If PG&E tried to get a 20% RoE, the regulator would deny the request. Utilities are basically compelled to accept price regulation in return for a  monopoly on utility business in a geographic area. There are obviously no guarantees that a utility will make money, but these good utilities are good stable investments that generally speaking will not make you rich, but appreciate nicely over time. Due to deregulation, however, they are a more complex investment than they once were. Basically, the utility builds and maintains a bunch of physical infrastructure, buys fuel and turns it into electricity. So they have fixed costs, regulated pricing, market-driven costs for fuel, and market-driven demand for electricity.  Also consider that the marginal cost of adding capacity to the electric grid is incredibly high, so uneven demand growth or economic disruption in the utility service area can hurt the firms return on equity (and thus the stock price). Compare the stock performance of HE (the Hawaiian electric utlity) to ED (Consolidated Edison, the NYC utility) to SO (Southern Companies, the utility for much of the South). You can see that the severe impact of the recession on HE really damaged the stock -- location matters. Buying strategy is key as well -- during bad market conditions, money flows into these stocks (which are considered to be low-risk ""defensive"" investments) and inflates the price. You don't want to buy utilities at a peak... you need to dollar-cost average a position over a period of years and hold it. Focus on the high quality utilities or quality local utilities if you understand your local market. Look at Southern Co, Progress Energy, Duke Energy or American Electric Power as high-quality benchmarks to compare with other utilities.","Regulated utilities are companies that provide essential services such as electricity, gas, and water to the public. These companies are typically regulated by government agencies, which set the rates that the utilities can charge for their services. The rates are usually set at a level that allows the utilities to recover their costs, including the cost of financing their operations, and to earn a reasonable return on their investment.The guaranteed returns that regulated utilities may receive are often referred to as ""allowed returns"" or ""authorized returns."" These returns are intended to compensate the utilities for the risks they take in providing essential services to the public and to ensure that they have the financial resources they need to maintain and improve their infrastructure.The allowed returns for regulated utilities may be based on a number of factors, including the cost of capital, the level of risk involved in providing the service, and the level of competition in the market. In some cases, the allowed returns may be set through a process known as rate-making, in which the regulatory agency considers the utilities' costs and revenue requirements and sets the rates accordingly.It's important to note that the allowed returns for regulated utilities are not guaranteed, as they may be adjusted based on changes in the economic conditions or the utilities' performance. However, the regulatory process is designed to provide a degree of stability and predictability for the utilities, which can help them plan and invest in the long term.",,finance,20315

The holder of an option can exercise their right to buy or sell the underlying asset at any time before the option expires, as long as the option is still in the money. The expiration date is the last day on which the option can be exercised. If the option is not exercised by the expiration date, it will expire worthless.Options are typically used as a way to hedge risk or to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset. The holder of a call option has the right to buy the underlying asset, while the holder of a put option has the right to sell the underlying asset. The underlying asset can be a variety of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, or futures contracts.",,finance,22270
How to Calculate Profit and Loss for trading position?,"Month to date For the month to date (MTD), the price on Feb 28th is $4.58 and the price on March 16th is $4.61 so the return is which can be written more simply as The position is 1000 shares valued at $4580 on Feb 28th, so the profit on the month to date is Calendar year to date For the calendar year to date (YTD), the price on Dec 31st is $4.60 and the price on Feb 28th is $4.58 so the return to Feb 28th is The return from Feb 28th to March 16th is 0.655022 % so the year to date return is or more directly So the 2011 YTD profit on 1000 shares valued at $4600 on Dec 31st is Year to date starting Dec 10th For the year to date starting Dec 10th, the starting value is and the value on Dec 31st is 1000 * $4.60 = $4600 so the return is $4600 / $4510 - 1 = 0.0199557 = 1.99557 % The year to date profit is therefore Note - YTD is often understood to mean calendar year to date.  To cover all the bases state both, ie ""calendar YTD (2011)"" and ""YTD starting Dec 10th 2010"". Edit further to comment For the calendar year to date, with 200 shares sold on Jan 10th with the share price at $4.58, the return from Dec 31st to Jan 10th is The return from Jan 10th to Feb 28th is The return from Feb 28th to March 16th is The profit on 1000 shares from Dec 31st to Jan 10th is $4600 * -0.00434783 = -$20 The profit on 800 shares from Jan 10th to Feb 28th is zero. The profit on 800 shares from Feb 28th to March 16th is So the year to date profit is $4.","To calculate the profit or loss for a trading position, you will need to know the following information:The entry price: This is the price at which you opened the trade (bought or sold) the security.The exit price: This is the price at which you closed the trade (bought or sold) the security.The size of the trade: This is the number of units of the security that you bought or sold.To calculate the profit or loss, you will need to subtract the entry price from the exit price, and then multiply the result by the size of the trade. If the result is positive, you have made a profit; if it is negative, you have made a loss.For example, let's say you bought 100 shares of a stock at a price of $50 per share, and then sold them at a price of $60 per share. The profit on the trade would be ($60 - $50) * 100 = $1000.On the other hand, if you had sold the shares at a price of $40 per share, the loss on the trade would be ($40 - $50) * 100 = -$1000.It's important to note that these calculations do not take into account any commissions or fees that you may have paid to execute the trade. You will need to subtract these costs from your profit or add them to your loss to get the true profit or loss on the trade.",,finance,19257

It's important to keep the area clean and allow it to heal properly. Applying Neosporin can help to prevent infection and promote healing. It's also a good idea for your fiance to avoid sexual activity until the area has fully healed. This will give the frenulum time to properly heal and reduce the risk of further injury or complications.

Once the frenulum has fully healed, it's likely that your fiance's sexual function will return to normal. However, it's important to note that every person is different and healing times can vary. If your fiance experiences any persistent pain or difficulty with sexual activity after the frenulum has healed, it's important for him to speak with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.

It's also worth noting that tearing the frenulum should not have any effect on your fiance's reproductive status.

"Suggest treatment for rashes on neckI had a questionable encounter with an individual about a year ago. I took a rapid test at a local clinic about 1 month ago, I have since developed a rash on my neck. As such, my question is 2 fold. How accurate are the rapid antibody tests, and can they be read incorrectly?","Hello,I read carefully your query and understand your concern. The Rapid test detects HIV antibodies in the blood. Most people will develop enough HIV antibodies to be detected three to four weeks after infection. The Rapid test is just as accurate as a Standard HIV test.If you test negative, then you do not require any further tests.Hope my answer was helpful.If you have further queries feel free to contact me again.Kind regards! Dr.Dorina Gurabardhi General &Family Physician","It is difficult to accurately diagnose and suggest treatment for a rash without physically examining the rash and obtaining a medical history. I recommend that you see a healthcare provider for an evaluation of the rash. They will be able to determine the cause of the rash and recommend the appropriate treatment.

As for the accuracy of rapid antibody tests, it is important to note that these tests can produce false negative results, particularly in the early stages of infection. This means that it is possible for the test to produce a negative result even if you are infected. False negative results are more common with rapid tests compared to laboratory-based tests. It is also possible for rapid tests to produce false positive results, although this is less common.

It is important to note that a positive result on a rapid antibody test does not necessarily mean that you are currently infected. Antibodies may persist in the body for some time after infection, so a positive result could indicate a past infection. A healthcare provider will be able to provide more information about the accuracy and limitations of the rapid test and interpret the results in the context of your medical history.",,medicine,24165

"How to treat the pain caused in the sternum for a person having bilateral mastectomy?I was diagnosed with Stage 2A breast cancer in February 2011.  I have had a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy and now have saline breast implants.  For the past few days, I have been experiencing pain between the 5th and 6th ribs to the left of my sternum.  The pain is worse when I breathe.  Is this costochondritis?  A problem with the implants?  Metastasis?  Please give me your thoughts.  Thank you.","Hi,Thanks for writing in.The pain in costochondritis is typically in the front of chest next to the sternum and might cause lot of distress. It is a sharp pain.Breast implants can cause irritation of the nerves in the anterior chest wall causing pain perception. This pain is more localized to the area where implants are present and usually does not radiate to other places.Metastasis is pain due to bone destruction. This is diffuse pain which increases on palpation and focused on the area overlying the bone.It is suggested that you get a chest X ray or CT scan done to evaluate in detail the cause and nature of problem leading to the pain.","I'm sorry to hear about your breast cancer diagnosis and the pain you are experiencing. It is possible that the pain you are experiencing could be caused by costochondritis, which is inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the sternum. This condition can be caused by physical strain, respiratory infections, or underlying medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia.

It is also possible that the pain could be related to your breast implants. If the implants are causing discomfort or pain, it is important to speak with your doctor about your symptoms. It is also important to rule out the possibility of metastasis, or the spread of cancer to other parts of the body. If you are experiencing other symptoms in addition to the pain in your sternum, or if the pain is severe or persists for an extended period of time, it is important to speak with your doctor as soon as possible.

In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help alleviate the pain:

Rest: Try to avoid activities that cause or exacerbate the pain, and take breaks to rest as needed.

Apply heat or cold: Applying heat or cold to the affected area can help reduce inflammation and pain. You can use a heating pad, hot water bottle, or warm compress, or try taking a warm bath or shower. Alternatively, you can try applying an ice pack wrapped in a towel to the affected area for short periods of time.

Take over-the-counter pain medication: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) can help reduce inflammation and pain. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label and speak with your doctor before taking any medication.

Practice good posture: Maintaining good posture can help reduce strain on the chest muscles and ribs. Try to keep your shoulders relaxed and avoid slouching or hunching over.

Stretch: Gentle stretches can help to reduce muscle tension and improve flexibility. You can try stretching your chest muscles by standing with your arms at your sides and your palms facing forward. Slowly lift your arms up and back as far as is comfortable, keeping your elbows straight. Hold the stretch for a few seconds and then release.

"Q. What do right bundle branch block and mild mitral regurgitation mean?Hello doctor,My 18-year-old son got an ECG and blood tests last month as a requirement for medical screening. He jogs every night for 30 minutes. He looks healthy. We consulted our cardiologist early this month and he requested for 2D Echo and treadmill stress test. Unfortunately, we were scheduled for a consult but now we have lockdown for Covid-19. I hope you can help me understand the condition of my son. Thank you.",Hi. Could you upload his ECG (electrocardiogram) if it has been taken and also his echo and treadmill results?,"Right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a type of heart block that occurs when there is a delay or obstruction in the electrical signals that coordinate the contraction of the right side of the heart. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including scarring of the heart tissue, inflammation, or abnormalities in the heart's structure.

Mild mitral regurgitation (MR) refers to a condition in which the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart, does not close properly. As a result, some of the blood that has been pumped from the left ventricle leaks back into the left atrium, instead of being pumped out to the rest of the body. Mild MR is generally considered to be a mild form of the condition, in which the leakage of blood is minimal.

It is important to note that the presence of RBBB and mild MR does not necessarily mean that your son has a serious heart condition. However, it is important to follow up with your cardiologist and undergo any recommended tests or procedures to determine the cause and appropriate treatment, if necessary. It is also important for your son to continue to follow a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a healthy diet, and avoiding tobacco and excess alcohol, to support the health of his heart.",,medicine,23229

"How can front teeth positions be corrected?hello, I am an 18 yr old male. I got my braces off 2 years back. I wore my retainers for about 10 months and then i discontinued wearing them. Now i feel that my front teeth are shifting forward from the root! What is the best way to correct them. I dont want braces again. Thanks","Hello Read your query as you have undergone orthodontic treatment now you feel of forwadly shifting of tooth dont worry you have to wear retainer for year as it was advisved by your orthodontist , I will suggest you to consult your orthodontist again and go for oral examination and discuss about retainer . Hope this will help you.","It's natural for teeth to shift over time, especially if you are no longer wearing retainers. If your front teeth have shifted significantly and you are unhappy with the way they look, there are a few options that you could consider to correct their position:

Orthodontic treatment: This may involve wearing braces or aligners to gently guide your teeth back into position. This is usually the most effective way to correct misaligned teeth, but it can be time-consuming and may not be the most convenient option for you.

Bonding: If your teeth have only shifted slightly, you may be able to correct their position using dental bonding. This involves applying a composite resin material to your teeth and sculpting it into the desired shape. Bonding can be completed in a single office visit, but it may not be as durable as other treatment options.

Veneers: If you want to make more significant changes to the appearance of your front teeth, you may want to consider veneers. Veneers are thin shells that are applied to the front of your teeth and can be used to correct misalignment, as well as other cosmetic issues. Veneers are more expensive than bonding and require more than one office visit to complete.

It's important to consult with a dentist or orthodontist to determine the best course of treatment for your specific needs. They can help you weigh the pros and cons of each option and choose the one that will be most effective and appropriate for you.",,medicine,23717

Is it to be concerned about the lump in the chest of child?Hi My baby has a small lump on his chest. when he was born i noticed a tiny hole and when we talked to the GP he said its nothing to worry about but now there is a lump in place of the hole and soft when pressed and kinda like jelly. he is not in any pain but am concerned what does this mean,"Hi, welcome to HCM. I see similar cases in my clinic everyday. During prenatal period sometimes maternal hormones like estrogen pass in baby which causes swelling of breasts on 3 or 4 th day, a white creamy liquid may also ooze from the nipples. Usually, no treatment is required. Engorged breast should not be pressed, massaged or squeezed since this may result in infection. I hope this has helped you. Take care. Regards - Dr Deepak Patel, MD Pediatrics","It is understandable that you are concerned about your child's lump on their chest. It is important to have any new or unusual lumps or bumps checked by a medical professional. While it is possible that the lump is benign (non-cancerous) and not a cause for concern, it is important to have it evaluated to determine the cause and appropriate treatment, if necessary.

There are many different potential causes for a lump on the chest, including a cyst, an abscess, an inflamed lymph node, or a lipoma (a benign fatty tumor). The only way to determine the cause of the lump is to have it examined by a doctor.

I recommend that you schedule an appointment with your child's pediatrician or a dermatologist to have the lump evaluated. The doctor will likely ask about your child's medical history and perform a physical examination of the lump. They may also recommend additional tests, such as a biopsy or imaging studies, to help determine the cause of the lump.

In the meantime, it is important to continue to monitor the lump and see if it changes in size or becomes painful. If you notice any changes or if your child experiences any other concerning symptoms, such as fever or difficulty breathing, it is important to contact your child's doctor right away.",,medicine,24164
"Suggest treatment for rashes in handHi I went to the doctor yesterday to show him a rash on the back of my hands, but he didn't see the white lines and circles that show up and then go away. The redness also goes away then comes back and my feet and palms itch. The circles and lines look really scary, like crop circles or something","Hi. Welcome to HCMfrom what you described you seem to be having allergic reactions causing wheals or hives. Is this the first episode or do you have a previous history of allergies in the past. Try and recall any possible cause of the rash. Any history of outdoor activity, exposure to plants, dust, animals, chemicals, any medication , any particular food. Anything you have been allergic to in the past?Once you can narrow down the possible factor, you will have to avoid it or you will keep having similar reactions. Seeing circles and lines, either white or reddish wherever you apply pressure, or scratch, is called dermographism and is a sign of sensitivity and high allergy levels in blood. So do consult a doctor regarding tests for the blood levels of eosinophils, serum IgE etc, which can show allergy. Skin tests can also be done to check specific reactions.Very rarely this reaction can happen even in normal skin.Apply a menthol/calamine lotion for the itching, 2-3 times a day. Start an antihistamine daily for 5-7 days after consulting the dermatologist. They may advise a longer course after seeing your blood work. This can help bring the allergy levels in control.If it is severe or persistent, you may be advised a cortisone shot in the ER.Use a mild soap for washing, avoid harsh chemicals. In case you have severe swelling, puffiness of face, lips, difficulty breathing, etc go to the ER immediately.Hope this helps guide you. Try to see the doctor as soon as the rashes appear.","It's difficult to give a specific treatment recommendation without being able to see the rash and knowing more about your overall health and medical history. It's important to follow up with your doctor or a dermatologist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, you can try the following measures to help alleviate the symptoms of your rash:

Keep the affected areas clean and dry.
Avoid scratching the rash, as this can further irritate the skin and potentially cause infection.
Apply a moisturizer to the affected areas to help soothe the skin and reduce dryness.
Take over-the-counter antihistamines, such as loratadine (Claritin) or cetirizine (Zyrtec), to help reduce itching.
Avoid contact with irritants that may be causing or worsening the rash, such as certain soaps, detergents, or chemicals.
If the rash is severe or if you have other symptoms such as fever, difficulty breathing, or swelling, it's important to seek medical attention immediately.",,medicine,23806

I can understand your concern. Terminal stage cancer pain is one of the most cumbersome pain. Routine painkiller drugs will not help much. Patient needs centrally acting painkiller drugs.

Cancer-related pain can be difficult to manage and can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life.

One option for managing cancer-related pain is the use of a pain patch. Pain patches are medications that are applied to the skin and are absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream. They can be an effective way to manage chronic pain, including cancer-related pain.

There are several different types of pain patches available, including those that contain medications such as fentanyl, buprenorphine, and oxycodone. These patches are generally prescribed by a doctor and are available through a pharmacy.

It is important to follow the instructions provided by the doctor or pharmacist when using a pain patch. This includes applying the patch to clean, dry skin, changing the patch according to the prescribed schedule, and disposing of used patches properly to avoid accidental exposure to others.

If your father is experiencing severe cancer-related pain and pain patches are not providing adequate relief, it is important to speak with his healthcare team. They may be able to suggest other treatment options or adjust the current treatment plan to better manage his pain.",,medicine,23618

They can appear anywhere on the body, but are commonly found on the face, particularly the chin and around the lips.

There are several steps you can take to help clear or lessen the appearance of whiteheads:

Keep your skin clean: Wash your face twice a day with a mild, oil-free cleanser to remove excess oil and dirt. Avoid scrubbing your skin, as this can irritate it and make the problem worse.

Use salicylic acid: This is a type of beta hydroxy acid that helps to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores. Look for products that contain salicylic acid, such as face washes or toners, and use them as directed.

Use a non-comedogenic moisturizer: Choose a moisturizer that is specifically designed for acne-prone skin and won't clog pores. Look for products that are labeled ""non-comedogenic"" or ""oil-free.""

Avoid touching your face: Hands can transfer bacteria and oil to the skin, so it's important to avoid touching your face as much as possible.

Avoid picking or squeezing whiteheads: This can cause inflammation and may lead to scarring. If you do need to extract a whitehead, make sure to do it gently and with clean hands and tools.

Use a gentle exfoliant: Gently exfoliating your skin can help to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Look for products that contain alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs).

Use a spot treatment: If you have a single whitehead that you need to treat, you can use a spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These products can help to kill bacteria and dry out the whitehead.

It's important to remember that it can take time and patience to clear up whiteheads. If you have tried these steps and your whiteheads are still not improving, it may be a good idea to see a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.",,medicine,24312

At 18 years age, you are too young to judge the size of  your penis. It is made up of muscles and the growth at puberty and adolescent is under the influence of testosterone. A research study was done in healthy Indian males on penis size during flaccid and erect and the width of the penis. Mean flaccid length was found to be 8.21 cm, mean stretched length 10.88 cm and circumference 9.14 cm. Mean erected length was found to be 13.01 cm and erected circumference was 11.46 cm. If your penis measurements are at least as mentioned above then there is no need to worry.Semen flowing with urine is a misconception in most men at your age. If you feel it is present then it needs to be evaluated after clinical examination with the urologist. Any urine infection must also be ruled out.","!

It is characterized by obsessions, which are unwanted and intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that cause anxiety or distress, and compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession.

Treatment for OCD often involves a combination of medications and therapy. Fluoxetine, which is a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is often used to treat OCD. SSRIs work by increasing the levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain that is involved in mood and behavior.

While there is no known ""cure"" for OCD, treatment can be very effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. It is important to work with a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, to determine the best treatment plan for you. Therapy options for OCD include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP), which have been shown to be effective in treating OCD.

It is not uncommon for people with OCD to need long-term treatment to manage their symptoms. However, it is possible for some people to eventually taper off or stop taking medication or to reduce the frequency of therapy sessions. It is important to work closely with your treatment team and follow their recommendations for care.",,medicine,23668

What causes vomiting after brushing teeth?Yesterday morning while brushing i vomited and after that saw a very small amount of brown color in my saliva. and after that i am seeing small amount of brown color in my saliva. Most of the time the saliva is not in pure white color.please suggest me what to do?,"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns..As per your complain vomiting and nausea during brushing teeth is commonly seen in individuals as many individuals have a sensitive soft palate and when brush touches the palate deep or there is accumulation of foam and saliva in mouth there is a gag reflex and some people may tend to vomit..The brownish colour that you have seen seems to be traces of blood that might have occurred due to bleeding from the area of throat due to vigorous gagging or can be due to bleeding from throat or oropharyngeal region if you have any conditions like acid reflux, chronic upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, throat inflammation etc..In case if you experience frank blood or repeated episodes of brown colour in saliva you should consult an Oral Physician or an Otolaryngologist and get evaluated and treatment of underlying cause will relieve the symptoms..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards.Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.","There are several possible causes for vomiting after brushing teeth, including:

Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of some types of dental anesthetics, such as nitrous oxide (also known as laughing gas). This could be the cause if you were given an anesthetic during your dental procedure.

Vomiting can also be a sign of a gag reflex, which is a normal reflex that occurs when the back of the throat is stimulated. This could be the case if you have a strong gag reflex or if the dental instruments used during your procedure triggered your gag reflex.

Vomiting could also be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as an infection, food poisoning, or a gastrointestinal issue.

If you are seeing a small amount of brown color in your saliva and the saliva is not pure white, this could be due to a number of factors, including the presence of blood or food particles in the saliva, or the presence of certain medications or substances in the body.

If you are concerned about your symptoms or if you continue to experience vomiting or changes in the color of your saliva, it is important to speak with a medical or dental professional for further evaluation and guidance.

These symptoms could be indicative of normal pressure hydrocephalus. In such case, the lumbar puncture would help as a diagnostic tool for this disorder. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Best regards!","A lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap, is a medical procedure in which a needle is inserted into the lower back to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for laboratory testing.

To diagnose certain neurological conditions, such as meningitis or multiple sclerosis
To evaluate the pressure of the CSF
To determine the cause of certain symptoms, such as headache or confusion
To administer certain medications, such as chemotherapy agents or anesthetics
To relieve pressure on the brain, as in the case of a subarachnoid hemorrhage

I can understand your concern. TMT (trade mill test) can be positive with normal blood pressure, lipid level and sugar levels. Positive TMT is suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD) Stress and anxiety are independent risk factors for heart diseases like CAD. And risk of CAD is high in post menopausal woman (54 years). So your client should be evaluated for CAD. So ask her to consult cardiologist and get done Coronary angiography to rule out CAD. If there is obstruction then she will need stenting or bypass procedure depending on the angiography report. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your client. Thanks.","It is important for the patient to see a healthcare provider to determine the cause of the shortness of breath, anxiety, and headache and determine the appropriate treatment. The healthcare provider will likely conduct a physical examination and review the patient's medical history and any test results, including the TMT (stress test) results.

If the TMT is positive but the patient has no complaints of high blood pressure, diabetes, or other conditions, the healthcare provider may recommend further testing to determine the cause of the positive TMT result. This could include imaging tests such as an echocardiogram or cardiac MRI, or other tests to assess the function of the heart and blood vessels.

Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the symptoms. If the TMT is positive and the patient has underlying heart disease or other cardiovascular issues, the healthcare provider may recommend medications or lifestyle changes to manage these conditions. If the patient has anxiety, the healthcare provider may recommend therapy or medication to manage the anxiety. If the patient has a headache, the healthcare provider may recommend over-the-counter or prescription pain medication, or suggest strategies for managing stress or other possible causes of the headache.

It is important for the patient to follow the treatment recommendations of their healthcare provider and to seek medical attention if their symptoms worsen or if they have any other concerns.",,medicine,23586

So get done CBC to rule out anemia and S. TSH to rule out thyroid diseases.If these are also normal than your symptoms may be due to stress and anxiety.  So better to avoid stress and tension.

It is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing these symptoms, as they can be a sign of a serious health condition. Some possible causes of chest pain and dizziness include:

Heart problems: Chest pain and dizziness can be symptoms of heart problems such as angina, a heart attack, or a cardiac arrhythmia.

I am only on day five but, have read many worrying effects about this pill such as blood clots, excessive weight gain, and cancer risk. I was wondering if these health claims are all true and whether it is worth taking the pill for acne or if I should be asking my GP for something else.
It's understandable to have concerns about taking any medication, especially if you've read about potential side effects. However, it's important to keep in mind that birth control pills, including Dianette, can be a safe and effective treatment option for acne when used as directed.

Like any medication, birth control pills can have potential side effects, and it's important to discuss these with your healthcare provider before starting treatment. While some people may experience side effects such as weight gain or blood clots while taking birth control pills, it's important to note that these are relatively rare.

It's also worth noting that while some studies have suggested a potential link between taking certain types of birth control pills and an increased risk of certain types of cancer, the overall risk of developing cancer is small.

Ultimately, the decision to take a birth control pill for acne or any other condition should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider, who can consider your individual circumstances and medical history and help you weigh the potential risks and benefits. If you have concerns about taking the pill, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider about your options. They may be able to suggest alternative treatment options or help you manage any side effects that you may experience.",,medicine,23782

"Q. How to correct bedwetting of a 9 year old?Hi doctor,My child, who is 9 years old, has bedwetting problem. Please suggest me.",Hi. For further information consult an internal medicine physician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician,"Q. How to correct bedwetting of a 9 year old?Hi doctor,My child, who is 9 years old, has bedwetting problem. Please suggest me.
Bedwetting, also known as enuresis, is a common problem among children, and it is usually not a cause for concern. Most children outgrow bedwetting on their own, and treatment is usually not necessary. However, if your child's bedwetting is causing distress or problems, there are several things you can try to help your child stop wetting the bed:

Encourage your child to go to the bathroom before bedtime and make sure they empty their bladder completely.

Consider using an alarm system to wake your child up when they start to wet the bed. These alarms can be purchased online or at a medical supply store.

Try to reduce your child's fluid intake in the evening, particularly caffeine-containing drinks like soda and chocolate.

Consider using a bedwetting product, such as a moisture-absorbing mattress pad or a bedwetting alarm that attaches to your child's clothing.

Talk to your child's doctor about whether medication might be helpful in managing the bedwetting.

It's important to be patient and understanding with your child as they learn to control their bladder. Bedwetting can be a frustrating and embarrassing problem, but with your support and encouragement, your child can overcome it.",,medicine,23164

Fungal infections of the skin, including those on the penis, can be uncomfortable and embarrassing, but they are generally not serious and can be treated effectively with antifungal medications.

It is important to see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment of a fungal infection on the penis. Over-the-counter antifungal creams or ointments may provide temporary relief, but they are not usually sufficient to completely clear the infection.

Your healthcare provider can prescribe a stronger antifungal medication, such as terbinafine or itraconazole, which may be taken by mouth or applied topically. It is important to follow the instructions for use provided by your healthcare provider and to complete the full course of treatment, even if the symptoms go away before the medication is finished.

It is also important to practice good hygiene to help prevent the spread of fungal infections and to reduce the risk of re-infection. This includes washing the affected area daily with soap and water and drying thoroughly, avoiding sharing towels or underwear, and wearing loose-fitting, breathable clothing.

In my opinion you are positive for tuberculosis, please visit nearby doctor and start the AKT (Anti koch's treatment) or ATT (Antituberculosis treatment).Glad to answer your further concern contact me on bit.ly/DrArunWe wish you a best health at healthcare magic. Thank you,Dr. Arun Tank","AFB stands for acid-fast bacilli, which are a type of bacterium that includes Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). The AFB test is a laboratory test that is used to detect the presence of AFB in a sample of bodily fluids or tissue. A positive result means that AFB were detected in the sample, while a negative result means that no AFB were detected.

PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction, which is a laboratory technique that is used to amplify small amounts of DNA. It can be used to detect the presence of M. tuberculosis in a sample, even when other methods, such as the AFB test, are negative. A positive PCR result for M. tuberculosis means that the bacterium was detected in the sample.

If you have been diagnosed with AFB negative but PCR for M.tuberculosis positive, it means that the AFB test did not detect the presence of AFB in your sample, but the PCR test did detect the presence of M. tuberculosis DNA. This suggests that you may have a TB infection. It is important to follow the treatment recommendations of your healthcare provider in order to properly treat the infection and prevent it from spreading to others.

It is also important to note that TB can be a serious illness, and it is important to receive proper treatment in order to fully recover. If you have any concerns about your diagnosis or treatment, it is always a good idea to discuss them with your healthcare provider.

Over-the-counter pain relievers: You can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) to help manage the pain.

Nasal decongestants: These can help to reduce swelling in the nasal passages and make it easier to breathe. They are available as a nasal spray or in pill form.

Nasal irrigation: Using a saline solution to rinse out your nasal passages can help to clear out mucus and reduce congestion. You can use a neti pot or a nasal irrigation bottle to do this.

Steam inhalation: Inhaling steam can help to open up the nasal passages and provide relief from sinus congestion. You can do this by filling a bowl with hot water and leaning over it with a towel over your head, or by using a humidifier.

Avoid irritants: Try to avoid things that can irritate your sinuses, such as tobacco smoke and strong odors.

It's difficult to say how long your symptoms will last, as it can vary from person to person. In most cases, sinus and ear pain will resolve on their own within a week or two. If your symptoms persist for longer than that, or if you have a fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing, you should contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.",,medicine,23914

What are the treatment options for having stone in interpolar right kidney?I have 4.9mm stone in interpolar right kidney. no hydronephrosisWhat are my treatment options? I had a stone episode 14 months ago and a 6mm stone was removed using ureteroscopy and stent last year from left kidney distal ureter.  The stone is a calcium oxalate stone.,"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.As long the stone is in the kidney there is no problem as it is a small stone. It is possible that the stone might enter the ureter (tube connecting kidney and urinary bladder) and when in the lower part of ureter and at that time it might cause obstruction to flow of urine. You might have pain at this time which will disappear once the stone reaches the urinary bladder. When this happens you might experience severe sharp pain for few days and require pain killers for sometime. Please continue drinking lots of water at that time.Stenting and ureteroscopy is not required unless the stone grows in size and causes obstruction to flow of urine.","There are several treatment options for a kidney stone in the interpolar region of the right kidney. The best option for you will depend on the size and location of the stone, as well as your overall health and medical history. Some common treatment options include:

Medications: Your doctor may prescribe medications to help you pass the kidney stone more easily. These may include medications to help relax the muscles in your ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder), or medications to help break down the stone.

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL): This is a non-invasive procedure that uses shock waves to break the kidney stone into smaller pieces, which can then pass more easily through the urinary tract.

Ureteroscopy: This is a procedure in which a small, flexible tube with a light and camera on the end is inserted through the urethra and up into the urinary tract. The doctor can then use instruments to remove the kidney stone or break it up into smaller pieces.

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): This is a surgical procedure in which a small incision is made in the back, and a tube is inserted through the incision and into the kidney to remove the stone.

Open surgery: In some cases, open surgery may be necessary to remove a large or complex kidney stone. This involves making a larger incision in the abdomen to access the stone and remove it.

Your doctor will discuss the best treatment options for you based on the size and location of your kidney stone, as well as your overall health and medical history. It's important to follow your doctor's recommendations and take any prescribed medications as directed to help manage your kidney stone and prevent future stones from forming.",,medicine,23712
"Is pregnancy,related with frequent urination,nausea and enlarged breast?My husband had a vasectomy 4 years ago for the past 2 weeks I have had pregnancy symptoms including urinating a lot, tender and enlarged breasts, feeling nauseous and now my period is 2 days late. I took a test last week it was negative.  I have a slight white discharge. Could I be pregnant?","Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and the symptoms of irregular hormones (which can also delay your period) are very similar to the symptoms of pregnancy.  Women sometimes don't ovulate at the same time as usual, and other factors, such as weight changes, travel, and stress, can also make your cycle abnormal.Furthermore, in your particular case, your husband has been sterilized.  And you had a pregnancy test that was negative, which is just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office.So I think you do not have to worry about being pregnant.To be totally secure about your husband's sterility, he could get a sperm count done to make sure the vasectomy worked, if you would find that reassuring.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown","Yes, frequent urination, nausea, and enlarged breasts can be symptoms of pregnancy. However, these symptoms can also be caused by other factors, such as stress, illness, or changes in medications. It is also possible to have these symptoms and not be pregnant.

If you have concerns about the possibility of being pregnant, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation. A healthcare provider can perform a physical examination and possibly order additional tests, such as a pregnancy test or an ultrasound, to determine the cause of your symptoms.

It is also important to note that, despite having a vasectomy, there is still a small chance that your husband could father a child. Vasectomies are generally very effective at preventing pregnancy, but they are not 100% effective. It is possible, although rare, for sperm to remain present in the vas deferens after a vasectomy and for pregnancy to occur.

If you are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and advice.",,medicine,23133
"Q. My 4 month baby has not passed stools. Please help.Hi doctor,My baby is 4 months old and is vomiting in between while having breast milk. His belly is not much hard, but there is more swelling when compared to the breastfeeding days. He has been switched to formula feed from Sunday night and till now he has not passed stools. I am worried about this. Please suggest anything natural. Thank you.","Hi. It is common to have a decrease in stool frequency or constipation after switching from breast milk to formula feed. As long as your child is feeding well, passing gas from below, has no vomiting and has a soft belly, there is nothing to worry about. It is normal to pass stool once every 2-3 days. Also, you may noticea change in stool color (green) after switching to formula feed. In this scenario, you can try using a cotton Q-tip (cotton swab). Apply some lubrication on it and stimulate the rectal area to see if your child passes stool. If this does not help, then try seeing your local pediatrician who can help with rectal stimulation and passage of his stool.","I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not able to diagnose medical conditions or provide treatment recommendations. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about your baby's health.

Babies can sometimes have difficulty with bowel movements, especially if they are constipated. Constipation in infants can be caused by a variety of factors, including a change in diet, dehydration, or a lack of physical activity. It is important to make sure your baby is getting enough fluids and is receiving adequate nutrition.

If you are concerned about your baby's bowel movements or vomiting, I recommend contacting your healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance. They will be able to assess your baby's symptoms and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, you can try gently massaging your baby's abdomen to help stimulate bowel movements, and make sure they are getting enough fluids.

I hope this information is helpful. Please remember to seek medical advice from a qualified healthcare professional if you have any concerns about your baby's health.",,medicine,23310

Is there any research to link motor tics to flu vaccine?My 10 year old son has been diagnosed with a motor tic disorder and PANDAS. This started last year in December. He has severe motor tics. Is there any reasearch to link this to flu vaccine? I have just realized that his symptoms were preceeded by a flu shot last year. His symptoms worsened this year after getting a flu shot.,HI motor tics and pandas as told by you are neuro psychiatric manifestations due to the antigens due to some disease which start attacking/liasing with our own nerves resulting in this symptoms.There is a probability of your kid getting accentuation of tics with the flu shot he received.,"There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the flu vaccine causes motor tics or PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections). The flu vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect against influenza, a potentially serious respiratory illness that can lead to hospitalization and even death.

PANDAS is a rare condition that is thought to be caused by an autoimmune response to a streptococcal infection, such as strep throat. The exact cause of PANDAS is not fully understood, and it is not caused by vaccines. Motor tics are involuntary, repetitive movements or sounds that can be a symptom of a number of different conditions, including Tourette syndrome, which is a neurological disorder that can cause tics and other behavioral problems.

It is important to note that temporal associations, such as the occurrence of symptoms after receiving a vaccine, do not necessarily imply a causal relationship. It is possible that the flu vaccine and your son's symptoms occurred at the same time by coincidence.

In adequate dose should not have major problems, there are adverse effects seen in blood test only, but in addition to that it is a pretty safe medicinal product. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Jose Mero Santana, General & Family Physician","It is generally recommended that patients taking warfarin switch to a different blood thinner before surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding during the procedure. The specific blood thinner that your healthcare provider has prescribed for you, enoxaparin (brand name Lovenox), is commonly used for this purpose.

Enoxaparin is an injectable blood thinner that is given subcutaneously (under the skin) in the abdominal area. It works by preventing blood clots from forming.

There are some potential side effects associated with enoxaparin, although most people do not experience any problems. Possible side effects include:

Bleeding: As with any blood thinner, the most common side effect of enoxaparin is bleeding. This can occur at the injection site or elsewhere in the body. If you experience bleeding that is severe or persistent, or if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, you should contact your healthcare provider.

Allergic reactions: Some people may experience allergic reactions to enoxaparin, such as hives, rash, or difficulty breathing. If you have a history of allergies or have had an allergic reaction to enoxaparin in the past, be sure to let your healthcare provider know.

Other side effects: Other possible side effects of enoxaparin include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain. These side effects are generally mild and should resolve on their own. If you experience any of these side effects, or if you have any other concerns about your treatment with enoxaparin, you should speak with your healthcare provider.

He went to the ER and they stared giving him antibiotics via an IV.  It's been 24 hours and his fever continues (101.7).  He said he feels terrible.  They just ordered an ultrasound of his bladder, kidneys and prostrate.  What could the problem be?",Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your father might be suffering from urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infections are very common in elderly males due to bening prostatic hypertrophy which causes urinary tract obstruction which leads to stasis of urine in bladder and urine is excellent media for bacteria to grow. I would advise you to get his urine complete examination done along with ultrasound kidney ureter bladder and prostate. In the meanwhile keep him on oral antibiotics preferably from quinolone group.

It is important for your father to continue following the treatment plan recommended by his healthcare provider and to continue taking the prescribed medications as directed. The ultrasound that has been ordered will help provide more information about the underlying cause of your father's symptoms. Some possible causes of fever and burning pain during urination in an older adult include urinary tract infection (UTI), bladder inflammation (cystitis), kidney infection (pyelonephritis), and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland). UTIs are a common cause of these symptoms in older adults and can be treated with antibiotics. Other causes may require additional treatment.

Suggest treatment for low sperm countDr im arulmozhi 30 yrs old. Im having normal periods and was advised for an IUI. My lh level was 11. So im advised to take duoluton tablet. I took 3 tablets for 3 days n I stopped it. 10 th day I have my periods again. Do I need to take hormone test tomorrow 2nd day. My husband has low sperm count and motility. Im very much afraid of my very soon periods.,"Hallow Dear Arulmozhi,From your history, it appears that your main concern now is additional periods you had. You had taken Tab. Duoluton for 3 days. Duoluton is Progesterone preparation. Progesterone causes secretory changes in the lining of uterus (endometrium). After 3 days you discontinued Duoluton; hence you were expected to get the withdrawal bleeding after 4-7 days, which you got. In fact if you are to be put on Progestational medicine for the support throughout the cycle, I would advise you to go for retroprogesterone preparations throughout the cycle so that they would not hamper egg release. If you discontinue these medicines in between, you will get withdrawal bleeding. Now as far as the low sperm count of your husband is concerned, your doctors have suggested you and taken the decision of IUI which you should follow. Please start ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. When the follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm size AND the endometrial thickness is between 9 mm to 14 mm, it is the most ideal time for IUI. So follow these instructions. You need not be afraid for that additional 'period' since it was due to discontinuation of Duoluton. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri","It's important to speak with a healthcare professional about the best course of treatment for low sperm count and motility. Treatment options may include medication, lifestyle changes, or assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).

It's also important to determine the underlying cause of the low sperm count and motility. Possible causes can include hormonal imbalances, infections, structural abnormalities, and certain medications or lifestyle factors. A healthcare professional will be able to evaluate your husband's specific situation and suggest appropriate treatment options.

If you are concerned about your upcoming menstrual cycle, it would be best to speak with your healthcare provider about your concerns. They will be able to advise you on the best course of action based on your specific situation.",,medicine,23176
"Suggest remedy for severe shin painStarting last night, in the night, I started having pain in my left shin. It s tender to the touch. I m not a runner.

With the ice pack.",dear sir/ madami would like to know if you are able to walk?if i were your treating doctor i would examine leg for bony tenderness and ask for the radiograph of the part to look for stress fracture in tibia.,"It's important to take care of shin pain as soon as possible to prevent it from worsening or leading to other injuries. Here are some things you can try to help relieve the pain and swelling in your shin:

Rest: Avoid activities that put pressure on your shin, such as running or playing tennis, until the pain has subsided.

Ice: Apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel to your shin for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. This can help reduce swelling and numb the area to reduce pain.

Compression: Use an elastic bandage or compression sock to help reduce swelling and support the area.

Elevation: Keep your shin elevated above your heart to help reduce swelling.

Over-the-counter pain medication: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen can help reduce pain and inflammation.

If the pain persists or is severe, it is important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. It is possible that you may have a shin splint or a stress fracture, which will require more specific treatment.",,medicine,23150
"Is heart palpitation interconnected to blood in stool?I have been suffering from heart palpitations for more than 3 years, but now they have gotten worse i-e 120-140 bpm with a simplest activity (standing,walking etc). Recently, i noticed blood in my stool.My question is, are these symptoms interconnected?","Dear Patient,      Thank you very much for your question. According to American heart association, normal healthy heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not engaged in a physical activity. If your heart rate is 100 bpm or above while you are resting and relaxed it is called as tachycardia. However, If you engage in any physical activity your heart rate can race up. That is normal.  Subtracting your age from 220 you can find out your maximum heart rate. For instance, If you are 50 years old, your maximum heart rate is 220-50= 170 bpm. Anyway in your condition, I would recommend that you consult your family doctor for a physical examination and proper consultation. I am sure your family doctor will direct you to a  normal ECG test and stress ECG or exercise ECG test to rule out some pathologies appearing during physical activities. Also he or she may direct you to a holter monitor test if necessary to rule out some arrhythmias.  Conditions like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter can cause very high pulse rate like yours and sometimes for that cause is hyperthyroidism. Therefore, you might need to check your thyroid function too.               Concerning your blood in stool, I think it might be as a result of gastrointestinal pathology and I hardly believe it is  related to your high pulse rate.Also I want to ask you the color of blood you noticed on your stool. Red color fresh blood on stool can be due to hemorrhoids or due to hard stool passage  while black stool can be as a result of hemorrhage due to ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis etc.  In order to diagnose these conditions, again you have to do a stool test and explain all other symptoms you have. You may need to undergo an endoscopy if your physician wants to rule out above mentioned diseases.  I think your blood in stool may be related to a gastrointestinal pathology.Therefore, I will highly recommend that you consult your family doctor for proper consultation,diagnosis and treatment.  I hope that I've answered your question. If you have any further questions,please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD","Heart palpitations and blood in the stool are not directly related, but they can both be symptoms of underlying health issues. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider about any new or concerning symptoms you are experiencing, as they can help determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment.

Heart palpitations are sensations that can feel like your heart is racing, skipping a beat, or fluttering. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco use, certain medications, and medical conditions such as anemia, thyroid disorders, and heart disease.

By trimming you will get rid of itching and boils for ever, unless you injure while trimming. Hope this helps you. Please let me know.","It is common for the skin in the pubic area to become dry and itchy after shaving. This can be due to irritation caused by the shaving process, as well as the use of soap or other products that may strip the skin of its natural oils. To help soothe dry, itchy skin in the pubic area, you can try the following:

Avoid shaving too often: Shaving can irritate the skin, so try to limit how often you shave to every week or two.

Use a gentle, moisturizing soap: Choose a soap that is designed for sensitive skin and that contains moisturizing ingredients. Avoid using soap that is too harsh or that contains fragrances, as these can further irritate the skin.

Pat the skin dry after bathing: Avoid rubbing the skin dry after bathing, as this can further irritate the skin. Instead, gently pat the skin dry with a towel.

Apply a moisturizer: Use a moisturizing cream or lotion to help soothe and hydrate the skin. Look for products that contain ingredients like shea butter or aloe vera, which can help to soothe and nourish the skin.

If you notice any bumps or other abnormalities in the skin that are not improving with these self-care measures, it is a good idea to see a healthcare provider for further evaluation. They can assess your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment.",,medicine,23226

It is often accompanied by symptoms such as bloating, heartburn, and nausea.

There are a number of things you can try to relieve indigestion:

Avoid trigger foods: Certain foods and drinks, such as fatty or spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol, can contribute to indigestion. Try to avoid or limit these foods to see if your symptoms improve.

Eat smaller, more frequent meals: Overeating or eating too quickly can cause indigestion. Try eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day to allow your stomach time to digest.

Avoid lying down after eating: Try to wait at least three hours after eating before lying down or going to bed. This can help prevent the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus.

Stay upright after eating: Sitting up or standing can help keep stomach acid in the stomach, where it belongs.

Try over-the-counter remedies: Antacids, such as Tums or Rolaids, can help neutralize stomach acid and provide temporary relief. H-2 receptor blockers, such as Zantac or Pepcid, can also help reduce acid production in the stomach.

If your indigestion persists or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or black stools, it is important to see a doctor for further evaluation.",,medicine,24254

If you have already started having symptoms of overdose then it should be an alarming sign.You should immediately consult an Emergency room and get yourself checked.The vitals needs to be monitored, the doses that you have taken will be checked and in case if the doses are too heavily taken then you needs to be admitted and proper management should be done to excrete the drugs out out the body using i.v lines and injectables.Do not delay to avoid any medical emergency. Hope this helps. RegardsDr. Honey Arora, Dentist","I'm sorry to hear that you are experiencing tooth pain and are concerned about an overdose. It's important to seek medical attention if you think you may have taken too much of any medication. Overdosing on ibuprofen or acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Anadin) can be dangerous and may cause serious side effects, including stomach bleeding, kidney damage, and liver damage.

If you are experiencing symptoms of an overdose, such as nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, and difficulty breathing, you should seek immediate medical attention. Call your local emergency number (such as 911 in the US) or go to the nearest emergency room. Do not try to treat an overdose on your own.

To treat your toothache, it is important to identify the cause of the pain and address it. Some possible causes of toothache include tooth decay, a broken or cracked tooth, gum disease, or an abscess (a pocket of pus that can form around the tooth). A dentist or oral healthcare professional will be able to diagnose the cause of your toothache and recommend treatment options, which may include filling a cavity, repairing a damaged tooth, treating gum disease, or draining an abscess.

In the meantime, you can try some home remedies to help manage the pain. Here are a few suggestions:

Rinse your mouth with warm water to clean the area and help reduce swelling.
Place a cold compress on your cheek to help reduce swelling and numb the pain.
Take over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as directed on the package. Be sure to follow the dosing instructions carefully and do not exceed the recommended dose.

How to cure seizures permanently?My daughter has taken Topamax for seizures. She quit taken the meds several months ago and her seizures are coming back more frequently then before. She said her insurance will not cover them anymore. What should I do ? She just had another seizure today.,"welcome to HCM!From my clinical expeirnece I can tell you that your daughter should start the medicine as soon as possible. As you mentioned that her seizures are back with more intensity, and the nature is different now, so , you should preffrably  see a neurologist and take consultation before starting drugs. She should also get an MRI brain to rule out any organicity, get her liver function test and blood counts (prior to starting drugs). I know it is very difficult to take long term medication but it is really important for her to remain seizure free. Every seizure destroys some brain cells, and thereby making her prone to get more of them. Apart from drugs you should see that she dosent drive for some time now, operates machinery under supervision.Please try to cut expenses on other things and ask her to take medicine, she needs them. Donot stop the drugs without consulting the doctor.Hope the reply is usefulDr. Manisha Gopal","I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's seizures. Seizures can be a serious condition, and it's important to seek medical treatment to find the best course of action for managing them. It's not uncommon for people with epilepsy to experience seizures even while taking medication, and it's important to work with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for treating seizures, as the best approach will depend on the individual's specific needs and medical history. In some cases, medication can be effective in controlling seizures, while in other cases, surgery or other treatments may be necessary.

If your daughter's insurance is no longer covering the medication she has been taking, it's important to speak with her healthcare provider to determine the best course of action. They may be able to recommend alternative medications that are covered by your insurance, or they may suggest other treatment options. It's also important to make sure that your daughter is seeing a healthcare provider regularly to monitor her condition and make any necessary adjustments to her treatment plan.

In the meantime, it's important to take steps to ensure your daughter's safety during a seizure, such as removing any potential hazards from the area and placing her in a safe position. It's also a good idea to have a seizure action plan in place in case of future seizures. This should include the contact information for your daughter's healthcare provider and any other important information, such as what to do if she has a prolonged seizure.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions or concerns, I encourage you to speak with your daughter's healthcare provider for more personalized guidance.",,medicine,23726

Who Moved My Cheese Synopsis,"It describes change in one's work and life, and four typical reactions to said change by two mice and two ""littlepeople"", during their hunt for cheese .","""Who Moved My Cheese?"" is a parable about change written by Dr. Spencer Johnson. The story follows two mice, Sniff and Scurry, and two little people, Hem and Haw, as they search for cheese in a maze. The cheese represents something that the characters desire, whether it be a job, a relationship, or something else.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, Sniff and Scurry and Hem and Haw all find cheese in the same place in the maze. However, one day the cheese is gone. Sniff and Scurry quickly adapt and go out into the maze to find more cheese, while Hem and Haw struggle to come to terms with the change and try to find the cheese in the same place where it used to be.\n\nAs the story goes on, Hem and Haw eventually come to realize that the cheese has truly disappeared and that they need to adapt and move on.

how does weather happen,Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another.,"Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time, including temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and wind conditions. It is caused by a combination of factors, including the Earth's rotation, the movement of air masses, the Earth's distance from the sun, and the Earth's surface features.\n\nOne of the main factors that drives weather is the Earth's rotation on its axis, which causes different parts of the Earth to receive more or less solar radiation at different times of the year. This is what causes the seasons.\n\nAnother important factor is the movement of air masses. Air masses are large bodies of air that have similar temperature and humidity characteristics. These air masses can move from one place to another, bringing different weather conditions with them. For example, an air mass that is warm and moist will bring with it a period of warm, humid weather, while an air mass that is cold and dry will bring cooler, dry weather.\n\nThe Earth's distance from the sun also plays a role in the weather. The Earth is closest to the sun in January and farthest from the sun in July. This difference in distance from the sun affects the amount of solar radiation that the Earth receives, which in turn affects the temperature and weather patterns.\n\nFinally, the Earth's surface features, such as mountains, oceans, and forests, can also influence the weather. For example, mountains can block the movement of air masses, causing weather patterns to change as the air masses move around the obstacles. Similarly, oceans can store heat and release it slowly over time, which can affect the temperature and humidity of the air masses that pass over them.",,open_qa,18087

when us subprime mortgage market collapse,The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was a set of events and conditions that led to a financial crisis and subsequent recession that began in 2008.,"The subprime mortgage market in the United States collapsed in 2007, leading to a global financial crisis. The crisis was sparked by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, which was fueled by risky lending practices and a housing bubble.\n\nSubprime mortgages are home loans made to borrowers with poor credit history or low income, who may not qualify for a traditional mortgage. These loans often have higher interest rates and less favorable terms than prime mortgages.\n\nDuring the housing boom of the early 2000s, subprime mortgages became increasingly popular as a way for people to buy homes they otherwise couldn't afford. However, many of these borrowers were unable to make their monthly mortgage payments, and as a result, the value of the underlying assets (i.e., the homes) declined.\n\nThis caused a chain reaction that led to the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the financial crisis.

when did classification of races begin,"First used to denote national affiliations, the term began to be used to relate to physical traits in the 17th century.","Classification of races, or the categorization of human populations into distinct groups based on physical or biological traits, has a long history that dates back to ancient civilizations. The ancient Egyptians, for example, divided people into categories based on their skin color, while the ancient Greeks classified people based on their physical characteristics and cultural practices.\n\nThe concept of race as we understand it today, however, has its roots in the European exploration and colonization of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. During this period, European scientists and philosophers sought to understand and classify the diversity of human populations they encountered, and they used various physical and cultural characteristics to create categories or ""races."" This process was often motivated by a desire to justify European colonialism and the exploitation of non-European peoples.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of race was further developed and codified by scientists and scholars who sought to use biological and genetic characteristics to define racial categories. These efforts were often driven by a belief in the superiority of certain racial groups and the use of scientific terminology and methods to support these beliefs.\n\nToday, the concept of race is still used in various contexts, but it is widely recognized that it is a social construct rather than a scientifically valid way of categorizing human populations. Many scientists and scholars argue that race has no biological basis and that it is a product of social, cultural, and political factors.",,open_qa,17453

How did different races begin ? I ve been reading about how life began on earth and the different theories about it . I have been trying to understand how different races came to be but I could n't find anything that makes sense . Please explain like I'm five.,"Setting aside the terminology of "" race "" , it 's entirely down to selective pressures of the different environments . In equatorial regions where the sun is plentiful , having a lot of melanin is useful in protecting against cancer . The further north / south you go from there , the less sun there is , so having less melanin is useful in absorbing vitamin D from the sun . In high altitude regions where the atmosphere is more rarefied , having a more efficient respiratory system is useful .","Different races of people, or human populations with distinct physical characteristics, developed over time due to a variety of factors, including geographical isolation, natural selection, and cultural influences. The process of how different races formed is complex and varied, and there is still much that scientists do not understand about it.One theory is that different human populations evolved physical characteristics that were well-suited to the environments in which they lived. For example, people who lived in hot, sunny regions may have evolved darker skin to protect against the harmful effects of the sun's rays, while people who lived in colder regions may have evolved lighter skin to help them produce more vitamin D from sunlight.Another factor that may have contributed to the development of different races is geographical isolation. When different groups of people are isolated from one another for long periods of time, they may develop unique physical characteristics due to the effects of natural selection. This is the process by which certain traits become more common in a population because they help the people who have them survive and reproduce more successfully.Finally, cultural influences such as intermarriage and migration can also play a role in the development of different races. When different groups of people come into contact with one another and have children together, their offspring may have a mixture of physical characteristics from both groups. Similarly, when people from one group move to a new area and have children with people from that area, their offspring may have a mixture of physical characteristics from both groups.I hope this helps!

That 's obviously not true , but if you replace "" inch "" with a very small distance , you 'll get the gist of the thing .

So the smart money is still on space being continuous , not discrete .","Scientists can't definitively prove whether or not we are living in a computer simulation, but they can try to find evidence that would support or contradict the idea.

One way to find out if we are in a simulation is to look for signs that the world around us is not real. For example, if the world was a computer simulation, there might be certain patterns or abnormalities in the way things behave. Scientists could try to look for these patterns by studying the laws of physics or by looking for unusual behavior in the natural world.

Another way scientists might try to find out if we are in a simulation is by trying to create their own simulations of the world. If they can create a simulation that is very similar to the real world, it would suggest that it is possible for our world to be a simulation as well.

Ultimately, it is difficult to say for sure whether or not we are living in a computer simulation. However, scientists will continue to search for evidence and try to understand more about the world around us.",,reddit_eli5,16456

"What would happen if a syringe of water was injected into your veins ? Say you were prepping for surgery , what would happen if instead of anaesthetic , you were injected with water , in both small quantities and say a syringe full or more ? Please explain like I'm five.","If plain water were injected into a vein it would dilute the contents of the plasma ( mainly electrolytes like sodium and chloride , and proteins ) in that local area . Through a process called osmosis a portion of the water would fairly rapidly be drawn into nearby cells , in particular the red blood cells . Many of these cells would expand in volume rapidly to the point that their cell membranes would rupture , spilling their contents into the circulation . For a very small amount of water there would be no lasting harm . As the amount increases more red cells would be damaged . The harm from this falls into two categories - as you lose red blood cells , your blood is less able to carry oxygen to other parts of the body , and the substances leaking from the injured cells would in large enough quantities cause harm themselves since the balance of what is kept inside and outside of these cells is delicate and well regulated . If , instead of plain water , water with solutes in roughly the same concentration as the plasma was introduced ( such as "" normal saline "" ) , and the quantities were not ridiculous , then it would simply become part of your circulating blood volume . Over time the extra fluid would end up dividing between your circulating blood volume , the insides of various cells , and the fluid that surrounds cells in your body outside of the circulation . This scenario is common - for example , small volumes of saline are usually used to flush medications given through an intravenous line in order to make sure all of it enters the blood at the time it was intended to be given .","If a syringe of water were injected into your veins, it would not be harmful in small quantities. However, injecting a large amount of water into your veins can be dangerous because it can cause your blood cells to become diluted. This can lead to a condition called hyponatremia, which occurs when the sodium levels in your blood become too low.

Why does my dog pick up sticks in her mouth and carry them around ? Does n't it taste bad ? Explain like I'm five.,"When dogs were first domesticated a long , long time ago they were primarily used for hunting for quite some time . After a few millennia of evolution we bred a lot of hunting based instincts into them , one of those being retrieving prey for their master . Basically , when your dog brings a stick to you it 's simulating bringing a hunted animal to you . If the dog wants you to throw it , it 's mimicking it 's natural impulse to chase after prey . If the dog wants to play tug of war with it , it simulates the prey fighting back or something trying to steal it away . ( Fun fact , if your dog ever violently shakes it head back and forth it 's trying to break the prey 's neck ) In summary , playing fetch or tug of war mimics the actions we selectively bred dogs to accomplish and gratifies them .","Dogs have a natural instinct to carry things in their mouths, especially things like sticks. It's a behavior that comes from their ancestors, who would carry food back to their dens or hunt for prey. Dogs might also pick up sticks because they like the way it feels to have something in their mouths, or because they want to play with something.

As for the taste of sticks, it's possible that they don't taste particularly good to your dog, but it's also possible that your dog doesn't really care. Dogs will sometimes eat and chew on things that humans might not consider tasty, especially if they are bored or if they want to explore their environment.

In fact, most DNA mutations do not cause any significant problems or diseases. However, some DNA mutations can cause problems with the way cells function, and can lead to the development of cancer. 
Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. Normal cells in the body follow a specific pattern of growth and division, but cancer cells do not. They continue to grow and divide even when the body does not need them, and they do not die when they should. This can lead to the formation of tumors, which can be harmful if they grow in certain parts of the body or if they spread to other parts of the body. 
There are many different factors that can increase the risk of developing cancer, including genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle factors. DNA mutations can play a role in the development of cancer, but they are not the only cause.

Keep in mind that the designations of "" north "" and "" south "" are human - made , you could easily swap the names around or flip the map : URL_0","There is more land mass in the Northern Hemisphere for a few reasons. One reason is that the Earth is not perfectly round - it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. This means that the Northern Hemisphere has a slightly larger surface area than the Southern Hemisphere. Another reason is that the Earth's land masses are not evenly distributed around the globe. Pangaea, which was a supercontinent that existed about 200 million years ago, was located mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. When Pangaea broke apart, the land masses moved and formed the continents we have today, but the majority of them are still located in the Northern Hemisphere. The concentration of land mass in the Northern Hemisphere can affect weather patterns. Land masses can affect temperature and humidity because they absorb and release heat differently than oceans. Land masses also affect wind patterns because they can block or divert the flow of air. The Northern Hemisphere has more land masses, so the weather there might be affected more by these factors.",,reddit_eli5,11916

That being said, it is possible for animals to become distressed or depressed, just as humans can. For example, if an animal experiences trauma or loss, they may show signs of sadness or lethargy. However, it is not accurate to say that animals can consciously decide to end their own lives in the way that humans can.

How did US voters figure out which presidential candidate was the best in the early days of America ? ...

The parties would also hold debates and discussions to help party members decide who they thought would be the best candidate.In the early days of America, many people got their information about the candidates from newspapers and pamphlets, as well as from talking to friends and neighbors. Some people might also have heard the candidates speak in person at events or rallies.Today, the process for choosing a presidential candidate is a bit more complicated. Political parties still hold conventions, but they also have primary elections and caucuses where voters can cast their ballots for the candidate they prefer.

( And this is n't entirely without merit ; North Korea may not be democratic , but the government we set up in South Korea * was * a dictatorship until very recently . )","There are many complex factors that have contributed to the strained relationship between the United States and North Korea. Here is a simplified explanation:

North Korea is a country in East Asia that has been ruled by the same family (the Kims) for several generations. The current leader, Kim Jong-un, is the grandson of the country's founder, Kim Il-sung.

The United States is a country located in North America that has a long history of political and military involvement in other parts of the world. The United States and North Korea have had a difficult relationship for many years, partly because they have different political systems and values.

One of the main issues between the United States and North Korea is the issue of nuclear weapons. North Korea has developed nuclear weapons, which the United States and many other countries see as a threat to global security. The United States has also imposed economic sanctions on North Korea in an effort to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.

Another factor that has contributed to the strained relationship is the fact that North Korea has a history of human rights abuses. The North Korean government has been accused of violating the rights of its own citizens, including political prisoners and people who try to leave the country without permission.

It's important to note that the relationship between the United States and North Korea is complex, and there are many other factors that have contributed to the tension between the two countries.

Arguments for and against The Federal Reserve . I know there are some politicians who want to dismantle it while others see it being vital for the nation . I want to better understand both sides of the argument . Explain like I'm five.,"I 'll take the "" pro - federal reserve "" side of the question , I 'll let somebody else handle the anti - federal - reserve side . So let 's say there 's three guys on an island , Fred the Farmer , Tom the Tailor , and Chad the Carpenter . But today , they have a problem . Fred needs clothes from Tom . Tom needs his roof fixed by Chad . Chad needs some food from Fred . Unfortunately , when Fred bumps into Tom , they fail to make a deal , because Tom needs Chad 's help , not Fred 's help . That 's the problem with "" barter , "" which is direct trading . If you bump into somebody , and they have exactly what you need , unless you also have exactly what they need , you ca n't make a deal ! The likelihood that two people will bump into each other , and they both have exactly what the other person needs , is pretty slim . These three guys , together , have everything they need . But they ca n't organize a trade . So that 's why money exists : to help people trade . Let 's say they get together and make three "" dollars "" using three slips of paper and a green pen . They each get a dollar , and they each agree that they 'll accept a dollar for whatever it is they do . Now here 's what happens : Fred bumps into Tom , and buys clothes for a dollar . Then , Tom bumps into Chad and buys a roof repair for a dollar . Then , Chad bumps into Fred , and buys food for a dollar . Now everyone has what they need . Interestingly , everyone still has a dollar . Now for a while , life is good . The three of them buy thousands of dollars worth of stuff from each other , using their three bills . This is possible because when you use dollars , they 're not used up - they just circulate . Each bill can be used over and over . But one day , a new person , Mary , lands on the island . She has a ship full of video games , food and clothes . And she lives on her ship ! So she does n't need anything from these three guys at all . But she 's nice , so she offers a video game each to Tom , Chad , and Fred . She accepts a dollar from each of them , even though she does n't really need Fred 's food , Tom 's clothes , or Chad 's repairs . She figures she 'll hold onto the dollars , because maybe she 'll want sexual favors later . Now Mary has three dollars , and the other guys have nothing . Then , all of a sudden , Fred needs clothes from Tom again . Tom needs his roof fixed by Chad again . Chad needs some food from Fred again . But Mary has all the dollars ! So they go to Mary , and they try to get some dollars from her . But Mary has everything she needs . She still has a ship full of video games , her home is in great shape , her clothes are nice , and her fridge is full of food . She thanks the guys for the kind offer , but she decides to keep the three dollars in case she needs them later . She 's not being mean , she 's just being sensible . But Fred , Tom , and Chad are in a bind . Fred , Tom , and Chad want to trade with each other . They have plenty of stuff : Fred still has food , Tom still has clothes , and Chad still can fix houses . But they have no dollars . They vaguely remember that it 's possible to trade without dollars , and they consider going back to the barter system . But that 's a bad idea . If they 're smart , they 'll get out their paper and green pen again . It would be silly for them to go back to barter , when they have a better way . When this whole thing started , they just made the dollars . They can do it again , and they 'd be foolish not to . Mary will be angry , because she gave up three video games for her three dollars , and the three guys will just be making dollars "" for free "" using paper and pen . She has a point . She correctly thinks that her three dollars might be seen as less valuable , if they are n't the only dollars around . But it 's also not reasonable for Mary to expect Fred , Tom , and Chad to go back to the barter system . They need to compromise . The Federal Reserve 's job is to balance those two needs against each other . Chad , Fred , and Tom need to have enough dollars to be able to trade without bartering , but then again , the reserve should n't make so many dollars that Mary 's money becomes worthless . Now , some people think there should n't be a federal reserve . In that case , Mary would have the dollars , and that would be that . Fred , Chad , and Tom would have to go back to bartering with each other .","Sure! The Federal Reserve, also known as the ""Fed,"" is the central bank of the United States. It is responsible for implementing monetary policy, which is the way that the government and the Fed try to control the supply of money and credit in the economy in order to achieve certain goals like low unemployment and stable prices. Here are some arguments for and against the Fed: FOR: The Fed helps to stabilize the economy by using tools like setting interest rates and controlling the money supply to try to keep prices stable and unemployment low. The Fed can act as a ""lender of last resort"" by providing loans to banks during times of financial crisis, which can help to prevent or mitigate severe economic downturns. The Fed is independent of political influence, which some people argue makes it better able to make decisions that are in the best interest of the economy as a whole, rather than being swayed by short-term political considerations. AGAINST: Some people argue that the Fed has too much power and that it is not accountable to the public. They may also argue that the Fed's decisions can have negative consequences, such as causing asset bubbles or leading to high inflation. Some people believe that the Fed is secretive and that it is not transparent about its decision-making processes. Some people argue that the Fed is not necessary and that the government should be responsible for regulating the money supply and setting interest rates. They may also argue that the Fed's actions can lead to inequities, such as benefiting certain groups or industries over others. Overall, there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate about the role and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve. It is up to each individual to decide which arguments they find most persuasive.",246.0,reddit_eli5,1853

Because 9gag users often use their Facebook accounts to post and comment , their stolen , watermarked images end up on Facebook quite often . As unpleasant as their business model is , their users are the main reason they get hate .

Is it Possible that Iran has a Legitimate Need for Nuclear Power ? Considering they have vast petroleum reserves in the ground . Explain like I'm five.,"Of course Iran has a legitimate need for nuclear power . Oil used for power generation is oil we ca n't use for anything else . Fossil fuels are expensive , nuclear power is ( relatively ) inexpensive . Iran has ~77 million people , Germany has just over 80 , and France and the UK are both in the 60 's . So Iran is a decent sized country , they need more power to develop , fossil fuels they use for their own purposes are fossil fuels they can not sell . That does n't mean they need slightly enriched uranium ( they do n't really need enriched uranium at all ) , that does n't mean they need plutonium etc . Which would be for nuclear weapons . But of course they need those too , as Israel has them , Pakistan has them and appears to have an agreement to sell them to Saudi ( saudi being an enemy of Iran ) and the US has them . If you want to ensure sovereignty of your country you need to point nuclear weapons at Washington , Los angles and New York . Japan has about 127 million people , so it 's a fair bit bigger than Iran , but they have turned off ALL of their nuclear power . That has made them post their first trade deficit in 28 years . Oil and Natural gas are expensive , Iran is better to have some nuclear power and sell more of those to everyone else . The thing with nuclear power is that it has a long deep and complex pipeline to get going , along with the political squabbling . Iran is going to want wind power and solar power too .

So the long and the short of it , and there 's a lot of complexity to it when you 're talking about foreign trade versus domestic construction etc . but yes , basically every country that can not power itself exclusively on hydroelectric power has a legitimate use for nuclear power .","Yes, it is possible that Iran has a legitimate need for nuclear power. Just because a country has abundant reserves of one type of energy source, such as petroleum, does not necessarily mean that it cannot also benefit from using other types of energy.

Nuclear power is a form of energy that is produced by splitting atoms in a process called nuclear fission. This can generate a large amount of electricity, which can be used to power homes, businesses, and other facilities.

One reason that Iran might have a need for nuclear power is that it is a rapidly growing country with a large population. As more and more people need electricity to power their homes and businesses, it can be helpful to have a diverse mix of energy sources to meet that demand.

Another reason is that nuclear power can be a relatively clean and safe way to generate electricity. Unlike fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases when they are burned, nuclear power does not produce any air pollution. This can be important for protecting the environment and public health.

It's worth noting that the use of nuclear power is not without risks. For example, there is a risk of nuclear accidents, and the disposal of nuclear waste can also be a challenge. However, with proper safety measures in place, nuclear power can be a valuable addition to a country's energy mix.",,reddit_eli5,9170

Poking this type of screen with any object wo n't create a touch as it is n't detecting the physical pressure . Try using something organic like a fruit , or even a bag of water and you will be able to interact with the screen . Of course some styluses are designed to work on this type of screen .","Touch screens work by detecting the touch of a finger or a stylus on the screen. When you touch the screen with your finger or a stylus, the screen detects the touch and sends a signal to the device's processor. The processor then determines what action to take based on where you touched the screen. You can use a stylus on your 3DS because it has a special type of touch screen that is designed to detect the touch of a stylus. However, you cannot use a stylus on your iPhone because it has a different type of touch screen that is only designed to detect the touch of a finger. I hope this helps to explain how touch screens work! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.",,reddit_eli5,13330
"What happens to the old organs of a person receiving a donor transplant ? I ca n't imagine them being dumped on the local waste disposal , so I wondered where they actually go . Please explain like I'm five.","They go through pathology to better understand the level of disease / damage , then they are disposed of as biological hazardous waste , which means they go to a special incinerator before being dumped .","When a person receives a donor organ transplant, the old organ is not thrown away like garbage. Instead, it is carefully removed from the person's body and handled with respect, because it once played an important role in their body. After the old organ is removed, it is usually examined by doctors to see if there are any problems or diseases that could be learned from. Then, the organ is disposed of in a way that is respectful and safe for the environment. So, you see, the old organs are not just thrown away carelessly, but are treated with care and respect even after they are no longer needed by the person who received the transplant.",,reddit_eli5,7023
How / when did liking anime become associated with sexual deviance and poor social skills ? Is this the reputation it has in Japan as well ?

Why is Italy rarely as mentioned when talking abiut ths Axis Powers ? Whenever I hear things about WW2 its always about fighting the Japanese or German but almost never Italy . Please explain like I'm five.,"The Italian people revolted and ousted Mussolini from power when the war turned against them , and afterwards helped support the Allied war effort against Germany . As a result , they tended not to get demonized as much in post - war propaganda as Germany and Japan did .","Italy was one of the three main Axis Powers during World War II, along with Germany and Japan. However, Italy was not as powerful as Germany or Japan, and it was not as heavily involved in the fighting as those countries were. Italy's military and industrial capabilities were not as strong as those of Germany or Japan, and its leaders were more focused on territorial expansion in Africa and the Mediterranean than on global domination. As a result, Italy played a smaller role in the overall course of the war compared to Germany and Japan. That's why Italy is not mentioned as often when people talk about the Axis Powers.",,reddit_eli5,6772
"In a motorcycle transmission , why is Neutral almost always between 1st and 2nd gear ? and why is n't it before 1st , would n't that make more sense ? Explain like I'm five.","So that when you 're emergency braking and shift down ( down , down , down , down , down ) you end up in 1st , rather than neutral . This way , once you 're done braking and look behind you to see some guy in a truck that may not be able to stop as fast as you , you can go ( rather than trying to shift into first before taking off ) .","In a motorcycle transmission, the gears are arranged in a specific order so that when you shift from one gear to another, the engine's RPM (rotations per minute) stays in a suitable range. If the RPM gets too low, the engine will stall. If the RPM gets too high, the engine could be damaged.

Neutral is usually between 1st and 2nd gear because it's a place where the engine's RPM is usually low enough that it won't stall, but high enough that you can easily shift into 1st or 2nd gear when you want to start moving again.

If Neutral were before 1st gear, the engine's RPM might be too low to easily shift into 1st gear. This could make it more difficult to start moving again after you've stopped.

"How do audio and video codecs work , and why do we need them ? I 'd like to gain a basic understanding of audio and video codecs . Explain like I'm five.","Do you want to know about the theory behind them , or about which ones are better in which situations and how to use them ? Video is a series of still images ( called * frames * ) played rapidly in a row . Most commonly , people will use 24 frames per second ( * 24fps * ) for video ; that 's 24 still images played quickly enough that it seems like smooth motion . Each of these images is made up from many tiny coloured squares , called * pixels * . Think of a [ mosaic art piece ] ( URL_0 ) ; the more pieces of mosaic -- pixels -- you use , the more detailed the image can be . The number of pixels used in an image is called its * resolution * . To illustrate the differences in resolution : a DVD has 345,600 pixels per frame , HDTV has around 921,000 , and Blu - ray has over 2 million . For every second of video you see on a Bluray , the player is putting 49.76 million tiny coloured squares on the screen in a specific order . That 's a * lot * of information . The player would have to say "" Put a red square first . Then a blue square . Then a yellow square . Then a green square "" to the TV almost 50 million times a second . When it 's speaking in plain English like that , just saying what squares go where , we call it * uncompressed video * . Uncompressed Blu - ray video takes up 149.3 megabytes per second ( without even counting audio ) . * Codecs * are our solution to that problem . They * encode * the video -- that is , they turn that list of "" Put red square here "" plain - English instructions into a special kind of code that 's a lot faster and takes less space to store . They will also change parts of the video to make it easier to describe in this code . One trick they might use is to keep non - moving portions of the screen static . Imagine your video is a Simpsons episode where Homer is mowing the lawn . Your uncompressed video , which does n't use a codec , will describe every single part of the scene 24 times per second , using a LOT of space . You use a clever codec that says "" Oh , look -- * Homer and the lawnmower * are moving , but the house stays perfectly still in the background . We 'll describe the house once , and just say * keep that on the screen for 10 seconds * , so we do n't have to keep describing it over and over . "" You 've saved a lot of space that way . Likewise , while your uncompressed video describes Homer 's face as "" yellow pixel , then yellow pixel , then yellow pixel , then yellow pixel "" over and over again a million times , your clever new codec would say "" Repeat yellow pixel 500 times "" , saving space . It might even say , depending on what codec you 've chosen and what settings it has , "" That tree in the background is made up of 500 shades of green , but let 's trim that down to 300 shades , it wo n't look that much different but it 'll save some more space . "" After enough of these tricks , your 900 GB video is down to 8 GB , small enough to put on a DVD . Why are there so many different codecs ? Well , it takes a lot of computer brainpower to process a video using an advanced codec . Back in 1990 , when computers were slow and computers were just starting out , they would 've made quite simple codecs that did n't take a million years for the computer to understand . Now in 2011 , because our computers are hundreds of times faster , we can write new codecs that employ very in - depth and complicated tricks . Our priorities have also changed -- now that we can stream videos online without worry , and now that we have 2 TB hard drives instead of 2 GB ones , we prefer to have big - but - pretty videos , while 1990s folks wanted to keep them as small as they possibly could . The codec used on DVDs is called MPEG-2 . MPEG-2 dates from 1996 , and was written with the goal of being decoded by cheap , low - power DVD players , so it 's not very thorough or clever . The codec used on Blu - ray , iTunes video and many online sites is called H.264 or AVC . It is much newer , and was written knowing that it would be used on the strong computers of the late 2000s , rather than low - power devices from the mid-90s . As such , it is much smarter and more powerful -- because it knows it 'll be played by powerful processors -- and provides a much higher quality of video . If you yourself are looking to encode video , the three most popular codec formats are * * MPEG-2 * * ( used only for DVDs nowadays ) , * * Xvid * * ( used in the AVI files you find online , good for making sure everyone can see it , or that it can be played on phones and other low - power devices ) and * * H.264 * * ( used for most online , Blu - ray , and HD videos ; the best choice in 95 % of cases ) . Now , as a footnote , let 's note what a * container format * is . Many people are confused by this . Containers are things like AVI , MKV , or MP4 . These file extensions do not tell you what codec was used to make the video . Think of them more like ZIP files . Most video files contain the video , one or two audio tracks , maybe some subtitles , and some chapters . Each of those things is a separate piece , in a different format , messily separated . So you put them together into a * container * , one file that contains them all , just like ZIP . The exact same video can be represented inside an AVI , an MKV , or an MP4 , but they have different features . For example , AVI is 20 years old , made specially for Windows , and only really supports one video with one piece of audio on the top -- but everyone can view it . MKV is more modern , and supports multiple viewing angles , chapters like a DVD , built - in subtitles , multiple audio tracks ( so you can embed director 's commentary or different languages ) , but because it 's relatively modern , older software does n't know how to deal with it . When you make a video , you choose what container you want based on your needs , but it has absolutely zero effect on the image quality , and it is very easy to change later . For example , today I made a file where the video format was H.264 , the audio format was MP3 , the subtitle format was SRT , and the container format was MKV . That 's an MKV file , but the * video * is n't MKV , it 's H.264 . MKV 's just the container I put all the stuff in .","Sure! An audio codec is a piece of software that is used to compress and decompress audio files. Audio files, like songs or recordings of people talking, can be very large, so codecs are used to make them smaller and easier to store or transmit. Video codecs work in a similar way, but they are used to compress and decompress video files. Video files, like movies or TV shows, can be even larger than audio files, so codecs are especially important for storing and transmitting them. We need audio and video codecs because it's not practical to store or transmit large audio and video files without compressing them first. For example, it would take a long time to download a movie over the internet if it wasn't compressed with a codec first. Codecs allow us to store and transmit audio and video more efficiently.",884.0,reddit_eli5,2491
Why ca n't a human mind fully imagine the concepts of nothing and infinity ? It is often said that humans can not fully imagine / comprehend / mentally visualize nothingness and infinity . Why is this the case ? Explain like I'm five.,"because humans require contrast . Try to image that when a baby first opens its eyes , it sees a static image . This is because it has no idea of knowing that the cupboard and the door it sees are separate things . Not until the baby moves its head or an object moves around , can the baby deduce that it is not the same thing .","It is difficult for the human mind to fully imagine the concepts of nothingness and infinity because they are abstract and very different from the things that we experience in our everyday lives.

Nothingness is the absence of anything. It is the complete absence of matter, energy, and even space and time. Because we have never experienced anything like this, it is hard for us to fully understand or visualize it.

Infinity is the concept of something that goes on forever and never ends. Again, this is something that is very hard for our minds to grasp because we are used to things having a beginning and an end. It is difficult for us to wrap our minds around the idea of something that never ends.

In general, it is difficult for the human mind to fully understand or visualize abstract concepts like nothingness and infinity because they are so different from the concrete things that we experience in the world around us.",,reddit_eli5,8309
Why do antidepressants cause suicidal thoughts ? I always hear this as one of the side effects of taking an antidepressant in commercials . This seems on par with chemo causing cancer .

They were so common and fleeting that ignoring the suicidal thoughts was easy . Once he started on the medication , the suicidal thoughts were still there , but he could think much more clearly . That meant that the suicidal thoughts were a lot more clear and well defined . Instead of thinking , "" I wish I could die , "" the thoughts become , "" I have a nylon rope in the garage and I could punch out a couple tiles in the garage roof to tie the noose . "" You can make plans and rationalize for possibly the first time in years . That is why suicide happens when people first start taking anti - depressants . Hopefully the person will get a good counselor and discuss the potential effects and be able to offer ways to beat those thoughts .","Antidepressants can sometimes cause suicidal thoughts as a side effect, but it's important to understand that this is rare and that antidepressants are generally safe and effective at helping people who are struggling with depression.

When people are depressed, they may feel very sad, hopeless, and have low energy. Antidepressants are a type of medication that can help lift these feelings and make people feel better. However, in some cases, antidepressants can also cause people to have strange or unusual thoughts, including thoughts of suicide.

It's important to understand that this is a rare side effect and that most people who take antidepressants do not experience suicidal thoughts.

In general, it might be easier to get caught pirating movies or software than it is to get caught pirating songs. This is because movies and software are usually more expensive and the people who own the rights to them are often more aggressive about protecting their rights.

How come perfect eyesight is 20/20 ? And how come the grade increases as eyesight capability decreases ? Do they use the same system for nearsightedness and farsightedness ? Explain like I'm five.,"Eye doctors have decided what a "" normal "" human being should be able to see when standing 20 feet away from an eye chart . If you have 20/20 vision , it means that when you stand 20 feet away from the chart you can see what the "" normal "" or average human being can see . In other words , your vision is "" normal "" -- most people can see what you see at 20 feet . If you have 20/40 vision , it means that when you stand 20 feet away from the chart you can see what a normal human can see when standing 40 feet from the chart . That is , if there is a normal person standing 40 feet away from the chart and you are standing only 20 feet away from it , you and the normal person can see the same detail . 20/100 means that when you stand 20 feet from the chart you can see what a normal person standing 100 feet away can see . 20/200 is the cutoff for legal blindness in the United States . Source URL_0","The term ""20/20"" is used to describe normal vision, which means that a person is able to see clearly at a distance of 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance. It is a standard used to measure visual acuity, which is the clarity or sharpness of your vision.

The first number in the ""20/20"" measurement, which is 20 in this case, refers to the distance at which the measurement is taken (in feet). The second number refers to the distance at which a person with normal vision would be able to see clearly what you can see clearly at 20 feet.

For example, if your vision is 20/40, it means that you need to be as close as 20 feet to see what a person with normal vision can see clearly at a distance of 40 feet. This means that your vision is not as sharp as someone with 20/20 vision.

The same measurement system is used for both nearsightedness and farsightedness. Nearsightedness means that you can see things clearly up close, but things that are farther away appear blurry. Farsightedness means that you can see things clearly from far away, but things that are up close appear blurry.

The genetic mutations that made it possible for people to have lighter skin in colder areas with little light , made it more likely that genetic mutations would occur in other coloring ( such as hair and eye color ) . It was never beneficial for people in warmer / bright climates to have lighter skin , so they do not have the genetic mutations that make it possible for it to occur . In cases where a blond person has children with a brunette , the genes for darker coloring are dominate so the brown eyed / brown hair parent has a better chance of passing their coloring to their child . Since people with darker skin usually do n't have those light coloring mutated genes hanging around their gene pool , it makes it even more likely that light coloring wo n't occur .","Caucasians, people who are generally from Europe, the Middle East, and parts of South Asia, have more diversity in hair and eye color because they have a greater variety of genes.

Darker colored people, like those from Africa or East Asia, also have a variety of genes, but the genes that give rise to lighter hair and eye colors are less common.

Then , they do some math number magic on those variables , making the results look random to some extent . If you want to read some more about random numbers I highly recommend checking out [ this site ] ( URL_0 )","Computers use algorithms, or sets of instructions, to generate random numbers. These algorithms take in a starting number, called a seed, and use it to create a sequence of numbers that appears random.

One common method for generating random numbers is called the linear congruential generator. This method uses a formula to generate a new number based on the previous number in the sequence. The new number is called a pseudorandom number because it appears random, but it is actually generated using a formula.

Another method for generating random numbers is called the Mersenne Twister. This method uses a more complex formula to generate a sequence of pseudorandom numbers.

Although these methods can produce sequences of numbers that appear random, they are not truly random. This is because they are generated using a formula, and it is possible for someone to figure out the formula and predict the next number in the sequence.

In some cases, truly random numbers are needed, such as when generating passwords or encrypting data. In these cases, computers can use external sources of randomness, such as the movement of a mouse or the time it takes for a user to press a key, to generate truly random numbers.

Overall, it is important to remember that computers are not capable of generating truly random numbers on their own. They rely on algorithms and external sources of randomness to produce numbers that appear random.",,reddit_eli5,16523
WHY do n't cats like water / getting wet ? THANK YOU . Explain like I'm five.,"Just depends on the cat . I have 4 , some who like water , some who do n't . Biologically speaking , domestic house cats do not have waterproof oil on their fur ( nor do that have a buoyant coat or warm undercoat ) , so unlike a dog like a Labrador , the cold water actually reaches their skin , chilling them . Most cats do n't like that feeling , so they learn to avoid it . On the other hand , there are whole species of cats known for swimming readily , such as Turkish Vans and Savannahs .","Cats don't have a natural instinct to like water or getting wet because they are naturally adapted to getting their hydration from the moisture in their food. Wild cats, like lions and tigers, get most of their water from the prey they hunt and eat. Domestic cats have also learned to get their hydration from their food, rather than from drinking water.

Some cats may be more hesitant to get wet because their coats are not designed to retain water well and can become heavy and uncomfortable when wet. Additionally, cats have sensitive skin and getting wet can be uncomfortable for them.

"when you stretch thoroughly , why does your hearing momentarily cut out ? Sometimes it can just numb the hearing considerably but more often than not my hearing goes when I stretch , like the ear hole is getting covered over or something . Explain like I'm five.","This is actually fascinating process . First off , your inner ear is an air chamber filled with sensitive instruments and sealed off from the world by your ear drum . It is , however , connected through your Eustachian tubes to your sinus , allowing it to equalize with changing air pressures . When you have a cold and these tubes get blocked off , diving under water or flying in an airplane can create pressure changes that are truly painful . You need to "" pop "" your ears to make it go away , or massage the Eustachians by chewing some gum . ( They are effected by moving your jaw around ) Now what does this have to do with stretching ? When you yawn , your jaw goes way back and your Eustachian tubes open up really wide . ( They 're not normally wide open , otherwise you 'd feel it in your ears every time you swallow . ) And then you pinch them off . As you pinch them off , the continued yawning and stretching actions squeeze the tissues around your ear , and your tongue will back against your nasal passage changing the air pressure in your sinus . All of this causes flutters of pressure changes within your inner ear , as you open it , seal it off , squeeze it and release . This momentary pressure in your inner ear pushes against the ear drum and messes with your ability to pick up sound waves during the stretch . Now sometimes something really awesome happens . Your ear actually has a built - in hearing aid , and it can get a feedback loop and have to reset ! There are tiny hairs ( ? ) in your inner ear that will vibrate in response to sound , amplifying it . Now , just like when someone gets that horrible feedback squeal between a microphone and speakers , sometimes these hairs pick up a random vibration and runaway with it . You 'll actually hear a very high - pitched ringing that slowly fades away to silence , with diminished hearing ability for a few minutes until the system has reset . Stretching sometimes sets off this feedback loop of hearing - aid hairs and can cause you to lose hearing volume for a couple minutes .

Isopropyl alcohol comes in different concentrations, with 70% isopropyl alcohol being a common concentration.\n\nThe concentration of isopropyl alcohol refers to the amount of isopropyl alcohol present in the solution. For example, a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution contains 70% isopropyl alcohol and 30% water. A 99% isopropyl alcohol solution, on the other hand, contains 99% isopropyl alcohol and 1% water.\n\nIn general, higher concentrations of isopropyl alcohol are more effective at killing germs and bacteria. However, 70% isopropyl alcohol is still effective at killing germs and bacteria and is less drying to the skin than higher concentrations. This makes it a good choice for use as a disinfectant, especially for use on the skin.\n\nSo, to answer your question, 70% isopropyl alcohol is considered a better disinfectant because it is effective at killing germs and bacteria, and it is less drying to the skin than higher concentrations.",,reddit_eli5,4803
Why do n't all cars have gas doors on the same side ? I came up with a second question - thanks ! Explain like I'm five.,"I do n't know why they 're not all on the same side , but I do know that there 's usually a little arrow on the gas guage pointing to the side of the car where the gas tank is .","There is no one reason why all cars don't have the gas door on the same side. Different car manufacturers may have different design preferences or may consider factors such as the layout of the gas station, the layout of the roads in the area where the car will be sold, and the convenience for the driver when deciding where to place the gas door.

For example, some car manufacturers may place the gas door on the driver's side of the car because it is more convenient for the driver to access while they are filling up the gas tank. Other car manufacturers may place the gas door on the passenger side of the car because it is more convenient for the driver to access in countries where people drive on the opposite side of the road.

In general, the placement of the gas door is not a particularly important factor for most car buyers, and so car manufacturers have the freedom to choose where to place the gas door on their vehicles based on their own design preferences and practical considerations.",,reddit_eli5,8762
Does eating / drinking certain foods at a young age actually impact height / physical appearance later on in life ? Such as drinking milk makes you big and strong ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Being underfed certainly will stunt your growth , the average human height actually * dropped * after we became industrialized , because food was more plentiful in the normal rural life . This was reversed after a few decades as living standards improved . However , it only really matters until a certain point . Once you 've met your all your basic dietary needs , excessive amount of vitamins and minerals are just going to be wasted ( excess fat soluble vitamins will actually * poison * you because we ca n't excrete them fast ! ) and excess calories will just be stored as fat . Say you drink excessive amounts of milk - well , that 'll just decrease the fraction that we absorb from the intestines , thanks to regulation of parathyroid hormone and Vitamin D. So yes , being malnourished , especially early on , will stunt your growth , but overeating and eating 10 vitamin pills daily wo n't do anything good for you .","Eating and drinking certain foods can definitely impact your physical appearance and growth, but it's not quite as simple as saying that one specific food will make you big and strong.Your body needs a variety of nutrients to grow and develop properly, and different foods can provide these nutrients in different amounts. For example, milk is a good source of protein, which is important for building and repairing tissues in your body. It also contains calcium, which is important for strong bones. So, if you drink milk and eat a balanced diet that includes other foods that provide the nutrients your body needs, it can help you grow and develop properly.However, it's important to remember that everyone is different and may have different nutritional needs at different times in their lives. It's always a good idea to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of different foods, and to talk to a doctor or a nutritionist if you have any specific questions about your diet and your health.",,reddit_eli5,6478
how math is separate from human perception I 'm in a semi drunk debate with a few friends . I 'm trying to explain how math exists regardless of human intelligence . A priori and all that . Help ! Explain like I'm five.,"It does n't . Math is a method of modeling reality . It departs from reality in the simplest of calculations : 1 + 1=2 for example . There is no such thing as "" two "" in nature , there is just a thing and another thing . But because they both exist we can group them and call it two , and if we have another instance of that we would have a thing , another thing , another , and another ( 2 + 2=4 , 4=1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ) . Math does n't exist without human thought , but what it models persists . Not every aspect of math is guaranteed to have a real - world equivalent , but it is specifically designed to be identical to reality and they are both internally consistent so there is much overlap .","Sure! Math is a way of understanding and describing patterns and relationships in the world around us. It's based on logical rules and principles that hold true no matter what. For example, the concept of ""two"" exists whether or not anyone is around to understand it. If we have two apples, we will always have two apples, even if no one is there to count them.

Similarly, the principles of math, such as the idea that adding two and two always equals four, hold true regardless of whether or not anyone is there to understand them. These principles are often referred to as ""a priori"" because they are known independently of experience.

So, in a sense, math is separate from human perception because it exists independently of our understanding or interpretation of it. It is a universal language that helps us make sense of the world around us, and it will always be true, no matter what.",,reddit_eli5,16791
"Why do n't they land space capsules in a lake so as to not have to deal with salt water ? Salt water is hard on metal and electronics , why not just drop it in a big lake ? Like the great lakes for instance . Please explain like I'm five.","Ocean provides much better margins of error , and the navy , the folk that actually have to go pick them up , are far more suited to getting out on the open seas rather than shimmying through the canals to get up the St Lawrence and through the lakes . Also the capsule , ideally , is only facing salt water on the exterior . That 's the heat shield and vacuum shield , it 's dealt with far worse .","Landing a spacecraft in a lake would not be a safe or practical way to return to Earth. Here are a few reasons why: 
1. Density: Water is much denser than air, so when a spacecraft falls into it from a high altitude, it will experience much more resistance and deceleration. This could cause the spacecraft to break apart or sustain serious damage upon impact. 
2. Depth: Lakes are typically not very deep, so if a spacecraft were to land in one, it would have to do so at a very low altitude. This would not give the spacecraft enough time to slow down and make a safe landing. 
3. Control: When a spacecraft returns to Earth, it needs to be able to control its descent and land in a specific location. This is not possible when landing in a lake, as the spacecraft would be at the mercy of the wind and currents. 
4. Recovery: Finally, it would be very difficult to recover a spacecraft that has landed in a lake. Specialized equipment would be needed to lift it out of the water, which could be time-consuming and costly. 
In summary, landing a spacecraft in a lake is not a safe or practical option. Instead, spacecraft are designed to land on solid ground, where they can touch down at a controlled speed and be easily recovered.",,reddit_eli5,91
How a nation would establish a national currency if there was none in place before . Not in the 21st century but in the past . Explain like I'm five.,"The government guarenteed for it 's value in some way , so in case people stopped wanting to use it they could trade it in to the governenment for something of value .","Establishing a national currency is a way for a country to have its own money that is used within its borders. Here are the steps a country might take to establish a national currency:

Decide on the design of the currency: This might include what the coins and bills will look like and what they will be made of.

Set the value of the currency: The government will need to decide how much each coin or bill is worth in relation to other currencies and to goods and services within the country.

Produce the currency: Once the design and value of the currency have been decided, the government will need to actually produce the coins and bills. This might involve hiring a company to print the currency or minting the coins.

Distribute the currency: The government will need to get the new currency into the hands of people and businesses so it can be used. This might involve banks, money changers, or other financial institutions.

Promote the use of the currency: The government will need to encourage people and businesses to use the new currency in place of any other money that might be in circulation. This might involve making it illegal to use other currencies or offering incentives for using the new currency.

Overall, establishing a national currency is a complex process that requires careful planning and coordination. It can help a country have more control over its economy and make it easier for people and businesses to buy and sell goods and services within its borders.",,reddit_eli5,8817
Why are the Republicans are so anti Chuck Hagel ? Thanks in advance Explain like I'm five.,"Two reasons . The Jewish lobby is very powerful and many think that they do n't like him because he pointed this out . The real reason the Jewish lobby does n't like chuck is because of his stance on Israel . They do not want a secretary of defense who is any but 100 percent pro Israel . So the Jews are lobbying against him . Reason number two is that there are some pretty wack job radical Christians in the Republican Party . In the bible it says that Israel must be a country in order for Jesus to return . So you pair a group of rich Jews and powerful wacko Christians who will do anything to ensure Israel 's existence , and you get one of the most powerful political forces in American politics . If your interested google Christian Zionism . Also google modern history of Israel . They are both good reads .","It's not accurate to say that all Republicans are ""anti"" Chuck Hagel, but some Republicans did express opposition to Hagel when he was nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as the United States Secretary of Defense in 2013. There were a number of reasons for this opposition.

One reason was that some Republicans disagreed with Hagel's views on foreign policy and national security issues. Hagel, a Vietnam War veteran and former senator from Nebraska, had a reputation as a pragmatist and a critic of military intervention. Some Republicans felt that his views were too dovish and that he would not be aggressive enough in defending American interests.

Another reason for Republican opposition to Hagel was his past statements on Israel and the Middle East. Some Republicans felt that Hagel was not supportive enough of Israel and that he had made statements that were critical of the country.

Finally, some Republicans may have opposed Hagel's nomination for political reasons, such as wanting to block or oppose President Obama's choices for key positions in his administration.

Overall, the opposition to Chuck Hagel's nomination was complex and multifaceted, and it was not necessarily based on a single issue or ideology.",,reddit_eli5,16453
"Why is your wrist associated with a fast metabolism ? If the perimeter formed between your middle finger and the thumb , which is created around your wrist and the fingers meet each other . Why does that mean you have a fast metabolism ? Please explain like I'm five.","My unscientific guess would be that it is just a correlation . Being able to wrap your thumb and middle finger around your wrist would suggest a lower level of body fat and/or fat around your wrist . Lower levels of body fat are generally caused by a faster metabolism , whether it be through genetics or diet / exercise .","There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that the size of a person's wrist is related to their metabolism. The size of a person's wrist is determined by their bone structure, which is largely inherited from their parents. A person's metabolism, on the other hand, refers to the process by which their body converts food into energy. Factors that can affect a person's metabolism include their age, gender, weight, muscle mass, and physical activity level. Some people may have a naturally faster metabolism, which means that their body is more efficient at converting food into energy, but this has nothing to do with the size of their wrist.",,reddit_eli5,6490
"If the Nazis were ultranationalists in favour of tradition , why did n't they reinstate the German monarchy ? Seems like . Natural thing to do for party so supportive of nationalistic symbols and tradition . Please explain like I'm five.","The German Emperors were n't really a long - established tradition like other monarchies . They were the Kings of Prussia , the last three of whom adopted the title of German Emperor . Also it 's likely that Hitler partly blamed Wilhelm II for Germany 's defeat in the First World War , so bringing in his grandson to restore the monarchy would n't appeal .","The Nazi Party, which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945, was indeed an ultranationalist party that sought to promote the interests of the German nation and people. However, the party was also authoritarian and dictatorial, and it did not believe in allowing for the existence of any power centers outside of its own control. 
The German monarchy, which had been abolished in 1918 at the end of World War I, represented a potential rival power center that could potentially challenge the authority of the Nazi Party. Therefore, the Nazi leadership decided not to reinstate the monarchy, even though it may have seemed like a natural thing to do given the party's emphasis on tradition and national symbols. 
Instead, the Nazi Party established itself as the supreme authority in Germany, and it sought to eliminate any potential rivals or opposition to its rule. This included suppressing and eliminating political parties, organizations, and individuals who opposed the party's goals or policies.",,reddit_eli5,342
"Why would the U.S. want to spy on Germany ? Regardless of whether the claims are true or not , I 'm wondering why the U.S. would need to spy on an ally country . Explain like I'm five.","First , you need to understand three things . 1 ) Allies still compete on the global stage . They compete for resources globally , they negotiate treaties in an adversarial manner ( that 's how negotiations work ) and alliances wavier and change . Allies also have competing alliances . Germany v. North Korea ? Sure . Germany v. Spain ? Who knows if they 'll pick the US alliance or the Spanish alliance ? 2 ) The duty of an intelligence agency is to provide the best , most complete and most accurate information possible to policy - makers so that they can make the best choices . 3 ) Governments do n't always say what they mean . Sometimes they mislead to get better negotiations . Often times they 'll say something to their domestic audience that 's completely different from what they 'll say to their international audience ( and often neither will be the true , more secret position of the government ) . How do you know which is the true position when the government is sending different messages to different groups ? You spy ! So , at a very basic level spying on your allies helps you understand what they really mean and believe versus what they 're saying . Knowing how the government actually feels , versus how they say they feel publicly helps you know how to best write and negotiate treaties . ( For example : Merkel is publicly outraged , but she 's really just faking outrage to play well domestically because her people are outraged ( and to score points in an upcoming trade negotiation with the US ) . The German government does n't really give a fuck about our spying because they understand its part of the game and do the same thing with their BND . If we took what Merkel was saying at face value , we would panic . However , our intel reveals that the panic is really manufactured from a government perspective . ) At a more advanced level , allies are not always allies . Sure , Germany will probably work with us against North Korea . But , if we 're in trilateral negotiations with France and Germany , then knowing what 's going on between France and Germany will help the US position itself to get the best deal it can . ( Similarly , Germany will spy on France and the US and France will spy on Germany in the US ) As an addendum : Intelligence services also provide for back - channel communication between governments . Intelligence services can communicate between each other and speak more frankly than through heavily political channels with embassies and heads of state .","There could be a variety of reasons why a country might engage in spying on another country, even if they are allies. One reason could be to gather information about the military capabilities or political plans of the other country. Another reason could be to gather information about potential threats to the country's own national security. Additionally, a country might engage in spying to gain an economic advantage, such as by gathering information about the other country's trade secrets or business plans. It's important to note that these are just a few examples and that the specific reasons for any particular instance of spying can vary widely. It's also important to note that engaging in spying is generally considered to be a normal part of international relations, and it is not uncommon for countries to engage in espionage activities against one another.",,reddit_eli5,8856

"How do films played at a frame rate higher than intended remain synced with the audio ? Say a movie recorded at 24 fps is played back at 60fps , either analog or through digital streaming , how does the sound keep up without being distorted ? Explain like I'm five. ","How does it sync normally ? You stream a video service , which contains both video and audio . The two are kept completely separate with only one thing to share : A time stamp . So a video system has a reference clock , and each picture and audio ' frame ' have something called a display time stamp . So digital audio is not embedded inside the digital video frames . They are running alongside with a time stamp that the player can use to sync the video up against the audio . It just receives both , waits until the display time and show the image and play the sound . If you are inserting more video frames , it does n't really matter , as you have to give them new time stamps that fit in between where the existing video frames were . So the video keeps the same time stamps , it just has more of them . And the audio never even realises that something is going on .","When a movie is played back at a higher frame rate than it was recorded, the extra frames are typically created by duplicating some of the original frames. So for example, if a movie was recorded at 24 frames per second and is played back at 60 frames per second, each original frame would be shown on screen for a shorter period of time, and then repeated two or three more times before the next original frame is shown.\n\nThe audio track of the movie is not affected by this process, so it will still be played back at the same rate it was recorded. This means that the audio and the video will be slightly out of sync, with the audio running slightly ahead of the video.\n\nTo fix this, the movie's audio track can be sped up slightly, so that it matches the faster frame rate of the video. This will cause the audio to sound slightly higher pitched, but it will still be in sync with the video. Alternatively, the video can be slowed down slightly, so that it matches the audio. This will cause the video to appear slightly slower, but the audio and video will be in sync.\n\nOverall, the process of keeping the audio and video in sync when playing a movie at a higher frame rate involves making slight adjustments to either the audio or the video, so that they both match the desired frame rate.",,reddit_eli5,4177

They are both predicted by the theory of general relativity, which explains how gravity works.

A black hole is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape from it, not even light. Black holes are formed when a star collapses at the end of its life and becomes very dense. There are three main types of black holes: small ones called ""stellar"" black holes, medium-sized ones called ""intermediate"" black holes, and supermassive black holes that can be millions or billions of times more massive than the sun.

A white hole is the opposite of a black hole. It is a region of space where nothing can enter, but everything can escape. In other words, it is the ""exit"" of a black hole. White holes are purely theoretical and have never been observed. They are not expected to exist in the real universe because they violate the laws of thermodynamics, which are basic laws that govern how energy and matter behave.

The theoretical value of black holes to mankind is that they can help us understand the laws of physics and the nature of the universe. Black holes are very mysterious objects and scientists are still trying to understand how they work and what they can tell us about the universe. Some scientists believe that black holes could be portals to other parts of the universe or even other dimensions.

The reason for this is that blankets serve a few different purposes that can make us feel more comfortable and help us sleep better. One reason people use blankets when it's hot is because they can help regulate our body temperature. Even though it may be hot outside, the air inside your bedroom may not be as warm, which can make you feel cold. A blanket can help keep you warm and comfortable by trapping your body heat and keeping it close to you. Another reason people use blankets is for comfort. Wrapping yourself in a cozy blanket can make you feel more secure and relaxed, which can help you fall asleep more easily. Finally, some people use blankets for the simple reason that they've always used them and have become accustomed to having one. It may just be a habit or part of their bedtime routine that helps them feel more at ease and ready for sleep. In short, there are many reasons why people use blankets, even when it's hot outside.

Think of them like the skeleton inside your body - they help keep everything in its place and give the wires the strength and support they need to do their job.\n\nInside a cable, the wires are usually arranged in a specific pattern and twisted together.

Instead, tea leaves are usually dried and then brewed to make a hot beverage called tea. To make tea, the dried tea leaves are steeped in hot water to extract their flavor and aromas. The resulting liquid is then strained and served. 
Eating tea leaves may not be harmful to your health, but they are not usually considered a food and are not a good source of nutrients. Additionally, some types of tea leaves may contain compounds that can cause digestive issues if consumed in large amounts. 
So while it is technically possible to eat tea leaves, it is not a common practice and is not generally recommended. It is much more enjoyable to enjoy tea leaves as a hot, flavorful beverage.",,reddit_eli5,883
Why can does bark what seems like forever but people can only scream for a hour or two ? I mean some dogs wo n't shut up and constantly yap . Please explain like I'm five.,"Because don'ts ca nt bark like never , so people seems like screaming less for some time .","Dogs bark for a variety of reasons, such as to alert their owners of something, to communicate with other dogs, or to express excitement or frustration. Some dogs are more prone to barking than others, and some breeds are known for being more vocal than others. 
People can only scream for a short period of time because our bodies are not built to handle the strain of screaming for long periods of time. Screaming uses a lot of energy and can be very tiring, which is why people can only do it for a short period of time before they need to rest. 
Dogs, on the other hand, are built differently and are able to bark for longer periods of time without getting as tired. Dogs also have different vocal cords than humans, which may make it easier for them to bark for longer periods of time without damaging their vocal cords.",,reddit_eli5,16
"How hydropower does n't violate the law of conservation of energy . To clarify a little . If I have two identical waterfalls and I put a wheel in one of them to generate electricity , what does that waterfall lose over the other one ? Explain like I'm five. ","The hydropower waterfall 's water will hit the ground with less force ( having been decelerated by the generator ) , so you might have different ( lower energy ) kinds of river formations from the hydropower waterfall . I have no idea what a slower river looks like vs a faster one , but that would be the answer .","Hydropower doesn't violate the law of conservation of energy because it converts one form of energy into another. When water falls from a height, it has gravitational potential energy. As it falls, this energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy of movement.\n\nWhen you put a wheel in a waterfall to generate electricity, the kinetic energy of the falling water is used to turn the wheel. This energy is then converted into electrical energy, which can be used to power homes and businesses.\n\nThe waterfall doesn't lose any energy in this process. Instead, the energy is simply changed from one form (kinetic energy) into another form (electrical energy). The total amount of energy remains the same, it is just being converted from one form to another.\n\nSo, if you have two identical waterfalls and you put a wheel in one of them to generate electricity, both waterfalls will have the same amount of energy. The difference is that the waterfall with the wheel will be using some of its energy to turn the wheel and create electricity, while the other waterfall will not be doing this.",,reddit_eli5,4258
How to ' hot fixes ' in video games work ? How can developers edit code without causing un update ? Explain like I'm five. ,"There are two possibilities : 1 . The hotfix is applied to the server - side code which does not require a client - side update ( on the user end ) . It 's not the case that developers can choose whether a hotfix is applied on the server - side or client - side code — rather it 's based on where the bug , error , or vulnerability that needs to be corrected exists . 2 . The hotfix is silently downloaded and installed automatically when the user opens the game without the end user 's knowledge . This is how many modern software applications — especially web browsers — keep users up to date with the latest hotfixes / patches .","Hot fixes in video games work by allowing developers to make small changes or fixes to a game without the need to release a full update. This is often done to fix bugs or other issues that have been discovered after the game has been released.\n\nTo make a hot fix, the developers will identify the specific code that needs to be changed and then write new code to fix the problem. This new code is then tested to make sure it works as intended and does not cause any additional issues.\n\nOnce the hot fix is ready, it is then sent to the servers that host the game. These servers will then update the game with the new code, which will be downloaded by players the next time they launch the game.\n\nOverall, hot fixes allow developers to quickly and easily fix problems in their games without the need to release a full update.

How can someone be force - fed ? In relation to recent hunger strikes in places like Guantanamo . Explain like I'm five.,"There 's to main ways , either tie them down , stick a tube down their through , and pour mushed up food down it , or tie them down , and stick an IV in their arm . This is speculation , but I 'm pretty sure the only reason they use feeding tubes anymore is because its a pretty effective way of ending a hunger strike . Its pretty much torture but its easily "" justified "" because it is also a lifesaving treatment .","Force-feeding is a medical procedure that is used to give food or fluids to a person who is unable to eat or drink on their own. It is usually done through a tube that is inserted through the person's nose and down into their stomach. The tube is attached to a bag of food or fluids, and the person is fed through the tube.

Force-feeding is often used in situations where a person is on a hunger strike and refuses to eat or drink. Hunger strikes are a way for people to protest or make a statement by refusing to eat or drink. In places like Guantanamo, some prisoners have gone on hunger strikes to protest their detention or treatment. In these cases, the prison or medical staff may decide to force-feed the person to keep them from becoming dangerously malnourished or dehydrated.

Force-feeding can be a controversial practice, as it involves physically forcing food or fluids into a person's body against their will. Some people believe that it is a form of abuse and that it is not ethical to force-feed someone who is protesting in this way. Others argue that it is necessary to prevent serious harm or death from malnutrition or dehydration.",,reddit_eli5,8941

With Mt. Everest growing at a rate of two inches per year would the peak eventually reach space ? What are the limits on something like this ? Please explain like I'm five.,"It would collapse under its own weight before it could reach that height . The limiting factors are the strength of the material comprising the mountain to resist deformation , versus the force gravity exerts on the mass of the mountain . As it grows , the weight of the mountain eventually deforms the material underneath it . This is essentially why large bodies like planets are spheres , instead of wacky shapes extending into space .","Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, with a peak that reaches an elevation of about 29,029 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level. It is not actually growing in height, but rather, it is being uplifted by the movement of the Earth's crust. This process is called tectonic uplift, and it occurs when the Earth's plates collide and push against each other. 
As for whether the peak of Mount Everest could eventually reach space, the answer is no. The Earth's atmosphere extends about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface of the Earth, and the peak of Mount Everest is much shorter than that. Even if Mount Everest were to continue to be uplifted at a rate of two inches per year, it would take many thousands of years for it to reach the edge of the atmosphere. 
There are also other factors that limit the height that a mountain can reach. For example, the weight of the mountain itself can cause it to sink down into the Earth's crust. Additionally, erosion caused by wind and water can gradually wear away at the mountain, causing it to become shorter over time. 
So, to sum it up, Mount Everest is not going to grow tall enough to reach space. It is being uplifted by the movement of the Earth's plates, but there are other factors that limit its height and prevent it from growing indefinitely.",,reddit_eli5,316

Why do cameras take blurry photos ? Does it have to do with the shutter time ? Why do cameras need a shutter time in the first place ? Edit : Thanks guys ! Especially /u / Teotwawki69 for the aperture / exposure time examples Explain like I'm five.,"Yes , it does have to do with the shutter speed . Shutter speed is the amount of time the shutter is open which allows light to come in contact with the image sensor ( or film ) . An image becomes blurry when the shutter is open long enough that the object and/or the camera move . A short shutter speed is necessary to get non - blurry action shots ( like sports photos ) . The trade of is that when the shutter is only for a short amount of time only a minimal amount of light comes in contact with the image sensor so you need to have good lighting . Since the vast majority of cameras automatically choose shutter speed , ISO , and other settings you will notice that taking pictures at night often leads to blurry pictures . This is because the camera knows that it will need to leave the shutter open longer to allow more light in and this means you are much more likely to move the camera while the shutter is open , causing a blur . Generally , you will need a tripod for any shutter speeds slower than 1/60th of a second .","Cameras take blurry photos for a variety of reasons. One reason is that the camera is not held steady enough while the picture is being taken. This can happen if the camera is hand-held and the person taking the picture is not holding it steady enough, or if the camera is resting on a surface that is not stable.

Shutter speed is the length of time that the camera's shutter is open to allow light to reach the camera's sensor. Aperture is the size of the opening in the lens that allows light to pass through to the camera's sensor. The combination of the two controls the amount of light that enters the camera and the depth of field (the area in focus) in the final photograph.

Shutter speed and aperture are important because they allow the photographer to control the amount of light that enters the camera and to freeze or blur motion in the photograph. For example, if you want to take a picture of a moving object and you want the object to appear sharp and in focus, you would need to use a fast shutter speed. This would allow the camera to quickly ""freeze"" the motion of the object and prevent it from appearing blurry. On the other hand, if you want to intentionally blur the motion of the object, you would use a slower shutter speed.

I hope this helps to explain why cameras take blurry photos and why shutter speed and aperture are important in photography. Let me know if you have any other questions.",,reddit_eli5,9309

Please explain like I'm five.",Only as a child ? I 'm in my 40 's and I can still hear it .,"That high-pitched sound that you could hear when you were a child is called ""white noise."" White noise is a type of noise that contains all frequencies of sound that the human ear can hear, at equal intensity. It's called ""white"" noise because it is similar to white light, which is made up of all the colors of the spectrum mixed together. 
Sometimes, electronic devices like TVs, radios, and computers make white noise as a side effect of how they work. The white noise is usually at such a high frequency that adults can't hear it, but children and young adults often can because their hearing is more sensitive. 
White noise can be annoying, especially if it's very loud or if you hear it for a long time. But it is not harmful to your hearing or your health. If you find the white noise to be bothersome, you can try moving the device that is making the noise farther away from you, or turning it off if you don't need it.",,reddit_eli5,1398
How are allergies able to be acquired as people get older ? I 've have friends who have just started to be allergic to some foods that they were n't allergic to before . How does this happen ? Explain like I'm five. ,"Allergies are caused by our immune system mistaking food or innocuous particles like pollen , for invading pathogens . How does this happen ? Well , all cells and viruses have chemical markers on their surfaces call Antigens . Our own cells can recognize each other by reading their antigens , and our immune cells are the same . When an immune cell encounters another object , it will read its antigens , and if it does n't recognize them as friendly , it will attempt to destroy the object . The immune system is also adaptable , and it has a memory . When we get chicken pox for example , after defeating it , the system will keep a record of the chicken pox antigens , so when the disease is encountered later on in life , our immune system already knows how to fight it . Things that cause allergies also have antigens , and sometimes our immune system will encounter an antigen on some food , and mistakenly think its an invading pathogen . The immune system then mobilizes , attacks the foodstuff , and then keeps a record of its antigens . When the food is next encountered , the immune system will recognize it , and unleash its power to attack the food . The side effects of this battle is what we know as an allergy . Because our immune system can make a mistake at any point in our life , we always retain the chances of developing new allergies .","Allergies occur when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies a normally harmless substance as a harmful invader. When this happens, the body mounts an immune response to the substance, which can cause symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and difficulty breathing.\n\nPeople can develop allergies at any age, and it is not uncommon for people to develop allergies to substances they were not previously allergic to. This can happen because the body's immune system changes over time, and a person may become more sensitive to certain substances as they age.\n\nIt is also possible for a person to develop an allergy to a substance they have been exposed to for the first time. For example, if someone has never eaten peanuts before, and they eat peanuts for the first time as an adult, they may develop an allergy to peanuts.\n\nIn summary, allergies can develop at any age, and they can be caused by either a change in the body's immune system or by exposure to a new substance.",,reddit_eli5,4904

As a consultant to a doctor , they can do deep thinking and reasoning about scheduling your medication and making you well , and this is far more than what a computer can do , if medication dispensing was automated ( which is mostly is for the pharmacist , because they 're more valuable for their ability to reason than their ability to mechanically lookup a drug conflict ) . What sucks is the division of intrest through the pharmacy . You see , the pharmacy exists so that doctors are inclined to perscribe the appropriate medication to suit your needs , as opposed to what would make them the most money if they sold you medications directly . It is in this separation of interest that we interact with pharmacists and their technicians in what I argue is less valuable , because of my trust and relationship with my doctor , who understands my condition and diagnosis .","A pharmacist is a healthcare professional who is trained to dispense medications to patients.

To dispense the medication, the pharmacist may do one of several things. If the medication is in a bottle, they may simply count out the required number of pills and put them in a bag for you. If the medication needs to be prepared in some other way, such as mixing powders together or preparing a liquid solution, the pharmacist will do this in a sterile environment to ensure that the medication is safe to take.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) How does it work ? Most other explanations I found were n't too ' explanatory ' ... Pls halp Please explain like I'm five.,"Consider that the majority of your body is composed of water . MRIs rely on that fact . Now imagine an MRI machine as a giant magnet with an image capture device . Once you are placed inside of it , the magnet is turned on . This sends a bunch of energy into the water , and causes all of the water molecules in your body to rotate out of whatever position they were in and change into another orientation . Then the magnet is turned off . Now all of the water reverts to its original position and releases that energy placed into it by the magnet . Now the MRI machine absorbs that released energy into an image capture device and forms a picture based on the location of that water . The details of the image made of your body are produced because the water in certain tissues releases its energy at different speeds . Edit : MRIs are extremely safe as long as there is no metal in the room , which will be attracted to the powerful magnet . Also , unlike x - rays and cat scans , they do not increase your risk of cancer because they do not use ionizing radiation . Edit 2 : This is a very ELI5 explanation -- there are more complete ones elsewhere in this thread .","Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI, is a medical imaging technique that uses a large magnet and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It's used to help doctors diagnose and treat a variety of medical conditions.Here's how it works:You lie on a table that slides into a long, narrow tube-like machine.The machine sends radio waves into your body. These waves are absorbed by the water in your cells, causing the atoms inside to vibrate.As the atoms vibrate, they produce a tiny pulse of energy.The machine has a magnet inside it that can detect this pulse of energy. It sends a signal back to a computer, which uses the information to create an image of the inside of your body.The computer creates a detailed picture of the inside of your body by combining information from many different pulses of energy.MRI is a safe and painless way to create detailed images of the inside of your body.

Why was the Hammer and Anvil tactic developed by Alexander The Great so effective ? How was it able to completely destroy the Persian army in the Battle of Issus when Alexander 's forces were completely outnumbered 5 to 1 ? Explain like I'm five.,"In regards to the Battle of Issus specifically , there 's a rather easy answer to why it was so effective . By the time Alexander led his Calvary ( the hammer ) into the back of the Persian lines , he had already sent the opposing commander Darius fleeing for his life . He was actually trying to chase him down , when he saw his center was in trouble , wheeled his Calvary back towards the battle , and hit the Persian center from the rear . Also , when he crashed into the Persian center , he was actually attacking a majority of the Greek Mercenaries who had been placed in the center before battle commenced , not just the Persian infantry . Once the mercenaries ( and Persians ) realized that Darius was fleeing and the battle was lost , they all began to retreat themselves . Also of note is that historians have revised numbers showing that the Persians had a 2.5 to 1 advantage . Still significant , but not as great as originally thought . TL;DR version : It worked because Darius had already fled the field , and the Persians and mercenaries realized this about the same time that Alexander unexpectedly hit them in the rear with his Calvary .","The Hammer and Anvil tactic is a military strategy in which one force (the hammer) attacks an enemy head-on, while another force (the anvil) waits in a position to block the enemy's retreat or escape. This can be very effective because it traps the enemy in between the two forces, making it difficult for them to escape or maneuver.

Alexander the Great was a skilled military commander who was famous for his ability to outmaneuver and defeat larger enemy forces. In the Battle of Issus, he used the Hammer and Anvil tactic to great effect by positioning his own forces to block the Persian army's retreat. This meant that the Persians were unable to escape or maneuver, and they were eventually defeated by Alexander's forces.

It's also worth noting that while the Persians may have been outnumbered 5 to 1 in the Battle of Issus, Alexander's forces were well-trained and disciplined, while the Persians were less cohesive and less well-organized. This may have also contributed to Alexander's victory in the battle.",,reddit_eli5,8165

Increasing that pool of investors is often a useful thing .","Going public means that a company becomes a publicly traded company and starts selling shares of its stock to the public. There are a few reasons why a company might choose to go public: To raise money: Going public can be a way for a company to raise a lot of money quickly. When a company goes public, it sells shares of its stock to investors. The company can use the money it raises from the sale of these shares to fund its operations, pay off debt, or invest in new projects. To increase visibility: Being a publicly traded company can increase a company's visibility and reputation. This can be especially important for smaller companies that are trying to gain recognition in their industry. To give shareholders a way to sell their shares: When a company is privately held, it can be difficult for shareholders to sell their shares. Going public gives shareholders a way to sell their shares on the stock market, which can be attractive to some shareholders who want to cash in their investment. To give employees a way to sell their shares: Some companies offer stock options to their employees as a form of compensation. Going public gives these employees a way to sell their shares and potentially make a profit.

Why liking Dane Cook is a bad thing I always see comedians and tv shows riping on Dane Cook and as I do nt live in the USA i was wondering why ? Explain like I'm five.,You can like whatever you want to like .,"There are a few reasons why some people might not like Dane Cook or think he is not a good comedian. One reason is that some people think his jokes are not funny or that he relies too much on crude or offensive humor. Another reason is that some people have accused him of stealing jokes from other comedians, which is considered unethical in the comedy industry. It's important to remember that different people have different tastes in comedy, and what one person finds funny might not be the same as what someone else finds funny. It's also important to remember that it's okay to have different opinions and to respect the opinions of others, even if you don't agree with them.",,reddit_eli5,9986
How do nations such as Finland afford to supply university education for free ? Are the taxes significantly higher ? Or do they cut funding elsewhere ? I have searched this but have n't found too much . Please explain like I'm five.,"Some European countries are starting to twig to the idea of "" the public good , "" and beginning to realize what was obvious to some all along : it benefits society in general . Providing universal tax - supported university education provides * enormous * benefits to society , and at both ends of the spectrum : it reduces crime and it increases innovation and entrepreneurship . Such things are difficult to sum up in a neat little balance sheet , but it 's entirely reasonable to conclude that such plans return more to society than they cost in taxes . Then you have places like the US , where a lot of people in wealth and power have mistaken the puerile , greedy rantings of Ayn Rand novels for a viable social policy , and actually work to * demolish * the notion of the public good . It 's just as well , since the US also spends so much on ( mostly worthless ) war toys that we ca n't even consider spending more money on improving the society .","Finland is able to provide free university education to its citizens because the government has made it a priority and has allocated sufficient funding to cover the costs. In order to fund this and other public services, Finland has relatively high taxes compared to some other countries. However, the Finnish government believes that providing free education and other public services is worth the cost because it helps to create a more educated and skilled workforce, which can lead to economic growth and a better quality of life for everyone in the long run. So, in a way, the Finnish government is investing in its citizens by providing them with free education. This investment is paid for through taxes, which are collected from people and businesses in Finland. By collecting these taxes, the government is able to fund the services and programs that it thinks are important for the country, such as education, healthcare, and social services. It's also important to note that free university education is just one aspect of the Finnish education system, which is consistently ranked as one of the best in the world. In Finland, education is highly valued and is seen as a right for all citizens, not just a privilege for those who can afford it. This commitment to education is reflected in the country's investment in its education system, which includes not just universities but also schools, teacher training, and other programs.",,reddit_eli5,14454

The color of your hair is determined by a pigment called melanin. Your body produces two types of melanin: eumelanin, which gives hair a brown or black color, and pheomelanin, which gives hair a red or blond color. People with tricolor hair have hair follicles that produce different amounts of these two pigments, which can result in different colors of hair on different parts of the body.

How does a ranked voting system work ? I keep hearing that it is better the USA 's current system of voting but how so ? And how would it help eliminate the 2 party system ? Please explain like I'm five.,"It depends on the system . Some use an instant runoff , where if nobody has a majority , the candidate with the most number of first place votes is eliminated , and those ballots are reallocated according to their second places votes . The process is completed until someone has a majority . It would help minor parties because the major parties spend a lot of time campaigning against the other party , and telling people that if they do n't vote for their guy , it 's like voting for the other guy . Let 's take a look at this upcoming election . Trump , Clinton and Johnson will be on the ballot in every state . So , maybe you do n't like Clinton , but you really , really do n't like Trump . You might be motivated to vote for Johnson , but you do n't want to risk Trump winning . So , you vote for Clinton . The third party gets marginalized because of this . If you get to rank the ballots , you can safely vote for the candidate that most closely matches your views . In the above scenario , you could rank Johnson first , and Clinton second . Then , even if ( well , when ) Johnson comes in third , the votes are n't wasted -- they all get reallocated to the second choice . This plan is good for third parties , but bad for the two dominant parties , because they run the risk of one of them coming in * third * when they ca n't scare voters into not voting for a third party .","A ranked voting system is a way of casting and counting votes in an election where voters are able to rank the candidates in order of preference. Instead of just choosing one candidate, voters can indicate their top choice, second choice, third choice, and so on.In a ranked voting system, if a candidate wins a majority of first-choice votes, they are declared the winner just like in a normal election. If no candidate wins a majority of first-choice votes, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to the voters' next choice. This process is repeated until one candidate has a majority of votes and is declared the winner.One advantage of ranked voting is that it can help ensure that the winner of an election has the support of a majority of voters, rather than just a plurality of voters. In a normal election, it is possible for a candidate to win with less than 50% of the vote if there are more than two candidates running. In a ranked voting system, this is less likely to happen because the votes of the least popular candidate can be redistributed to the voters' next choice.As for how a ranked voting system could help eliminate the two-party system, it's important to note that ranked voting is just one of many potential reforms that could help encourage more political diversity. However, ranked voting could potentially help by making it easier for third-party candidates or independent candidates to win elections. Since voters are able to rank multiple candidates in order of preference, they can choose to support a third-party candidate as their first choice while still expressing a preference for one of the major party candidates as their second choice. This could make it more likely that a third-party candidate could win an election, or at least have a stronger influence on the outcome.",,reddit_eli5,7785

On the other hand, TV shows are typically watched on a smaller screen, such as a TV or computer monitor, and they are often watched in a person's home.

In sparse coding, a dataset is represented as a linear combination of a fixed set of basis functions, with the coefficients of the combination being the representation of the data. The goal is to find a set of basis functions that can represent the data with as few coefficients as possible, while still preserving the important features of the data. This results in a sparse representation of the data, where most of the coefficients are zero or close to zero.

"Please explain what is ""Imperfect information""","In economics, perfect information (sometimes referred to as ""no hidden information"") is a feature of perfect competition. With perfect information in a market, all consumers and producers have complete and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices, their own utility, and own cost functions.
In game theory, a sequential game has perfect information if each player, when making any decision, is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred, including the ""initialization event"" of the game (e.g. the starting hands of each player in a card game).
Perfect information is importantly different from complete information, which implies common knowledge of each player's utility functions, payoffs, strategies and ""types"". A game with perfect information may or may not have complete information.
Games where some aspect of play is hidden from opponents - such as the cards in poker and bridge - are examples of games with imperfect information.","Imperfect information refers to a situation in which one or more players in a game or decision-making process do not have complete information about the options available to them or the consequences of their actions. In other words, the players do not have a complete understanding of the situation and must make decisions based on incomplete or limited information.



This can occur in various settings, such as in strategic games, economics, and even in everyday life. For example, in a game of poker, players do not know what cards the other players have and must make decisions based on the cards they can see and the actions of the other players. In the stock market, investors do not have complete information about the future performance of a company and must make investment decisions based on incomplete data. In everyday life, we often have to make decisions without having complete information about all of the potential outcomes or the preferences of the other people involved.



Imperfect information can lead to uncertainty and complexity in decision-making processes and can have significant impacts on the outcomes of games and real-world situations.

"Please explain what is ""Garry Kasparov""","Garry Kimovich Kasparov[a] (born 13 April 1963) is a Russian chess grandmaster, former World Chess Champion, writer, political activist and commentator. His peak rating of 2851, achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. From 1984 until his retirement in 2005, Kasparov was ranked world No. 1 for a record 255 months overall for his career, the most in history. Kasparov also holds records for the most consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11).
Kasparov became the youngest ever undisputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at age 22 by defeating then-champion Anatoly Karpov. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when a dispute with FIDE led him to set up a rival organization, the Professional Chess Association. In 1997 he became the first world champion to lose a match to a computer under standard time controls when he lost to the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a highly publicized match. He continued to hold the ""Classical"" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Despite losing the title, he continued winning tournaments and was the world's highest-rated player when he retired from professional chess in 2005.
Since retiring, he devoted his time to politics and writing. He formed the United Civil Front movement and joined as a member of The Other Russia, a coalition opposing the administration and policies of Vladimir Putin. In 2008, he announced an intention to run as a candidate in that year's Russian presidential race, but after encountering logistical problems in his campaign, for which he blamed ""official obstruction"", he withdrew. In the wake of the Russian mass protests that began in 2011, he announced in 2013 that he had left Russia for the immediate future out of fear of persecution. Following his flight from Russia, he had lived in New York City with his family.[10] In 2014, he obtained Croatian citizenship, and has maintained a residence in Podstrana near Split.[11][12][13]
Kasparov is currently chairman of the Human Rights Foundation and chairs its International Council. In 2017, he founded the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), an American political organization promoting and defending liberal democracy in the U.S. and abroad. He serves as chairman of the group.

Biological organization spans several scales and are determined based different structures depending on what the system is. Examples of biological systems at the macro scale are populations of organisms. On the organ and tissue scale in mammals and other animals, examples include the circulatory system, the respiratory system, and the nervous system. On the micro to the nanoscopic scale, examples of biological systems are cells, organelles, macromolecular complexes and regulatory pathways. A biological system is not to be confused with a living system, such as a living organism.","A biological system is a group of interconnected living organisms or their components that work together to perform a specific function or set of functions. Biological systems can range in size and complexity, from a single cell to a complex organism like a human.



Some examples of biological systems include:



The circulatory system, which transports oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells and removes waste products from the body.



The digestive system, which breaks down food and absorbs nutrients from the diet.



The nervous system, which coordinates and controls the body's responses to internal and external stimuli.



The respiratory system, which helps to oxygenate the blood and remove carbon dioxide.



The endocrine system, which produces hormones that regulate various functions in the body.



Biological systems often rely on feedback mechanisms to maintain homeostasis, or a stable internal environment. For example, the body's temperature is regulated by the endocrine system, which produces hormones that help to keep the body's temperature within a narrow range. When the body gets too hot, the sweat glands produce sweat, which helps to cool the body by evaporation. When the body gets too cold, the muscles produce heat to warm it up.

No technique is a complete solution to the spam problem, and each has trade-offs between incorrectly rejecting legitimate email (false positives) as opposed to not rejecting all spam email (false negatives) – and the associated costs in time, effort, and cost of wrongfully obstructing good mail.
Anti-spam techniques can be broken into four broad categories: those that require actions by individuals, those that can be automated by email administrators, those that can be automated by email senders and those employed by researchers and law enforcement officials.","Spam filtering is the process of identifying and removing unsolicited and unwanted emails from a user's email inbox. Spam emails, also known as junk mail, are typically sent in large quantities by advertisers and marketers for the purpose of promoting their products or services. These emails can be a nuisance and can clog up a user's inbox, making it difficult to find important messages.



Spam filters work by analyzing the content of incoming emails and identifying characteristics that are commonly associated with spam. For example, spam emails often contain certain words or phrases that are commonly used by spammers, such as ""free money"" or ""double your income.""

There are several different techniques that can be used to filter spam, including rules-based filtering, machine learning algorithms, and collaborative filtering. Rules-based filtering involves creating a set of rules or criteria that an email must meet in order to be considered spam. Machine learning algorithms are able to learn from examples of spam and non-spam emails and use this knowledge to identify new spam emails. Collaborative filtering involves analyzing the behavior of a group of users and using this information to identify spam emails.



Spam filtering is an important tool for helping users manage their email inboxes and protect their computers from potential threats. It is an ongoing process, as spammers continually find new ways to bypass filters and send unwanted emails.",,wiki_csai,18470
"Please explain what is ""Receiver operating characteristic""","A receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.  The method was originally developed for operators of military radar receivers starting in 1941, which led to its name.
The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection.[10] The false-positive rate is also known as probability of false alarm[10] and can be calculated as (1 − specificity). The ROC can also be thought of as a plot of the power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity or recall as a function of fall-out. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the cumulative distribution function (area under the probability distribution from 



−
∞


{\displaystyle -\infty }

 to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x-axis.
ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making.
The ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields and was soon introduced to psychology to account for perceptual detection of stimuli. ROC analysis since then has been used in medicine, radiology, biometrics, forecasting of natural hazards,[11] meteorology,[12] model performance assessment,[13] and other areas for many decades and is increasingly used in machine learning and data mining research.
The ROC is also known as a relative operating characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.[14]","Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. The true positive rate is the number of true positive results divided by the total number of positive results, while the false positive rate is the number of false positive results divided by the total number of negative results.



The ROC curve is a useful tool for evaluating and comparing the performance of different classifier models. A classifier with an ROC curve that is farther to the top left corner of the plot (toward the point (0,1)) is considered to be a better classifier, because it is able to correctly identify more positive cases while also minimizing the number of false positive cases.



In addition to the ROC curve, the area under the curve (AUC) is often used as a metric for evaluating classifier performance. A classifier with an AUC of 1 has perfect discrimination, while a classifier with an AUC of 0.5 has no discrimination ability.



ROC curves and AUC are widely used in a variety of applications, including medical diagnosis, credit scoring, and spam filtering.",,wiki_csai,18816
"Please explain what is ""Fuzzy control system""","A fuzzy control system is a control system based on fuzzy logic—a mathematical system that analyzes analog input values in terms of  logical variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or digital logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 (true or false, respectively).","A fuzzy control system is a type of control system that uses fuzzy logic to make decisions and determine the appropriate control actions. Fuzzy logic is a form of multi-valued logic that allows for the representation of uncertain or imprecise information. In a fuzzy control system, the control actions are determined by a set of rules that are defined using fuzzy logic.



Fuzzy control systems are used in a wide range of applications, including control of industrial processes, robotics, and autonomous systems. They are particularly useful in situations where the system being controlled is complex or the relationships between the input variables and the output variables are not well understood.



In a fuzzy control system, the input variables are first fuzzified, which means that they are translated into fuzzy sets. The fuzzy sets are then combined using the rules of fuzzy logic to determine the appropriate control action. The control action is then defuzzified, or translated back into a numerical value that can be used to control the system.



Fuzzy control systems have several advantages over traditional control systems. They are easy to design and implement, and they are able to handle uncertainty and imprecision in the input and output variables. They are also able to adapt to changing conditions and can handle multiple input variables simultaneously. However, they may be less accurate than traditional control systems in certain situations.",,wiki_csai,18847
"Please explain what is ""Apple Computer""","Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and, as of June 2022[update], is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.
Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by  Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.
As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as ""Wintel""). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching ""Think different"" and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.
Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then $2 trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3 trillion in January 2022. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.","Apple Computer, Inc. was a technology company that was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.

Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.","Civil engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, water and sewage systems, and buildings. Civil engineers work on the planning, design, construction, and operation of these infrastructure systems, as well as on the management of natural resources and the environment.

"Please explain what is ""Digital signature""","A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very high confidence that the message was created by a known sender (authenticity), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).
Digital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering.
Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, which includes any electronic data that carries the intent of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures. Electronic signatures have legal significance in some countries, including Canada, South Africa, the United States, Algeria, Turkey, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia,[10] Uruguay,[11] Switzerland, Chile[12] and the countries of the European Union.[13][14]
Digital signatures employ asymmetric cryptography. In many instances, they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects, but properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type. Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be effective. They can also provide non-repudiation, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret.[15] Further, some non-repudiation schemes offer a timestamp for the digital signature, so that even if the private key is exposed, the signature is valid.[16][17] Digitally signed messages may be anything representable as a bitstring: examples include electronic mail, contracts, or a message sent via some other cryptographic protocol.","A digital signature is a way of verifying the authenticity and integrity of a digital document or message. It is a cryptographic method that uses a private key to create a unique signature for a document, and a public key to verify the signature.



Digital signatures are commonly used to secure electronic communications, such as emails, and to authenticate the identity of the sender. They can also be used to verify the authenticity of digital documents, such as contracts, invoices, and legal documents.



To create a digital signature, the sender uses a digital certificate, which contains their public and private keys, to apply a unique code to the document. The private key is used to create the signature, and the public key is used to verify it. When the document is received, the recipient can use the sender's public key to verify the signature and confirm that the document has not been tampered with.



Digital signatures provide a high level of security and are widely used in a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, and government. They offer a secure and efficient way to authenticate the identity of the sender and ensure the integrity of the document.",,wiki_csai,19111
"Please explain what is ""Knowledge extraction""","Knowledge extraction is the creation of knowledge from structured (relational databases, XML) and unstructured (text, documents, images) sources. The resulting knowledge needs to be in a machine-readable and machine-interpretable format and must represent knowledge in a manner that facilitates inferencing. Although it is methodically similar to information extraction (NLP) and ETL (data warehouse), the main criterion is that the extraction result goes beyond the creation of structured information or the transformation into a relational schema. It requires either the reuse of existing formal knowledge (reusing identifiers or ontologies) or the generation of a schema based on the source data.
The RDB2RDF W3C group  is currently standardizing a language for extraction of resource description frameworks (RDF) from relational databases. Another popular example for knowledge extraction is the transformation of Wikipedia into structured data and also the mapping to existing knowledge (see DBpedia and Freebase).","Knowledge extraction is the process of identifying and extracting useful and relevant information from a variety of sources, such as text, databases, and other digital media.

"Please explain what is ""Church–Turing thesis""","In computability theory, the Church–Turing thesis (also known as computability thesis, the  Turing–Church thesis, the Church–Turing conjecture, Church's thesis, Church's conjecture, and Turing's thesis) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:
Church, Kleene, and Turing[11] proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is λ-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is general recursive. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below).
On the other hand, the Church–Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven, as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined.
Since its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church–Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics. The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind (see below).","The Church-Turing thesis is a fundamental principle in computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. It states that any computation that can be performed by a human using pen and paper can also be performed by a machine, as long as it is given the right instructions. In other words, the Church-Turing thesis asserts that all computations that are possible in principle can be performed by a computer.



The thesis is named after two influential figures in the history of computer science: Alonzo Church and Alan Turing. Church was a logician and mathematician who developed the concept of the ""effective calculability"" of functions, which formed the basis for the Church-Turing thesis. Turing was a computer scientist and mathematician who is widely considered to be the father of modern computer science. He developed the concept of the ""universal machine,"" which is a theoretical device that can perform any computation that is possible in principle.



The Church-Turing thesis has had a major impact on the field of computer science, and it remains an important principle in the field today. It has also sparked considerable debate and discussion among philosophers and computer scientists, as it raises a number of interesting questions about the nature of computation and the limits of what can be computed.",,wiki_csai,18330

"Please explain what is ""Mechanical calculator""","A mechanical calculator, or calculating machine, is a mechanical device used to perform the basic operations of arithmetic automatically, or (historically) a simulation such as an analog computer or a slide rule. Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small desktop computers and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the electronic calculator and the digital computer.
Surviving notes from Wilhelm Schickard in 1623 reveal that he designed and had built the earliest of the modern attempts at mechanizing calculation. His machine was composed of two sets of technologies: first an abacus made of Napier's bones, to simplify multiplications and divisions first described six years earlier in 1617, and for the mechanical part, it had a dialed pedometer to perform additions and subtractions.  A study of the surviving notes shows a machine that would have jammed after a few entries on the same dial, and that it could be damaged if a carry had to be propagated over a few digits (like adding 1 to 999). Schickard abandoned his project in 1624 and never mentioned it again until his death 11 years later in 1635.
Two decades after Schickard's supposedly failed attempt, in 1642, Blaise Pascal decisively solved these particular problems with his invention of the mechanical calculator. Co-opted into his father's labour as tax collector in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required; it was called Pascal's Calculator or Pascaline.
Thomas' arithmometer, the first commercially successful machine, was manufactured two hundred years later in 1851; it was the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale until the industrial production of the more successful Odhner Arithmometer in 1890.
The comptometer, introduced in 1887, was the first machine to use a keyboard that consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured in 1902, was the first to have a 10 key keyboard. Electric motors were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901. In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the Anita Mk VII from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all-electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came to a stop in the middle of the 1970s closing an industry that had lasted for 120 years.
Charles Babbage designed two new kinds of mechanical calculators, which were so big that they required the power of a steam engine to operate, and that were too sophisticated to be built in his lifetime.  The first one was an automatic mechanical calculator, his difference engine, which could automatically compute and print mathematical tables. In 1855, Georg Scheutz became the first of a handful of designers to succeed at building a smaller and simpler model of his difference engine. The second one was a programmable mechanical calculator, his analytical engine, which Babbage started to design in 1834; ""in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer. A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom""[10] making it infinitely programmable.[11] In 1937, Howard Aiken convinced IBM to design and build the ASCC/Mark I, the first machine of its kind, based on the architecture of the analytical engine;[12] when the machine was finished some hailed it as ""Babbage's dream come true"".[13]","A mechanical calculator is a calculating device that performs arithmetic operations using mechanical components such as gears, levers, and dials, rather than electronic components.

The weights are determined by a kernel function, which is a mathematical function that assigns a weight to each point based on its distance from the target point.



One of the key benefits of kernel regression is that it is flexible and can adapt to nonlinear relationships between the variables. It does not require any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, and can be used with any type of data, including continuous, categorical, and ordinal variables.

"Please explain what is ""Temporal difference""","Temporal difference (TD) learning refers to a class of model-free reinforcement learning methods which learn by bootstrapping from the current estimate of the value function. These methods sample from the environment, like Monte Carlo methods, and perform updates based on current estimates, like dynamic programming methods.
While Monte Carlo methods only adjust their estimates once the final outcome is known, TD methods adjust predictions to match later, more accurate, predictions about the future before the final outcome is known. This is a form of bootstrapping, as illustrated with the following example:
Temporal difference methods are related to the temporal difference model of animal learning.","Temporal difference (TD) learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to learn about the expected future rewards of an agent's actions in a Markov decision process (MDP). It is a type of model-free reinforcement learning, which means that it does not require a model of the environment or its transitions in order to learn.



In TD learning, the agent estimates the value of each state or action by using a temporal difference error (TD error) to update its value function. The TD error is calculated as the difference between the expected reward for an action and the actual reward received. This error is then used to update the value function, which guides the agent's decisions about which actions to take in the future.



TD learning can be used to learn value functions for both state values (the expected future reward of being in a particular state) and action values (the expected future reward of taking a particular action). It can also be used to learn about the expected future rewards of policies, which are sets of actions that the agent follows in different states.



TD learning has several advantages over other reinforcement learning algorithms. It is simple to implement, and it can learn online, meaning that it can update its value function as it receives new rewards and transitions. It is also effective at handling delayed rewards, which are common in many real-world environments.",,wiki_csai,18840
"Please explain what is ""Drug design""","Drug design, often referred to as rational drug design or simply rational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein, which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design. In addition to small molecules, biopharmaceuticals including peptides and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed.
The phrase ""drug design"" is to some extent a misnomer. A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug.  Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to select compounds with more favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and toxicological profiles.","Drug design, also known as rational drug design or rational design, is the process of identifying and developing new drugs based on a thorough understanding of the biological target. This approach seeks to optimize the therapeutic benefits of a drug while minimizing its potential adverse effects.



In drug design, scientists use a variety of techniques, such as computer modeling, to understand the structure and function of the biological target and to identify potential drug candidates that can interact with the target in a specific and desired way. The goal is to design a molecule that will bind to the target in a way that either activates or inhibits its function, depending on the desired therapeutic effect.



Once a potential drug candidate has been identified, it undergoes a series of preclinical and clinical trials to evaluate its safety, efficacy, and potential side effects. If the drug candidate is shown to be effective and safe, it may be approved for use as a medication.



Overall, the goal of drug design is to develop new and effective treatments for a wide range of diseases and medical conditions, including cancer, infections, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.",,wiki_csai,18569
"Please explain what is ""Machine perception""","Machine perception is the capability of a computer system to interpret data in a manner that is similar to the way humans use their senses to relate to the world around them. The basic method that the computers take in and respond to their environment is through the attached hardware.  Until recently input was limited to a keyboard, or a mouse, but advances in technology, both in hardware and software, have allowed computers to take in sensory input in a way similar to humans.
Machine perception allows the computer to use this sensory input, as well as conventional computational means of gathering information, to gather information with greater accuracy and to present it in a way that is more comfortable for the user. These include computer vision, machine hearing, machine touch, and machine smelling, as artificial scents are, at a chemical compound, molecular, atomic level, indiscernible and identical.
The end goal of machine perception is to give machines the ability to see, feel and perceive the world as humans do and therefore for them to be able to explain in a human way why they are making their decisions, to warn us when it is failing and more importantly, the reason why it is failing. This purpose is very similar to the proposed purposes for artificial intelligence generally, except that machine perception would only grant machines limited sentience, rather than bestow upon machines full consciousness, self-awareness, and intentionality.","Machine perception is the ability of a machine to interpret and understand sensory data from its environment, such as images, sounds, and other inputs. It involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, to enable machines to recognize patterns, classify objects and events, and make decisions based on this information.



The goal of machine perception is to enable machines to understand and interpret the world around them in a way that is similar to how humans perceive their surroundings. This can be used to enable a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous robots.



There are many challenges associated with machine perception, including the need to accurately process and interpret large amounts of data, the need to adapt to changing environments, and the need to make decisions in real-time.

"Please explain what is ""Internet traffic""","Internet traffic is the flow of data within the entire Internet, or in certain network links of its constituent networks. Common traffic measurements are total volume, in units of multiples of the byte, or as transmission rates in bytes per certain time units.
As the topology of the Internet is not hierarchical, no single point of measurement is possible for total Internet traffic. Traffic data may be obtained from the Tier 1 network providers' peering points for indications of volume and growth. However, Such data excludes traffic that remains within a single service provider's network and traffic that crosses private peering points.
As of December 2022 India and China controls almost half(48%) of the Internet traffic where as once a majority but now North America, Europe’s share got reduced to a quarter of the traffic of global internet.","Internet traffic refers to the amount of data that is transmitted over the internet at a given time. This data can include a variety of things, such as emails, web pages, video and audio files, and other types of information that are transmitted between devices connected to the internet. Internet traffic is measured in a variety of ways, including by the number of bits or bytes transmitted per second, the number of packets transmitted, or the number of connections made to a particular website or service.



There are many factors that can affect the amount of internet traffic at a given time, including the number of people using the internet, the type of content being accessed, and the time of day. Internet traffic tends to be highest during peak hours, when many people are using the internet at the same time, and it tends to be lower during off-peak hours.



Understanding internet traffic can be important for a variety of reasons. For example, internet service providers may need to manage their networks to ensure that they can handle the amount of traffic being transmitted at a given time, and website owners may need to optimize their sites to ensure that they can handle the traffic they receive. Additionally, understanding internet traffic patterns can help businesses and organizations better understand how people are using the internet and how they can better reach and engage with their target audience online.",,wiki_csai,18463
"Please explain what is ""Predicate (mathematical logic)""","In logic, a predicate is a symbol which represents a property or a relation. For instance, in the first order formula 



P
(
a

P


{\displaystyle P}

 is a predicate which applies to the individual constant 



a

 would be true on an interpretation if the entities denoted by 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 and 



b


{\displaystyle b}

 stand in the relation denoted by 



R


{\displaystyle R}

. Since predicates are non-logical symbols, they can denote different relations depending on the interpretation used to interpret them. While first-order logic only includes predicates which apply to individual constants, other logics may allow predicates which apply to other predicates.","In mathematical logic, a predicate is a statement that can be either true or false, depending on the values of its variables. For example, ""x is greater than y"" is a predicate, because it is either true or false depending on the values of x and y. Predicates are often used to define the properties of a set or the relationship between different elements in a set.



In formal logic, predicates are usually written using a capital letter followed by a sequence of variables. For example, ""P(x)"" is a predicate that takes a single variable x. ""Q(x,y)"" is a predicate that takes two variables, x and y. The values of the variables are often referred to as arguments of the predicate.



Predicates can be combined using logical connectives such as ""and"", ""or"", and ""not"" to form more complex statements. For example, ""P(x) and Q(x,y)"" is a predicate that is true if both P(x) and Q(x,y) are true.



Predicates are often used in logical systems such as first-order logic to express the relationships between different objects or concepts. They play a central role in the study of mathematical logic and are widely used in computer science, artificial intelligence, and other fields.",,wiki_csai,18422
"Please explain what is ""Boolean network""","A Boolean network consists of a discrete set of boolean variables each of which has a Boolean function (possibly different for each variable) assigned to it which takes inputs from a subset of those variables and output that determines the state of the variable it is assigned to.  This set of functions in effect determines a topology (connectivity) on the set of variables, which then become nodes in a network. Usually, the dynamics of the system is taken as a discrete time series where the state of the entire network at time t+1 is determined by evaluating each variable's function on the state of the network at time t.  This may be done synchronously or asynchronously.
Boolean networks have been used in biology to model regulatory networks. Although Boolean networks are a crude simplification of genetic reality where genes are not simple binary switches, there are several cases where they correctly convey the correct pattern of expressed and suppressed genes. 
The seemingly mathematical easy (synchronous) model was only fully understood in the mid 2000s.","A Boolean network is a mathematical model used to represent the behavior of a dynamic system as a network of Boolean variables and functions. The variables in a Boolean network can have only two states: ""true"" or ""false,"" and the functions specify the rules for how the variables update their states based on the states of other variables in the network.



Boolean networks are often used to model the behavior of complex systems, such as genetic regulatory networks or social networks. They are particularly useful for studying the behavior of systems that exhibit binary (either/or) behavior, or for modeling the interactions between different components of a system.



In a Boolean network, each variable is represented by a node in the network, and the functions specifying the rules for updating the state of each variable are represented by edges connecting the nodes. The state of the network at any given time can be represented by the configuration of the nodes, and the dynamics of the network can be studied by iteratively updating the state of the nodes according to the rules specified by the edges.



Boolean networks have been used in a variety of applications, including the study of cellular automata, the analysis of biological systems, and the design of computer circuits. They have also been used to study the behavior of social and economic systems, as well as the spread of diseases and information.",,wiki_csai,18595
"Please explain what is ""Covariance function""","In probability theory and statistics, the covariance function describes how much two random variables change together (their covariance) with varying spatial or temporal separation. For a random field or stochastic process Z(x) on a domain D, a covariance function C(x, y) gives the covariance of the values of the random field at the two locations x and y:
The same C(x, y) is called the autocovariance function in two instances: in time series (to denote exactly the same concept except that x and y refer to locations in time rather than in space), and in multivariate random fields (to refer to the covariance of a variable with itself, as opposed to the cross covariance between two different variables at different locations, Cov(Z(x1), Y(x2))).","In statistics, a covariance function is a function that describes the covariance between two variables as a function of the distance between those variables. In other words, it is a measure of the degree to which two variables are related or vary together.



The covariance between two variables x and y is defined as:



Cov(x, y) = E[(x - E[x])(y - E[y])]



where E[x] is the expected value (mean) of x and E[y] is the expected value of y.



The covariance function can be used to understand the relationship between two variables. If the covariance is positive, it means that the two variables tend to vary together in the same direction (when one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well). If the covariance is negative, it means that the two variables tend to vary in opposite directions (when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease). If the covariance is zero, it means that the two variables are independent and do not have any relationship.



Covariance functions are often used in statistics and machine learning to model the relationships between variables and make predictions. They can also be used to quantify the uncertainty or risk associated with a particular investment or decision.",,wiki_csai,18794
"Please explain what is ""Computability theory""","Computability theory, also known as recursion theory, is a branch of mathematical logic, computer science, and the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees.

Basic questions addressed by computability theory include:
Although there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematical computability theorists study the theory of relative computability, reducibility notions, and degree structures; those in the computer science field focus on the theory of subrecursive hierarchies, formal methods, and formal languages.","Computability theory is a branch of mathematical logic and computer science that deals with the question of which problems can be solved by algorithms, that is, systematic procedures for performing calculations. It is concerned with the study of what can be computed and how efficiently it can be done.



Computability theory is related to, but distinct from, the study of algorithms and complexity theory, which deal with the design and analysis of algorithms for solving problems.



The central objects of study in computability theory are the computable functions, which are the functions that can be calculated by an algorithm. A function is said to be computable if there is a systematic procedure or algorithm for calculating its output for any given input. The study of computable functions is also known as recursive function theory.



One of the fundamental results of computability theory is the Church-Turing thesis, which states that any function that can be computed by a human using pencil and paper can also be computed by a machine. This result has been instrumental in the development of modern computers and has led to the development of the theory of computation, which is the mathematical study of algorithms and their computational complexity.

It refers to the way that a program is intended to behave, and how it is intended to be used.



There are several different ways to specify program semantics, including using natural language descriptions, using mathematical notation, or using a specific formalism such as a programming language.



Some common approaches to specifying program semantics include:



Operational semantics: This approach specifies the meaning of a program by describing the sequence of steps that the program will take when it is executed.



Denotational semantics: This approach specifies the meaning of a program by defining a mathematical function that maps the program to a value.



Axiomatic semantics: This approach specifies the meaning of a program by defining a set of axioms that describe the program's behavior.



Structural operational semantics: This approach specifies the meaning of a program by describing the rules that govern the transformation of the program's syntax into its semantics.

In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration). The implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors, spintronic memories, threshold switches, transistors, among others. Training software-based neuromorphic systems of spiking neural networks can be achieved using error backpropagation, e.g., using Python based frameworks such as snnTorch,[10] or using canonical learning rules from the biological learning literature, e.g., using BindsNet.[11]
A key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.
Neuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and electronic engineering to design artificial neural systems, such as vision systems, head-eye systems, auditory processors, and autonomous robots, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems.[12] One of the first applications for neuromorphic engineering was proposed by Carver Mead[13] in the late 1980s.","Neuromorphic computing is a type of computing that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

Predictive techniques, such as forecasting, can be applied, but contemporary futures studies scholars emphasize the importance of systematically exploring alternatives. In general, it can be considered as a branch of the social sciences and an extension to the field of history. Futures studies (colloquially called ""futures"" by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change. Part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present, and to explore the possibility of future events and trends.
Unlike the physical sciences where a narrower, more specified system is studied, futurology concerns a much bigger and more complex world system.

This approach to machine translation has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the advances in natural language processing and the availability of large amounts of data and computing power.



In neural machine translation, the translation process is modeled as a sequence-to-sequence task, where the input is a source language sentence and the output is the corresponding translation in the target language. The neural network is trained on a large dataset of translated sentences, and it learns to generate translations by predicting the next word in the target language based on the context of the source language sentence and the previously generated words in the target language.



One of the key advantages of neural machine translation is that it can handle long and complex sentences and handle multiple languages at the same time.

The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019[update], Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license.

"Please explain what is ""Hardware acceleration""","Hardware acceleration is the use of computer hardware designed to perform specific functions more efficiently when compared to software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU). Any transformation of data that can be calculated in software running on a generic CPU can also be calculated in custom-made hardware, or in some mix of both.
To perform computing tasks more quickly (or better in some other way), generally one can invest time and money in improving the software, improving the hardware, or both. There are various approaches with advantages and disadvantages in terms of decreased latency, increased throughput and reduced energy consumption. Typical advantages of focusing on software may include more rapid development, lower non-recurring engineering costs, heightened portability, and ease of updating features or patching bugs, at the cost of overhead to compute general operations. Advantages of focusing on hardware may include speedup, reduced power consumption, lower latency, increased parallelism and bandwidth, and better utilization of area and functional components available on an integrated circuit; at the cost of lower ability to update designs once etched onto silicon and higher costs of functional verification, and times to market. In the hierarchy of digital computing systems ranging from general-purpose processors to fully customized hardware, there is a tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency, with efficiency increasing by orders of magnitude when any given application is implemented higher up that hierarchy. This hierarchy includes general-purpose processors such as CPUs, more specialized processors such as GPUs, fixed-function implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and fixed-function implemented on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).
Hardware acceleration is advantageous for performance, and practical when the functions are fixed so updates are not as needed as in software solutions. With the advent of reprogrammable logic devices such as FPGAs, the restriction of hardware acceleration to fully fixed algorithms has eased since 2010, allowing hardware acceleration to be applied to problem domains requiring modification to algorithms and processing control flow.[10] The disadvantage however, is that in many open source projects, it requires proprietary libraries that not all vendors are keen to distribute or expose, making it difficult to integrate in such projects.","Hardware acceleration refers to the use of computer hardware, specifically hardware designed to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU). By using hardware acceleration, a computer can perform certain tasks faster and more efficiently than it could with just a CPU.



Hardware acceleration is often used in graphics and video processing, as these tasks can be very resource-intensive and can benefit greatly from specialized hardware. For example, a graphics processing unit (GPU) is a type of hardware designed specifically to handle the complex calculations required to render images and video. By offloading these tasks to the GPU, the CPU is free to perform other tasks, resulting in improved overall performance.



Hardware acceleration can also be used in other areas, such as data processing, encryption, and network communication. In these cases, specialized hardware such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) may be used to perform certain tasks more efficiently than a CPU.



Overall, hardware acceleration can help to improve the performance and efficiency of a computer by taking advantage of specialized hardware designed to perform specific tasks faster and more efficiently than a general-purpose CPU.",,wiki_csai,18825
"Please explain what is ""Brain simulation""","Brain simulation is the concept of creating a functioning computer model of a brain or part of a brain. Brain simulation projects intend to contribute to a complete understanding of the brain, and eventually also assist the process of treating and diagnosing brain diseases.
Various simulations from around the world have been fully or partially released as open source software, such as C. elegans, and the Blue Brain Project Showcase. In 2013 the Human Brain Project, which has utilized techniques used by the Blue Brain Project and built upon them, created a Brain Simulation Platform (BSP), an internet-accessible collaborative platform designed for the simulation of brain models.","Brain simulation is a field of study that aims to create a computational model of the human brain or certain aspects of it. The goal of brain simulation is to understand how the brain works and to use this understanding to develop new technologies, such as artificial intelligence systems or brain-machine interfaces.



There are several approaches to brain simulation, including:



Empirical brain simulation: This approach involves building a model of the brain based on data collected from brain imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET).



Theoretical brain simulation: This approach involves building a model of the brain based on our current understanding of brain function and using this model to make predictions about brain activity.



Hybrid brain simulation: This approach combines elements of both empirical and theoretical brain simulation, using data from brain imaging techniques to refine and validate theoretical models of brain function.



Brain simulation is a complex and challenging task, as the human brain is an incredibly complex organ made up of billions of neurons and trillions of connections. However, advances in computing power and techniques for analyzing and modeling brain activity have made it possible to make significant progress in understanding the brain and developing new technologies based on this understanding.",,wiki_csai,18996
"Please explain what is ""Turing test""","The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.
The test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" while working at the University of Manchester. It opens with the words: ""I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'"" Because ""thinking"" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to ""replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."" Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three-person game called the ""imitation game"", in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players. Turing's new question is: ""Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?"" This question, Turing believed, was one that could actually be answered. In the remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that ""machines can think"".
Since Turing introduced his test, it has been both highly influential and widely criticised, and has become an important concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Some of its criticisms, such as John Searle's Chinese room, are themselves controversial.","The Turing Test is a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. It is named after Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computer scientist who proposed the test in 1950.



The test is conducted by having a human judge engage in natural language conversations with another human and with a machine, and then deciding which of the two they are communicating with. If the judge cannot reliably tell which is the machine and which is the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.



The Turing Test is often used as a benchmark for determining whether a machine exhibits artificial intelligence, although it is not a perfect measure. Some critics argue that the test is too limited in scope, as it only measures a machine's ability to mimic human conversation and does not take into account other forms of intelligent behavior. Others argue that the test is too subjective, as it relies on the judgments of individual human judges. Despite these criticisms, the Turing Test remains a widely recognized and influential concept in the field of artificial intelligence.",,wiki_csai,18491
"Please explain what is ""Explainable AI""","Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It contrasts with the ""black box"" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.  XAI is relevant even if there is no legal right or regulatory requirement. For example, XAI can improve the user experience of a product or service by helping end users trust that the AI is making good decisions. This way the aim of XAI is to explain what has been done, what is done right now, what will be done next and unveil the information the actions are based on. These characteristics make it possible (i) to confirm existing knowledge (ii) to challenge existing knowledge and (iii) to generate new assumptions.
The algorithms used in AI can be differentiated into white-box and black-box machine learning (ML) algorithms. White-box models are ML models that provide results that are understandable for experts in the domain. Black-box models, on the other hand, are extremely hard to explain and can hardly be understood even by domain experts.[10] XAI algorithms are considered to follow the three principles of transparency, interpretability and explainability. Transparency is given “if the processes that extract model parameters from training data and generate labels from testing data can be described and motivated by the approach designer”.[11] Interpretability describes the possibility of comprehending the ML model and presenting the underlying basis for decision-making in a way that is understandable to humans.[12][13][14] Explainability is a concept that is recognized as important, but a joint definition is not yet available.[11] It is suggested that explainability in ML can be considered as “the collection of features of the interpretable domain, that have contributed for a given example to produce a decision (e.g., classification or regression)”.[15] If algorithms meet these requirements, they provide a basis for justifying decisions, tracking and thereby verifying them, improving the algorithms, and exploring new facts.[16]
Sometimes it is also possible to achieve a result with high accuracy with a white-box ML algorithm that is interpretable in itself.[17] This is especially important in domains like medicine, defense, finance and law, where it is crucial to understand the decisions and build up trust in the algorithms. Many researchers argue that, at least for supervised machine learning, the way forward is symbolic regression, where the algorithm searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset.[18][19][20]
AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command ""maximize accuracy of assessing how positive film reviews are in the test dataset"". The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as ""reviews containing the word 'horrible' are likely to be negative"". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as ""reviews containing 'Daniel Day-Lewis' are usually positive""; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the train set, or if people consider the rule to be ""cheating"" or ""unfair"". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.[21]","Explainable AI, also known as XAI, refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can provide clear and understandable explanations for their decision-making processes and predictions. The goal of XAI is to create AI systems that are transparent and interpretable, so that humans can understand how and why the AI is making certain decisions.



In contrast to traditional AI systems, which often rely on complex algorithms and machine learning models that are difficult for humans to interpret, XAI aims to make AI more transparent and accountable. This is important because it can help to increase trust in AI systems, as well as improve their effectiveness and efficiency.



There are various approaches to building explainable AI, including using simpler models, introducing human-readable rules or constraints into the AI system, and developing techniques for visualizing and interpreting the inner workings of AI models.



Explainable AI has a wide range of applications, including healthcare, finance, and government, where transparency and accountability are critical concerns. It is also an active area of research in the field of AI, with researchers working on developing new techniques and approaches for making AI systems more transparent and interpretable.",,wiki_csai,18498
"Please explain what is ""Leaf node""","In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes. Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent. These constraints mean there are no cycles or ""loops"" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes in a single straight line.
Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of children for each parent to exactly two. When the order of the children is specified, this data structure corresponds to an  ordered tree in graph theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children.
The abstract data type can be represented in a number of ways, including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list). Representations might also be more complicated, for example using indexes or ancestor lists for performance.
Trees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and trees in descriptive set theory.","In a tree data structure, a leaf node is a node that does not have any children. Leaf nodes are also sometimes referred to as terminal nodes.



A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node in a tree is called the root node, and the nodes below the root node are called child nodes. A node can have one or more child nodes, which are called its children. If a node has no children, it is called a leaf node. Leaf nodes are the endpoints of the tree, and they do not have any further branches.



For example, in a tree representing a file system, the leaf nodes might represent files, while the non-leaf nodes represent folders. In a decision tree, leaf nodes might represent the final decision or classification based on the values of the features or attributes.



Leaf nodes are important in tree data structures because they represent the endpoints of the tree. They are used to store data, and they are often used to make decisions or perform actions based on the data stored in the leaf nodes.",,wiki_csai,18773
"Please explain what is ""Machine vision""","Machine vision (MV) is the technology and methods used to provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection,  process control, and robot guidance, usually in industry. Machine vision refers to many technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods and expertise. Machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision, a form of computer science. It attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems. The term is the prevalent one for these functions in industrial automation environments but is also used for these functions in other environment vehicle guidance.
The overall machine vision process includes planning the details of the requirements and project, and then creating a solution. During run-time, the process starts with imaging, followed by  automated analysis of the image and extraction of the required information.","Machine vision is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves using computer algorithms and hardware to enable a machine to interpret and understand visual data from the world. It is concerned with the development of algorithms and systems that can automatically process, analyze, and understand images and videos.

Some examples of machine vision tasks include object recognition, image classification, object tracking, and scene understanding. These tasks are often achieved using a combination of computer vision algorithms, such as feature detection and matching, and machine learning techniques, such as deep learning.



Overall, the goal of machine vision is to enable machines to perceive and understand the world in a way that is similar to how humans do, allowing them to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do on their own.",,wiki_csai,18887
"Please explain what is ""Video game""","Video games,[a] also known as computer games, are electronic games that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.
Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.
The first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.
In the 2000s, the core industry centered on ""AAA"" games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development (or indie games) to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the size of the 2019 global music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry.","A video game is a digital game that is played on a computer or other electronic device. It typically involves interacting with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. Video games can be played either alone, with other players through the internet or locally, or with a combination of both. They can be classified into a variety of genres based on the type of gameplay, such as action, adventure, role-playing, strategy, simulation, and sports. Some video games are designed to be educational or to teach certain skills, while others are purely for entertainment. Video games have become a popular form of entertainment and are enjoyed by people of all ages.",,wiki_csai,19122
"Please explain what is ""Dictionary learning""","Sparse coding is a representation learning method which aims at finding a sparse representation of the input data (also known as sparse coding) in the form of a linear combination of basic elements as well as those basic elements themselves. These elements are called atoms and they compose a dictionary. Atoms in the dictionary are not required to be orthogonal, and they may be an over-complete spanning set. This problem setup also allows the dimensionality of the signals being represented to be higher than the one of the signals being observed. The above two properties lead to having seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple representations of the same signal but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation.
One of the most important applications of sparse dictionary learning is in the field of compressed sensing or signal recovery. In compressed sensing, a high-dimensional signal can be recovered with only a few linear measurements provided that the signal is sparse or nearly sparse. Since not all signals satisfy this sparsity condition, it is of great importance to find a sparse representation of that signal such as the wavelet transform or the directional gradient of a rasterized matrix. Once a matrix or a high dimensional vector is transferred to a sparse space, different recovery algorithms like basis pursuit, CoSaMP or fast non-iterative algorithms can be used to recover the signal.
One of the key principles of dictionary learning is that the dictionary has to be inferred from the input data. The emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated by the fact that in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible. Before this approach the general practice was to use predefined dictionaries (such as Fourier or wavelet transforms). However, in certain cases a dictionary that is trained to fit the input data can significantly improve the sparsity, which has applications in data decomposition, compression and analysis and has been used in the fields of image denoising and classification, video and audio processing. Sparsity and overcomplete dictionaries have immense applications in image compression, image fusion and inpainting.","Dictionary learning is a machine learning technique used to represent a set of data points as a linear combination of a fixed set of ""atoms"" or basis elements. The goal of dictionary learning is to find a compact and efficient representation of the data, where each data point can be represented as a linear combination of a small number of atoms.



In dictionary learning, the atoms are typically chosen to be a set of representative basis elements that capture the structure and patterns in the data. The coefficients of the linear combination (also called the ""codes"") are then used to reconstruct the data points.



Dictionary learning can be used for various tasks, such as image and signal processing, natural language processing, and data compression. It has been widely used in many applications, including image denoising, image super-resolution, and image inpainting, to name a few.



Dictionary learning algorithms typically involve an optimization process to find the atoms and codes that best represent the data. There are various algorithms and approaches for dictionary learning, including methods based on matrix factorization, gradient descent, and alternating optimization.",,wiki_csai,18743
"Please explain what is ""Earth science""","Earth science or geoscience includes all fields of natural science related to the planet Earth. This is a branch of science dealing with the physical, chemical, and biological complex constitutions and synergistic linkages of Earth's four spheres, namely biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and geosphere. Earth science can be considered to be a branch of planetary science, but with a much older history. Earth science encompasses four main branches of study, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere, each of which is further broken down into more specialized fields.
There are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth sciences. It is also the study of Earth and its neighbors in space. Some Earth scientists use their knowledge of the planet to locate and develop energy and mineral resources. Others study the impact of human activity on Earth's environment, and design methods to protect the planet. Some use their knowledge about Earth processes such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes to plan communities that will not expose people to these dangerous events.
Earth sciences can include the study of geology, the lithosphere, and the large-scale structure of Earth's interior, as well as the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Typically, Earth scientists use tools from geology, chronology, physics, chemistry, geography, biology, and mathematics to build a quantitative understanding of how Earth works and evolves. For example, meteorologists study the weather and watch for dangerous storms. Hydrologists examine water and warn of floods. Seismologists study earthquakes and try to understand where they will strike. Geologists study rocks and help to locate useful minerals. Earth scientists often work in the field—perhaps climbing mountains, exploring the seabed, crawling through caves, or wading in swamps. They measure and collect samples (such as rocks or river water), then record their findings on charts and maps.","Earth science is a branch of science that deals with the study of the Earth and its natural processes, as well as the history of the Earth and the universe.

"Please explain what is ""Dune (novel)""","Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally published as two separate serials in Analog magazine. It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966 and it won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. It is the first installment of the Dune saga. In 2003, it was described as the world's best-selling science fiction novel.
Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs.  It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or ""spice"", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.
Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.
Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to a mostly negative response from critics and failed at the box office. The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune). A second film adaptation directed by Denis Villeneuve was released on October 21, 2021, to generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $401 million worldwide. It also went on to win six Academy Awards. Villeneuve's film was essentially the first half of the original novel, and a sequel, which will cover the remaining story, has begun production and is set for release in 2023.

It is the first book in the ""Dune"" series, which consists of six main novels and a number of spin-off works.



The novel is set in the distant future and follows the story of Paul Atreides, the son of a noble family who are given control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only known source of the spice melange, a valuable and highly sought-after substance. Paul and his family must navigate the complex and dangerous politics of the planet, as well as deal with the native population, the Fremen, who have adapted to the harsh desert conditions and have their own secret society and ancient traditions.



As Paul becomes more involved in the politics of Arrakis, he discovers that he has been chosen by fate to become the messiah of the Fremen and lead them in a rebellion against their oppressors. Along the way, he must confront powerful enemies and difficult personal choices, and he learns about the power of prophecy and the nature of human destiny.

"Please explain what is ""Computational science""","Computational science, also known as scientific computing or scientific computation (SC), is a field in mathematics that uses advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. It is an area of science that spans many disciplines[which?], but at its core, it involves the development of models and simulations to understand natural systems.
In practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation from numerical analysis and theoretical computer science to solve problems in various scientific disciplines. The field is different from theory and laboratory experiments, which are the traditional forms of science and engineering. The scientific computing approach is to gain understanding through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers. Scientists and engineers develop computer programs and application software that model systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input parameters. The essence of computational science is the application of numerical algorithms and computational mathematics. In some cases, these models require massive amounts of calculations (usually floating-point) and are often executed on supercomputers or distributed computing platforms.[verification needed]","Computational science is an interdisciplinary field that uses computers and algorithms to simulate, analyze, and understand complex systems and phenomena. It involves the development and use of computational models and simulations to solve problems in science, engineering, and other fields.



Computational science draws on a wide range of disciplines, including mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering, and it can be applied to a wide variety of problems. For example, computational science can be used to study the behavior of fluids, the structure of materials, the evolution of biological systems, the behavior of economic systems, and many other phenomena.



The use of computers and algorithms to solve complex problems has become increasingly important in recent years, as the complexity and scale of many problems has grown beyond the capabilities of traditional analytical methods. Computational science allows researchers to perform experiments and analyze data in ways that would be impractical or impossible using traditional methods. It has also made it possible to study and understand complex systems that were previously too difficult to analyze, such as the behavior of large-scale systems in biology or the behavior of financial markets.",,wiki_csai,19080
"Please explain what is ""Deep structure""","Deep structure and surface structure (also D-structure and S-structure although those abbreviated forms are sometimes used with distinct meanings) are concepts used in linguistics, specifically in the study of syntax in the Chomskyan tradition of transformational generative grammar.
The deep structure of a linguistic expression is a theoretical construct that seeks to unify several related structures.  For example, the sentences ""Pat loves Chris"" and ""Chris is loved by Pat"" mean roughly the same thing and use similar words.  Some linguists, Chomsky in particular, have tried to account for this similarity by positing that these two sentences are distinct surface forms that derive from a common (or very similar) deep structure.","In linguistics, the term ""deep structure"" refers to the underlying meaning and structure of a sentence or phrase, which is thought to be the source of the surface structure or the way that the sentence is actually expressed. This concept was developed by Noam Chomsky and his followers as part of their theory of transformational grammar, which proposes that the deep structure of a sentence is transformed into its surface structure through a series of rules.



According to this theory, the deep structure of a sentence consists of the underlying syntactic and semantic relationships between the words and phrases in the sentence. It is thought to be the source of the various surface structures that a sentence can have, depending on the context in which it is used and the rules that are applied to transform it.



For example, consider the following sentence: ""The cat sat on the mat."" This sentence has a simple deep structure that consists of a subject (""the cat""), a verb (""sat""), and an object (""the mat""). The surface structure of this sentence is the specific way that it is expressed, with the words arranged in a particular order and with specific inflections applied to the verb.



Deep structure is an important concept in linguistics because it helps to explain how the meaning of a sentence is conveyed and how different surface structures can be derived from a single deep structure. It is also a key component of many theories of language and how it is processed in the brain.",,wiki_csai,18376
"Please explain what is ""Natural-language understanding""","Natural-language understanding (NLU) or natural-language interpretation (NLI) is a subtopic  of natural-language processing in artificial intelligence that deals with machine reading comprehension. Natural-language understanding is considered an AI-hard problem.
There is considerable commercial interest in the field because of its application to automated reasoning, machine translation, question answering, news-gathering, text categorization, voice-activation, archiving, and large-scale content analysis.","Natural-language understanding (NLU) is a subfield of natural-language processing (NLP) that focuses on the ability of a computer to analyze, understand, and interpret human language.

"Please explain what is ""Direct marketing""","Direct marketing is a form of communicating an offer, where organizations communicate directly to a pre-selected customer and supply a method for a direct response. Among practitioners, it is also known as direct response marketing. By contrast, advertising is of a mass-message nature.
Response channels include toll-free telephone numbers, reply cards, reply forms to be sent in an envelope, websites and email addresses.
The prevalence of direct marketing and the unwelcome nature of some communications has led to regulations and laws such as the CAN-SPAM Act, requiring that consumers in the United States be allowed to opt-out.","Direct marketing is a type of advertising in which businesses communicate directly with consumers through various channels such as email, SMS, and social media. The goal of direct marketing is to reach and engage with consumers directly, often with the aim of encouraging them to make a purchase or take some other specific action.



Direct marketing campaigns typically involve the use of targeted lists of consumers who have expressed an interest in a particular product or service. These lists can be compiled from a variety of sources, including customer databases, website traffic data, and purchasing history.



One of the key advantages of direct marketing is that it allows businesses to track the effectiveness of their campaigns through metrics such as open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates. This enables businesses to identify which strategies are working and which are not, and to make adjustments accordingly.



There are several different types of direct marketing, including:



Email marketing: This involves sending promotional messages or newsletters to a list of email addresses.

SMS marketing: This involves sending text messages to a list of phone numbers.

Social media marketing: This involves promoting products or services through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Direct mail: This involves sending promotional materials, such as brochures or catalogs, through the mail.

"Please explain what is ""Type systems""","In computer programming, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to every ""term"" (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Usually the terms are various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. A type system dictates the operations that can be performed on a term. For variables, the type system determines the allowed values of that term. Type systems formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components (e.g. ""string"", ""array of float"", ""function returning boolean"").
Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages and built into interpreters and compilers, although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar. The main purpose of a type system in a programming language is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs due to type errors. The given type system in question determines what constitutes a type error, but in general, the aim is to prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values for which that operation does not make sense (validity errors). Type systems allow defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or as a combination of both. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, and providing a form of documentation.","In computer science, a type system is a set of rules that assigns a property called a ""type"" to the various constructs in a programming language, such as variables, expressions, and functions. The purpose of a type system is to reduce the likelihood of runtime type errors by ensuring that type-related rules are followed during program execution.



There are several different kinds of type systems, including static type systems and dynamic type systems. In a static type system, type checking is performed at compile time, before the program is executed. This means that type errors can be detected and fixed before the program is run. In a dynamic type system, type checking is performed at runtime, as the program is being executed. This means that type errors may not be detected until the program is run, and they may cause the program to fail at runtime.



Type systems can also vary in the degree of type safety they provide. A type-safe language is one in which type errors are not possible, or at least are very unlikely to occur. A type-unsafe language is one in which type errors are more common and may be easier to introduce into a program.



Overall, type systems are an important tool for ensuring the reliability and correctness of programs, and they are an essential part of many programming languages.",,wiki_csai,19103
"Please explain what is ""Human intelligence""","Human intelligence is the intellectual capability of humans, which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self-awareness. High intelligence is associated with better outcomes in life.
Through intelligence, humans possess the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, apply logic and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, plan, innovate, solve problems, make decisions, retain information, and use language to communicate. There are conflicting ideas about how intelligence is measured, ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed upon birth, or that it is malleable and can change depending on an individual's mindset and efforts. Several subcategories of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence or social intelligence, are heavily debated as to whether they are traditional forms of intelligence. They are generally thought to be distinct processes that occur, though there is speculation that they tie into traditional intelligence more than previously suspected.","Human intelligence is the mental ability to think, learn, and understand concepts.

The Bernoulli numbers were discovered around the same time by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, after whom they are named, and independently by Japanese mathematician Seki Takakazu.  Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712 in his work Katsuyō Sanpō; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his Ars Conjectandi of 1713.  Ada Lovelace's note G on the Analytical Engine from 1842 describes an algorithm for generating Bernoulli numbers with Babbage's machine. As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first published complex computer program.","In mathematics, the Bernoulli numbers are a sequence of rational numbers that occur in the expansion of certain functions. They are named after Jacob Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician who studied these numbers in the 17th century.



There are two different definitions of Bernoulli numbers, one for even numbers and one for odd numbers. The nth even Bernoulli number, denoted by B2n, is defined as the coefficient of the x2n term in the Taylor series expansion of the function ex/(ex + 1). The nth odd Bernoulli number, denoted by B2n+1, is defined as the coefficient of the x2n+1 term in the same expansion.



The first few Bernoulli numbers are:



B0 = 1

B1 = -1/2

B2 = 1/6

B3 = 0

B4 = -1/30

B5 = 0

B6 = 1/42

B7 = 0

"Please explain what is ""Tactile sensor""","A tactile sensor is a device that measures information arising from physical interaction with its environment. Tactile sensors are generally modeled after the biological sense of cutaneous touch which is capable of detecting stimuli resulting from mechanical stimulation, temperature, and pain (although pain sensing is not common in artificial tactile sensors). Tactile sensors are used in robotics, computer hardware and security systems. A common application of tactile sensors is in touchscreen devices on mobile phones and computing.
Tactile sensors may be of different types including piezoresistive, piezoelectric, optical, capacitive and elastoresistive sensors.","A tactile sensor is a type of sensor that is designed to detect physical touch or pressure. It can be used to measure the force applied to an object, as well as the position and movement of that object.

"Please explain what is ""Noam Chomsky""","Avram Noam Chomsky[a] (born December 7, 1928) is an American public intellectual: a linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian,[b] social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called ""the father of modern linguistics"",[c] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He is a Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and an Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and is the author of more than 150 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.
Born to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.
An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his anti-war essay ""The Responsibility of Intellectuals"". Becoming associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's list of political opponents. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent, and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of unconditional freedom of speech, including that of Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from active teaching at MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.
One of the most cited scholars alive,[d] Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, contemporary state capitalism, U.S. involvement and Israel's role in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media.

"Please explain what is ""Go (game)""","Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.
The playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other, black. The players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections (points) of a board. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones) is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, in which case the stone or group is captured. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move. When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). Games may also be terminated by resignation.
The standard Go board has a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. However, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard by the time the game reached Korea in the 5th century CE and Japan in the 7th century CE.
Go was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity. The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal Zuo Zhuan[10] (c. 4th century BCE).[11]
Despite its relatively simple rules, Go is extremely complex. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately 2.1×10170,[12][a] which is vastly greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, estimated to be of the order of 1080.[14]","Go is a board game that originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. It is played on a grid of 19 by 19 lines, with each player starting with an initial allotment of stones of their color (black or white). The goal of the game is to surround a larger total area of the board with your stones than your opponent does with theirs. Players take turns placing their stones on the intersections of the lines on the board, and the game ends when both players pass, indicating that they do not wish to make any more moves.



The game is known for its simple rules, but deep strategy and complexity. It is particularly popular in East Asia, and is played professionally in countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. Go has also gained a following in other parts of the world, and international tournaments are held regularly. The game is widely recognized for the unique challenges it presents to players and for the mental discipline and concentration it requires.",,wiki_csai,18313

The distinction between these last two classes is not consistently made; Jebara (2004) refers to these three classes as generative learning, conditional learning, and discriminative learning, but Ng & Jordan (2002) only distinguish two classes, calling them generative classifiers (joint distribution) and discriminative classifiers (conditional distribution or no distribution), not distinguishing between the latter two classes. Analogously, a classifier based on a generative model is a generative classifier, while a classifier based on a discriminative model is a discriminative classifier, though this term also refers to classifiers that are not based on a model.
Standard examples of each, all of which are linear classifiers, are:
In application to classification, one wishes to go from an observation x to a label y (or probability distribution on labels). One can compute this directly, without using a probability distribution (distribution-free classifier); one can estimate the probability of a label given an observation, 



P

X

)


{\displaystyle P(Y|X=x)}

 (discriminative model), and base classification on that; or one can estimate the joint distribution

{\displaystyle P(X,Y)}

 (generative model), from that compute the conditional probability 



P

{\displaystyle P(Y|X=x)}

, and then base classification on that. These are increasingly indirect, but increasingly probabilistic, allowing more domain knowledge and probability theory to be applied. In practice different approaches are used, depending on the particular problem, and hybrids can combine strengths of multiple approaches.","A generative model is a type of machine learning model that is capable of generating new, synthetic data samples that are similar to a training dataset. These models are used to learn the underlying structure and distribution of a dataset, and then use this learned structure to generate new, previously unseen data samples.



There are several types of generative models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and normalizing flow models. These models use different techniques to learn the underlying distribution of a dataset and generate new samples, but they all share the goal of being able to create synthetic data that is similar to the training data.



Generative models have a wide range of applications, including image synthesis, natural language processing, and audio generation. They can be used to create new data for a variety of purposes, such as data augmentation, data generation for unbalanced datasets, and the generation of synthetic data for testing and validation.",,wiki_csai,18574
"Please explain what is ""Description logic""","Description logics (DL) are a family of formal knowledge representation languages. Many DLs are more expressive than propositional logic but less expressive than first-order logic. In contrast to the latter, the core reasoning problems for DLs are (usually) decidable, and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy description logics, and each description logic features a different balance between expressive power and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.
DLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as terminological knowledge). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web: the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and its profiles are based on DLs. The most notable application of DLs and OWL is in biomedical informatics where DL assists in the codification of biomedical knowledge.[citation needed]","Description logic (DL) is a family of formal knowledge representation languages that can be used to represent the concepts and relationships in a domain of interest. DLs are used to formally describe the concepts, individuals, and relationships that make up a domain, and to reason about the properties and relationships of those concepts.



In DL, a concept is represented by a set of individuals (also called ""instances"") that have a certain set of properties. For example, the concept ""dog"" might be represented by a set of individuals that are all dogs, and have properties such as ""has four legs"" and ""barks"". DLs also allow the definition of complex concepts using logical operators, such as ""and"", ""or"", and ""not"". For example, the concept ""small dog"" might be defined as a dog that is both small and weighs less than 20 pounds.



DLs also allow the definition of relationships between concepts. For example, the relationship ""is a parent of"" might be defined between the concepts ""person"" and ""child"". This allows DLs to represent hierarchical relationships between concepts, such as the fact that a ""poodle"" is a type of ""dog"", which is a type of ""mammal"".



DLs are used in a variety of applications, including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and information retrieval. They are particularly useful for representing and reasoning about complex domains with many interrelated concepts, such as biology or the legal system.",,wiki_csai,18427
"Please explain what is ""Digital image processing""","Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems. The generation and development of digital image processing are mainly affected by three factors: first, the development of computers; second, the development of mathematics (especially the creation and improvement of discrete mathematics theory); third, the demand for a wide range of applications in environment, agriculture, military, industry and medical science has increased.","Digital image processing is a field of study that involves processing digital images using computer algorithms. It involves applying a series of mathematical operations to an image in order to improve its quality, extract information from it, or modify it in some way.



There are many different techniques used in digital image processing, including image enhancement, image restoration, image segmentation, image recognition, and image compression. These techniques can be used to improve the visual quality of an image, extract features or objects from the image, or analyze the image for a particular purpose.



Image enhancement techniques are used to improve the visual quality of an image by making it more visually appealing or easier to view. This can be done through techniques such as contrast stretching, which increases the range of intensity values in the image, or sharpening, which increases the detail in the image.



Image restoration techniques are used to remove noise or other distortions from an image, such as blur or scratches. These techniques can help to improve the clarity and detail of an image.



Image segmentation techniques are used to divide an image into distinct regions or segments, each of which corresponds to a different object or background in the image. This can be useful for identifying and extracting specific objects from the image.



Image recognition techniques are used to analyze an image and identify the objects or features present in it. This can be done through techniques such as pattern matching or machine learning algorithms.



Image compression techniques are used to reduce the size of an image file, making it easier to store or transmit. This is often done through techniques such as lossy compression, which reduces the size of the file by discarding some of the information in the image.



Digital image processing has a wide range of applications, including medical imaging, satellite imagery, video surveillance, and facial recognition. It is an important field in computer science and is constantly evolving with the development of new algorithms and technologies.",,wiki_csai,18859

Such art can be an image, sound, animation, video, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, video game, website, algorithm, performance or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating digital technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers has been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional painting with algorithm art and other digital techniques.   As a result, defining computer art by its end product can thus be difficult.  Computer art is bound to change over time since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible.","Computer art is a term used to describe any form of digital art or digital media that is created using computer software and hardware.

"Please explain what is ""Fifth generation computer""","The Fifth Generation Computer Systems  (FGCS) was a 10-year initiative begun in 1982 by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to create computers using massively parallel computing and logic programming. It aimed to create an ""epoch-making computer"" with supercomputer-like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in artificial intelligence. FGCS was ahead of its time and a commercial failure. FGCS contributed greatly to the field of concurrent logic programming.
The term ""fifth generation"" was intended to convey the system as being advanced. In the history of computing hardware, computers using vacuum tubes were called the first generation; transistors and diodes, the second; integrated circuits, the third; and those using microprocessors, the fourth. Whereas previous computer generations had focused on increasing the number of logic elements in a single CPU, the fifth generation, it was widely believed at the time, would instead turn to massive numbers of CPUs for added performance.","Fifth generation computers, also known as 5G computers, refer to a class of computers that were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s with the goal of creating intelligent machines that could perform tasks that normally require human-level intelligence. These computers were intended to be able to reason, learn, and adapt to new situations in a way that is similar to how humans think and solve problems.



Fifth generation computers were characterized by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as expert systems, natural language processing, and machine learning, to enable them to perform tasks that require a high degree of knowledge and decision-making ability. They were also designed to be highly parallel, meaning that they could perform many tasks at the same time, and to be able to handle large amounts of data efficiently.



Some examples of fifth generation computers include the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) project, which was a research project funded by the Japanese government in the 1980s to develop advanced AI-based computer systems, and the IBM Deep Blue computer, which was a fifth generation computer that was able to defeat the world chess champion in 1997.

"Please explain what is ""Navier–Stokes equations""","In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations (/nævˈjeɪ stoʊks/ nav-YAY STOHKS) are partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes.  They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842–1850 (Stokes).
The Navier–Stokes equations mathematically express conservation of momentum and conservation of mass for Newtonian fluids. They are sometimes accompanied by an equation of state relating pressure, temperature  and density. They arise from applying Isaac Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term—hence describing viscous flow. The difference between them and the closely related Euler equations is that Navier–Stokes equations take viscosity into account while the Euler equations model only inviscid flow. As a result, the Navier–Stokes are a parabolic equation and therefore have better analytic properties, at the expense of having less mathematical structure (e.g. they are never completely integrable).
The Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. The Navier–Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with Maxwell's equations, they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.
The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether smooth solutions always exist in three dimensions—i.e., whether they are infinitely differentiable (or even just bounded) at all points in the domain. This is called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US$1 million prize for a solution or a counterexample.","The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of mathematical equations that describe the motion of fluids, such as gases and liquids. They are named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish scientist George Gabriel Stokes.



The equations describe how the velocity, pressure, and other properties of a fluid are related and how they change over time. They are used to predict the behavior of fluids in a wide range of applications, including aerodynamics, meteorology, and the design of airplane wings and engines, as well as the flow of blood in the human body and the behavior of oceans and rivers.



The Navier-Stokes equations are based on the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. They take the form of a set of coupled partial differential equations that must be solved simultaneously in order to accurately predict the motion of a fluid.



Solving the Navier-Stokes equations is a challenging task, and it is an active area of research in mathematics and engineering. Despite their widespread use and importance, there are still many aspects of fluid dynamics that are not fully understood and that remain the subject of ongoing research.",,wiki_csai,18667
"Please explain what is ""Frequency comb""","In optics, a frequency comb is a laser source whose spectrum consists of a series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines. Frequency combs can be generated by a number of mechanisms, including periodic modulation (in amplitude and/or phase) of a continuous-wave laser, four-wave mixing in nonlinear media, or stabilization of the pulse train generated by a mode-locked laser. Much work has been devoted to this last mechanism, which was developed around the turn of the 21st century and ultimately led to one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics being shared by John L. Hall and Theodor W. Hänsch in 2005.

The spacing between the frequencies is called the comb spacing, and it is typically on the order of a few megahertz or gigahertz. The name ""frequency comb"" comes from the fact that the spectrum of frequencies generated by the device looks like the teeth of a comb when plotted on a frequency axis.



Frequency combs are important tools in a variety of scientific and technological applications. They are used, for example, in precision spectroscopy, metrology, and telecommunications. They can also be used to generate ultra-short optical pulses, which have many applications in fields such as nonlinear optics and precision measurement.



There are several different ways to generate a frequency comb, but one of the most common methods is to use a mode-locked laser. Mode-locking is a technique in which the laser cavity is actively stabilized, resulting in the emission of a series of very short, equally spaced pulses of light. The spectrum of each pulse is a frequency comb, with the comb spacing determined by the repetition rate of the pulses. Other methods for generating frequency combs include electro-optic modulators, nonlinear optical processes, and microresonator systems.",,wiki_csai,18645
"Please explain what is ""Psychedelic art""","Psychedelic art (also known as psychedelia) is art, graphics or visual displays related to or inspired by psychedelic experiences and hallucinations known to follow the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, and DMT. The word ""psychedelic"" (coined by British psychologist Humphry Osmond) means ""mind manifesting"".  By that definition, all artistic efforts to depict the inner world of the psyche may be considered ""psychedelic"".
In common parlance ""psychedelic art"" refers above all to the art movement of the late 1960s counterculture, featuring highly distorted or surreal visuals, bright colors and full spectrums and animation (including cartoons) to evoke, convey, or enhance psychedelic experiences. Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to psychedelic rock music.  Concert posters, album covers, liquid light shows, liquid light art, murals, comic books, underground newspapers and more reflected not only the kaleidoscopically swirling colour patterns of LSD hallucinations,  but also revolutionary political, social and spiritual sentiments inspired by insights derived from these psychedelic states of consciousness.","Psychedelic art is a form of visual art that is characterized by the use of bright, vibrant colors and swirling, abstract patterns.

The goal of the Soar project is to develop the fixed computational building blocks necessary for general intelligent agents – agents that can perform a wide range of tasks and encode, use, and learn all types of knowledge to realize the full range of cognitive capabilities found in humans, such as decision making, problem solving, planning, and natural-language understanding. It is both a theory of what cognition is and a computational implementation of that theory. Since its beginnings in 1983 as John Laird’s thesis, it has been widely used by AI researchers to create intelligent agents and cognitive models of different aspects of human behavior.

Soar models human cognition at a high level of abstraction, including processes such as problem solving, decision making, and learning.



Soar represents knowledge in a hierarchical structure called a ""production system,"" which consists of a set of ""rules"" that can be triggered by specific conditions. These rules can be thought of as if-then statements, with the ""if"" part being the condition and the ""then"" part being the action that is taken. When a rule is triggered, it can execute a sequence of actions and also modify the current state of the system.

The United States Congress is the legislature of the federal government of the United States. It is bicameral, composed of a lower body, the House of Representatives, and an upper body, the Senate. It meets in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The U.S. vice president has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members.
The sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present, beginning every other January. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 establishes that there be 435 representatives and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the Congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one Congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states.
Article One of the U.S. Constitution requires that members of Congress must be at least 25 years old (House) or at least 30 years old (Senate), have been a citizen of the U.S. for seven (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the state which they represent. Members in both chambers may stand for re-election an unlimited number of times.
The Congress was created by the U.S. Constitution and first met in 1789, replacing the Congress of the Confederation in its legislative function. Although not legally mandated, in practice since the 19th century, Congress members are typically affiliated with one of the two major parties, the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, and only rarely with a third party or independents affiliated with no party. In the case of the latter, the lack of affiliation with a political party does not mean that such members are unable to caucus with members of the political parties. Members can also switch parties at any time, although this is quite uncommon.","The United States Congress is the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the United States, composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

"Please explain what is ""Infrared light""","Infrared (IR), sometimes called infrared light, is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with wavelengths longer than those of visible light. It is therefore invisible to the human eye. IR is generally understood to encompass wavelengths from around 1 millimeter (300 GHz) to the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum, around 700 nanometers (430 THz).[verification needed] Longer IR wavelengths (30 μm-100 μm) are sometimes included as part of the terahertz radiation range. Almost all black-body radiation from objects near room temperature is at infrared wavelengths. As a form of electromagnetic radiation, IR propagates energy and momentum, exerts radiation pressure, and has properties corresponding to both those of a wave and of a particle, the photon.
It was long known that fires emit invisible heat; in 1681 the pioneering experimenter Edme Mariotte showed that glass, though transparent to sunlight, obstructed radiant heat. In 1800 the astronomer Sir William Herschel discovered that infrared radiation is a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light, by means of its effect on a thermometer. Slightly more than half of the energy from the Sun was eventually found, through Herschel's studies, to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared. The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has an important effect on Earth's climate.
Infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when changing rotational-vibrational movements. It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment, making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry. Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range.
Infrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, military, commercial, and medical applications. Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds, to detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe. Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect the overheating of electrical components.
Military and civilian applications include target acquisition, surveillance, night vision, homing, and tracking. Humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10 μm (micrometers). Non-military uses include thermal efficiency analysis, environmental monitoring, industrial facility inspections, detection of grow-ops, remote temperature sensing, short-range wireless communication, spectroscopy, and weather forecasting.","Infrared light is a type of electromagnetic radiation that has a longer wavelength and lower frequency than visible light. It is not visible to the human eye, but it can be detected by some animals, such as snakes and insects, as well as by special sensors called infrared detectors.



Infrared light is divided into three main categories: near-infrared, mid-infrared, and far-infrared. Near-infrared has the shortest wavelengths and is the closest to visible light, while far-infrared has the longest wavelengths and the lowest frequency.



Infrared light has a number of practical applications, including:



Heating: Far-infrared light can be used to generate heat, and is used in some types of heating lamps and saunas.

Communication: Infrared light is used in some types of communication, such as TV remote controls and certain types of wireless networking.

Night vision: Infrared light can be used to enhance night vision, and is used in some types of night-vision goggles and cameras.

Other examples of nonparametric statistical tests include the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.



Nonparametric statistical methods are often used in fields such as psychology, biology, and economics, where the data may not meet the assumptions of parametric tests. They can also be useful in cases where the sample size is small, or when the data are ordinal rather than continuous. Nonparametric statistical tests are generally less powerful than parametric tests, meaning that they may be less able to detect differences between groups of data, but they are still useful in a wide variety of situations.",,wiki_csai,18842
"Please explain what is ""Herman Hollerith""","Herman Hollerith (February 29, 1860 – November 17, 1929) was a German-American statistician, inventor, and businessman who developed an electromechanical tabulating machine for punched cards to assist in summarizing information and, later, in accounting. His invention of the punched card tabulating machine, patented in 1884, marks the beginning of the era of mechanized binary code and semiautomatic data processing systems, and his concept dominated that landscape for nearly a century.
Hollerith founded a company that was amalgamated in 1911 with several other companies to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. In 1924, the company was renamed ""International Business Machines"" (IBM) and became one of the largest and most successful companies of the 20th century. Hollerith is regarded as one of the seminal figures in the development of data processing.","Herman Hollerith was an American inventor and businessman who is credited with the development of the first successful electromechanical punched card tabulator for use in data processing. He was born in Buffalo, New York in 1860 and received a degree in engineering from the Columbia School of Mines in 1879.



In the 1880s, Hollerith began working on a system to process and analyze data using punched cards. His system was initially used to process data for the U.S. Census, and it proved to be much faster and more efficient than the manual methods that had previously been used. Hollerith's system used punched cards as a means of storing and organizing data, and a machine called a tabulator to read and process the cards. The tabulator could perform various mathematical calculations and sort the data according to specified criteria.



Hollerith's system was so successful that he formed the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896 to manufacture and sell his punched card equipment. The company later merged with several other companies to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), which was renamed to International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924. Hollerith served as the president of CTR until 1911, and he continued to work for the company as a consultant until his death in 1929.",,wiki_csai,19049

"Please explain what is ""Ant colony optimization""","In computer science and operations research, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. 
The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.   Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.
As an example, ant colony optimization  is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony.  Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions.  Real ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.  The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.  One variation on this approach is the bees algorithm, which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the honey bee, another social insect.
This algorithm is a member of the ant colony algorithms family, in swarm intelligence methods, and it constitutes some metaheuristic optimizations. Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 in his PhD thesis, the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a source of food. The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants. From a broader perspective, ACO performs a model-based search and shares some similarities with estimation of distribution algorithms.","Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a heuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the behavior of ant colonies. Ant colonies are able to solve complex problems, such as finding the shortest path between their nest and a food source, by using simple rules and communication through pheromone trails. ACO algorithms use a similar process to find approximate solutions to optimization problems.



In ACO, a set of artificial ants is used to search for good solutions to the problem. Each ant builds a solution by constructing a path through a graph, with the quality of the solution being determined by the cost of the path. The ants communicate with each other through pheromone trails, which are used to indicate the desirability of different paths.



As the ants search for solutions, they leave pheromone trails on the paths they take. These trails serve as a kind of ""memory"" for the ants, allowing them to remember which paths are good and which are not. Over time, the pheromone trails on the most desirable paths become stronger, while the trails on less desirable paths fade away. This process allows the ants to adapt their search strategies as they learn more about the problem.



ACO algorithms have been applied to a wide range of optimization problems, including scheduling, routing, and resource allocation. They are particularly well suited to problems that involve finding the shortest path through a large, complex graph.",,wiki_csai,18415
"Please explain what is ""Feature engineering""","Feature engineering or feature extraction  or feature discovery is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw data.  The motivation is to use these extra features to improve the quality of results from a machine learning process, compared with supplying only the raw data to the machine learning process.","Feature engineering is the process of designing and creating features for machine learning models. These features are inputs for the model, and they represent the different characteristics or attributes of the data being used to train the model.



The goal of feature engineering is to extract the most relevant and useful information from the raw data and to transform it into a form that can be easily used by machine learning algorithms. This process involves selecting and combining different pieces of data, as well as applying various transformations and techniques to extract the most useful features.



Effective feature engineering can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models, as it helps to identify the most important factors that influence the outcome of the model and to eliminate noise or irrelevant data. It is an important part of the machine learning workflow, and it requires a deep understanding of the data and the problem being solved.",,wiki_csai,18578
"Please explain what is ""Upper ontology""","In information science, an  upper ontology (also known as a top-level ontology, upper model, or foundation ontology) is an ontology (in the sense used in information science) which consists of very general terms (such as ""object"", ""property"", ""relation"") that are common across all domains.  An important function of an upper ontology is to support broad semantic interoperability among a large number of domain-specific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions. Terms in the domain ontology are ranked under the terms in the upper ontology, e.g., the upper ontology classes are superclasses or supersets of all the classes in the domain ontologies.
A number of upper ontologies have been proposed, each with its own proponents.
Library classification systems predate upper ontology systems. Though library classifications organize and categorize knowledge using general concepts that are the same across all knowledge domains, neither system is a replacement for the other.","In the field of information science and computer science, an upper ontology is a formal vocabulary that provides a common set of concepts and categories for representing knowledge within a domain. It is designed to be general enough to be applicable across a wide range of domains, and serves as a foundation for more specific domain ontologies. Upper ontologies are often used as a starting point for building domain ontologies, which are more specific to a particular subject area or application.



The purpose of an upper ontology is to provide a common language that can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in a given domain. It is intended to provide a set of general concepts that can be used to classify and organize the more specific concepts and categories used in a domain ontology. An upper ontology can help to reduce the complexity and ambiguity of a domain by providing a shared, standardized vocabulary that can be used to describe the concepts and relationships within that domain.



Upper ontologies are often developed using formal methods, such as first-order logic, and may be implemented using a variety of technologies, including ontology languages like OWL or RDF. They can be used in a variety of applications, including knowledge management, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.",,wiki_csai,18359
"Please explain what is ""Expert system""","In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system emulating the decision-making ability of a human expert.
Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software. 
An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.","An expert system is a computer program that is designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a particular field. Expert systems are based on the idea of artificial intelligence and are designed to replicate the expertise of a human expert by using a combination of computer software and data.



Expert systems use a set of rules or a decision tree to make decisions and solve problems. These rules are based on the knowledge and experience of an expert in a particular field, and are stored in a computer program. The expert system uses these rules to analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions or recommendations.



Expert systems are used in a variety of fields, including medicine, engineering, and finance, to help make decisions and solve problems more efficiently. They can be used to diagnose medical conditions, design engineering solutions, or make investment recommendations, for example.

"Please explain what is ""Self-driving cars""","A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous car, driver-less car, or robotic car (robo-car), is a car that is capable of traveling without human input. Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. Control systems interpret sensory information to create a three-dimensional model of the surroundings. Based on the model, the car identifies appropriate navigation paths, and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs, etc.) and obstacles.[10][11]
Once the technology matures, autonomous vehicles are predicted to impact the automobile industry, health, welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market and other fields. 
Autonomy in vehicles is often divided into six levels,[12] according to a system developed by SAE International (SAE J3016).[13] The SAE levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 – no automation; Level 1 – hands on/shared control; Level 2 – hands off; Level 3 – eyes off; Level 4 – mind off, and Level 5 – steering wheel optional.
As of December 2022[update], vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor. In December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona. In March 2021, Honda was the first manufacturer to sell a legally approved Level 3 car.[14][15][16] Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[17] In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz received approval for a Level 3 car.[18] In February 2022, Cruise became the second service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in San Francisco.[19]

"Please explain what is ""Lisp (programming language)""","Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.
Originally specified in 1960, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use, after Fortran. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme, Racket and Clojure.
Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by (though not originally derived from) the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became a favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research.[10] As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler,[11] and the read–eval–print loop.[12]
The name LISP derives from ""LISt Processor"".[13] Linked lists are one of Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.
The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax. All program code is written as s-expressions, or parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a list with the function or operator's name first, and the arguments following; for instance, a function f that takes three arguments would be called as (f arg1 arg2 arg3).","Lisp (short for ""List Processing Language"") is a family of programming languages that are known for their use of lists as a fundamental data type and their ability to treat code as data. Lisp was one of the earliest programming languages, with its origins dating back to the late 1950s.



Lisp is a dynamically typed, homoiconic programming language, which means that the source code and data are both represented as lists in the language itself. This makes it easy to manipulate code using the same constructs that are used to manipulate data, and it also allows Lisp programs to be very concise and expressive.



Lisp has a long history of use in artificial intelligence (AI) research and has influenced the design of many other programming languages. It is still in use today, although it is not as popular as some other programming languages. Lisp is often used for projects that require a high degree of flexibility, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and symbolic computing.",,wiki_csai,18458

"Please explain what is ""Artificial brain""","An artificial brain (or artificial mind) is software and hardware with cognitive abilities similar to those of the animal or human brain.
Research investigating ""artificial brains"" and brain emulation plays three important roles in science:
An example of the first objective is the project reported by Aston University in Birmingham, England where researchers are using biological cells to create ""neurospheres"" (small clusters of neurons) in order to develop new treatments for diseases including Alzheimer's, motor neurone and Parkinson's disease.
The second objective is a reply to arguments such as John Searle's Chinese room argument, Hubert Dreyfus's critique of AI or Roger Penrose's argument in The Emperor's New Mind. These critics argued that there are aspects of human consciousness or expertise that can not be simulated by machines. One reply to their arguments is that the biological processes inside the brain can be simulated to any degree of accuracy. This reply was made as early as 1950, by Alan Turing in his classic paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"".[note 1]
The third objective is generally called artificial general intelligence by researchers. However, Ray Kurzweil prefers the term ""strong AI"". In his book The Singularity is Near, he focuses on whole brain emulation using conventional computing machines as an approach to implementing artificial brains, and claims (on grounds of computer power continuing an exponential growth trend) that this could be done by 2025. Henry Markram, director of the Blue Brain project (which is attempting brain emulation), made a similar claim (2020) at the Oxford TED conference in 2009.","An artificial brain is a hypothetical construct that attempts to replicate the functions of the human brain in a machine. It is a term that is often used to describe various artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are designed to mimic the cognitive functions of the human brain, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception.



There are many different approaches to creating an artificial brain, and the term is often used in a general sense to refer to any type of advanced AI system that is designed to simulate human-like intelligence. Some of the key technologies that are being developed in this area include machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and natural language processing (NLP) systems.



While the concept of an artificial brain is still largely theoretical, there have been significant advances in AI in recent years that have brought us closer to achieving this goal. It is believed that an artificial brain could have a wide range of applications, including in robotics, healthcare, and education. However, it is also important to consider the ethical implications of creating an artificial intelligence that is capable of human-like cognition.",,wiki_csai,18391
"Please explain what is ""Sensitivity and specificity""","Sensitivity and specificity mathematically describe the accuracy of a test which reports the presence or absence of a condition. Individuals for which the condition is satisfied are considered ""positive"" and those for which it is not are considered ""negative"".
If the true condition can not be known, a ""gold standard test"" is assumed to be correct. In a diagnostic test, sensitivity is a measure of how well a test can identify true positives and specificity is a measure of how well a test can identify true negatives. For all testing, both diagnostic and screening, there is usually a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, such that higher sensitivities will mean lower specificities and vice versa.
If the goal is to return the ratio at which the test identifies the percentage of people highly likely to be identified as having the condition, the number of true positives should be high and the number of false negatives should be very low, which results in high sensitivity. This is especially important when the consequence of failing to treat the condition is serious and/or the treatment is very effective and has minimal side effects.
If the goal is to return the ratio at which the test identifies the percentage of people highly likely to be identified as not having the condition, the number of true negatives should be high and the number of false positives should be very low, which results in high specificity. That is, people highly likely to be excluded by the test. This is especially important when people who are identified as having a condition may be subjected to more testing, expense, stigma, anxiety, etc.
The terms ""sensitivity"" and ""specificity"" were introduced by American biostatistician Jacob Yerushalmy in 1947.","In medical testing, sensitivity and specificity are two important measures that are used to evaluate the performance of a diagnostic test.



Sensitivity refers to the proportion of positive cases that are correctly identified by the test. In other words, it is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who have the disease or condition. A test with high sensitivity will correctly identify most people with the disease, while a test with low sensitivity will miss many cases of the disease.



Specificity, on the other hand, refers to the proportion of negative cases that are correctly identified by the test. It is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who do not have the disease. A test with high specificity will correctly identify most people who do not have the disease, while a test with low specificity will incorrectly identify many people as having the disease when they do not.



Both sensitivity and specificity are important characteristics of a diagnostic test, as a test with high sensitivity will accurately identify most cases of the disease, while a test with high specificity will accurately rule out most cases where the disease is not present. A test with both high sensitivity and specificity is considered to be a reliable and accurate diagnostic tool.",,wiki_csai,18813

(AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Often times, clients will use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a client to use more compute in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IOT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms.  This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. 
One of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console.  AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).
AWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a ""Pay-as-you-go"" model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions including seven in North America.
Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[10] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways.

As in human children, learning is expected to be cumulative and of progressively increasing complexity, and to result from self-exploration of the world in combination with social interaction. The typical methodological approach consists in starting from theories of human and animal development elaborated in fields such as developmental psychology, neuroscience, developmental and evolutionary biology, and linguistics, then to formalize and implement them in robots, sometimes exploring extensions or variants of them. The experimentation of those models in robots allows researchers to confront them with reality, and as a consequence, developmental robotics also provides feedback and novel hypotheses on theories of human and animal development.

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.
The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multi-dimensional data from a 3D scanner, or medical scanning devices. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.
Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, 3D scene modeling, and image restoration.","Computer vision is the field of artificial intelligence that deals with the creation of algorithms and systems that can analyze, understand, and interpret visual data from the world. It involves the development of algorithms and models that can process images and video and extract meaningful information from them.



Some of the tasks that are commonly tackled in computer vision include image classification, object detection and tracking, image segmentation, image restoration and enhancement, and image generation. These tasks require the development of algorithms and models that can analyze visual data and make decisions based on that data.



Computer vision has a wide range of applications, including autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, security and surveillance, and robotics. It is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize many industries and has already had a significant impact on a variety of fields.",,wiki_csai,18455

"Please explain what is ""Data warehouse""","In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is considered a core component of business intelligence. DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They store current and historical data in one single place that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise.
The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational systems (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an operational data store and may require data cleansing for additional operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the DW for reporting.
Extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT) are the two main approaches used to build a data warehouse system.","A data warehouse is a central repository of data that is used for reporting and data analysis. It is designed to support the efficient querying and analysis of data by end users and analysts.



A data warehouse typically stores data from a variety of sources, including transactional databases, log files, and other operational systems. The data is extracted from these sources, transformed and cleaned to fit the data warehouse's schema, and then loaded into the data warehouse for reporting and analysis.



Data warehouses are designed to be fast, efficient, and scalable, so that they can handle the large amounts of data and concurrent users that are common in business and analytical applications. They also support the use of specialized analytical tools and techniques, such as OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and data mining, which allow users to explore and analyze data in new and powerful ways.



Overall, data warehouses are an important tool for businesses, organizations, and analysts, as they allow them to gain insights and make informed decisions based on data.",,wiki_csai,18923
"Please explain what is ""Philip K. Dick""","Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 – March 2, 1982) was an American science fiction writer. He wrote 44 novels and about 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime. His fiction explored varied philosophical and social questions such as the nature of reality, perception, human nature, and identity, and commonly featured characters struggling against elements such as alternate realities, illusory environments, monopolistic corporations, drug abuse, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness.
Born in Chicago, Dick moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family at a young age. He began publishing science fiction stories in 1952, at age 23. He found little commercial success until his alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle (1962) earned him acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel, when he was 33. He followed with science fiction novels such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Ubik (1969). His 1974 novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.
Following years of drug abuse and a series of mystical experiences in 1974, Dick's work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, metaphysics, and the nature of reality, as in novels A Scanner Darkly (1977), VALIS (1981), and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer (1982). A collection of his speculative nonfiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick (2011). He died in 1982 in Santa Ana, California, at the age of 53, due to complications from a stroke. Following his death, he became ""widely regarded as a master of imaginative, paranoid fiction in the vein of Franz Kafka and Thomas Pynchon"".[10]
Dick's posthumous influence has been widespread, extending beyond literary circles into Hollywood filmmaking.[11] Popular films based on his works include  Blade Runner (1982), Total Recall (adapted twice: in 1990 and in 2012), Screamers (1995), Minority Report (2002), A Scanner Darkly (2006), The Adjustment Bureau (2011), and Radio Free Albemuth (2010). Beginning in 2015, Amazon Prime Video produced the multi-season television adaptation The Man in the High Castle, based on Dick's 1962 novel; and in 2017 Channel 4 began producing the ongoing anthology series Electric Dreams, based on various Dick stories.
In 2005, Time magazine named Ubik (1969) one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923.[12]  In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer included in The Library of America series.[13][14][15]","Philip K. Dick was a science fiction writer known for his thought-provoking and sometimes disturbing works that explore themes of reality, consciousness, and the nature of existence. He was born in 1928 in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in California. Dick began writing science fiction in the 1950s, and his work quickly gained a devoted following. He wrote more than 44 novels and 121 short stories during his career, many of which have been adapted for film, television, and other media.



Some of Dick's most famous works include ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", which was adapted into the film ""Blade Runner,"" and ""The Man in the High Castle,"" which was adapted into a television series of the same name. His writing is known for its use of the ""unreliable narrator,"" in which the reader is left to question the veracity of the story being told, and for its exploration of metaphysical and philosophical concepts.



Dick was a highly influential figure in the science fiction community, and his work has won numerous awards and accolades. He died in 1982, but his legacy lives on through his enduring and thought-provoking fiction.",,wiki_csai,18555
"Please explain what is ""3D reconstruction""","In computer vision and computer graphics, 3D reconstruction is the process of capturing the shape and appearance of real objects.
This process can be accomplished either by active or passive methods. If the model is allowed to change its shape in time, this is referred to as non-rigid or spatio-temporal reconstruction.","3D reconstruction is the process of creating a 3D model of an object or scene from a set of 2D images or point clouds. It involves the use of specialized software and algorithms to analyze the images or point clouds and generate a digital representation of the object or scene in three dimensions.



There are several different approaches to 3D reconstruction, including:



Photogrammetry: This approach involves the use of multiple photographs of an object or scene taken from different angles to generate a 3D model. The images are processed using specialized software that matches features between the images and triangulates the positions of these features in 3D space.



Structure from Motion (SfM): This approach involves the use of a series of images taken by a moving camera to generate a 3D model. The camera's motion is used to determine the position of each feature in the images in 3D space, and this information is used to reconstruct the object or scene.



LiDAR: This approach involves the use of a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor to measure the distance to various points on an object or scene. The resulting point cloud is used to reconstruct the object or scene in 3D.



3D reconstruction has many applications, including architecture, engineering, film and video game production, and robotics. It allows for the creation of detailed, accurate models of objects and scenes that can be used for analysis, visualization, and simulation.",,wiki_csai,18853
"Please explain what is ""Partial differential equation""","In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which imposes relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable function.
The function is often thought of as an ""unknown"" to be solved for, similarly to how x is thought of as an unknown number to be solved for in an algebraic equation like x2 − 3x + 2 = 0. However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. There is, correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative features of solutions of various partial differential equations, such as existence, uniqueness, regularity, and stability.[citation needed] Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000.
Partial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically oriented scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrödinger equation, Pauli equation, etc). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations, such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology.
Partly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different types of partial differential equations, and methods have been developed for dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is usually acknowledged that there is no ""general theory"" of partial differential equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several essentially distinct subfields.
Ordinary differential equations form a subclass of partial differential equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable. Stochastic partial differential equations and nonlocal equations are, as of 2020, particularly widely studied extensions of the ""PDE"" notion. More classical topics, on which there is still much active research, include elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, Boltzmann equations, and dispersive partial differential equations.","A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation that involves partial derivatives of a function with respect to two or more independent variables. PDEs are used to describe the behavior of many different physical systems, including fluid flow, heat transfer, and the vibration of structures.



An example of a partial differential equation is the heat equation, which describes how the temperature of a solid object changes over time. The heat equation is written as:



∂T/∂t = κ ∂^2T/∂x^2



Here, T is the temperature of the object at a given point in space and time, t is time, x is the position in space, and κ is a constant known as the thermal diffusivity. The partial derivative ∂T/∂t represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to time, and the second partial derivative ∂^2T/∂x^2 represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to space.



PDEs are used to model a wide range of phenomena, from the movement of fluids to the distribution of electricity in a circuit. They are an important tool in many areas of science and engineering, and are typically solved using numerical methods or analytical techniques.",,wiki_csai,18666
