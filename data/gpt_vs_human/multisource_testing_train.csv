When does it make sense for the money paid for equity to go to the corporation?,"[""If the check is written as a check to BigCo, it is less clear how Jack can compensate himself for the equity sale. It is as if the equity was owned by the corporation, not by Jack. This is correct.  If the check is written to BigCo, then it is BigCo issuing new shares.  Jack doesn't compensate himself for the equity sale, as he didn't sell anything.  The company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion.  In the long term, the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $200,000 no-interest loan to the company.   If the value of the company before investing $250,000 is $1 million, then the value after investing is $1.25 million.  So $250,000 is 20% of the value of the company.  BigCo should not give the buyer 25% of BigCo but only 20% in that example.  If it does give 25%, the buyer is getting a $312,500 stake for only $250,000.   With the other example, Jack sells 25% of the company for $250,000 from his personal shares.  This doesn't change the assessed value of the company, just Jack's stake.  Jack then loans the company $200,000.  This also doesn't change the assessed value of the company (at least in theory).  It gains $200,000 but has an offsetting debt of $200,000.  In net, that's no change.  Assets and liabilities balance the same.   So if you know that the assessed value of the company is $1 million and that the buyer is paying $250,000 for a 25% stake at that same valuation, then you know that the check is being written to Jack.  If the check is written to BigCo, then one or more of those numbers is incorrect.   The buyer could be getting a 20% stake.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1.25 million.   Or paying $333,333.33.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1,333,333.33.   Or BigCo could only be worth $750,000 before the investment.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1 million.   Or Jack is getting screwed, selling $312,500 in stock (25%) for only $250,000.  Jack's shares drop from being worth $1 million to only $937,500.  The value of the company is $1.25 million.   Or some combination of smaller changes that balances.""]","['When a corporation issues equity, it is essentially selling ownership stakes in the company to investors in the form of stocks. The money that is paid for the equity goes to the corporation and becomes part of its capital.There are several reasons why a corporation might choose to issue equity:To raise capital: A corporation can use the money it raises through the sale of equity to fund various business activities, such as expanding operations, investing in research and development, or paying off debt.To finance growth: A corporation may issue equity as a way to finance growth, particularly if it is unable to secure financing through other means, such as borrowing from a bank or issuing debt.To reward shareholders: A corporation may issue equity as a way to reward shareholders, either through a dividend or through the appreciation of the stock price.Overall, it makes sense for the money paid for equity to go to the corporation when it can be used to generate value for the company and its shareholders.']",,finance,20512
Is an interest-only mortgage a bad idea?,"['It seems you understand the risks, it seems like a fine enough idea.  Hopefully it works out for you. However, you may want to talk to a few local banks about getting a short term home equity loan.  I know someone who was able to do this getting a very low rate for 7 years.  At the time of the loan, the prevailing rate for a 15 year was 3.25, but they were able to get the HEL at 2.6 fixed.  There was no closing costs. The best part about it was the payment was not that much more.  While going from ~1200 to ~1800 is a 50% increase it was not that much in dollars in relationship to his household income.   Note that I did not say Home Equity Line of Credit, which are vairable rates and amount borrowed.']","['An interest-only mortgage can be a good option for some borrowers, but it is not suitable for everyone. An interest-only mortgage is a type of home loan in which the borrower only pays the interest on the loan each month, rather than paying both the principal and the interest. This means that the borrower does not make any progress on paying off the loan balance during the interest-only period.There are a few potential advantages to an interest-only mortgage. For example, the monthly payments may be lower during the interest-only period, which can be helpful for borrowers who are on a tight budget. Additionally, an interest-only mortgage can be a good option for borrowers who expect their income to increase significantly in the future, as they will be able to pay off the loan more quickly once the interest-only period ends.However, there are also a number of potential drawbacks to an interest-only mortgage. One of the biggest risks is that the borrower may end up paying more in the long run, as they will eventually have to start paying off the principal of the loan in addition to the interest. Additionally, if the value of the property decreases, the borrower may owe more on the loan than the property is worth. This could make it difficult to sell the property or refinance the loan.Overall, it is important for borrowers to carefully consider their financial situation and goals before deciding whether an interest-only mortgage is the right choice for them. It may be a good idea to speak with a financial advisor or a mortgage lender to get a better understanding of the potential risks and benefits of this type of loan.']",,finance,22700

Dad paying for my new home in cash. How can I buy the house from him?,"['There are quite some options, but without additional information, I can only provide examples. Last year I had the option to buy a house, but I decided against it because in my area it is getting harder and harder every year to sell it at a reasonable price. But if I had bought a house, my mother would have lent me the money, with me paying it back to her over the years on 3% interest. So it would have been some kind of a private loan. But my mom would never have taken ownership of the house, since it was not her intention to own it in any way. (Does your dad intend to own the house and rent it to you? If yes, and if you are comfortable with renting instead of buying, then this is an option.) The second option, the one we discarded because of the additional cost, is that I could have taken a loan, paying 4.5% interest to the bank, which would then pay under 1% to my mom, and keep the rest. Banks always want to make profit, and this profit has to come from somewhere - from the difference between the interest rates. If your dad has 230k on the bank, and you owe 230k to the bank, you are better off if you keep the bank out - at least as long as your dad is comfortable with lending you money, and you are comfortable with owing him money. (my gf would never borough money from her mother, because her mother would always play the ""you are in my debt"" card - on each and every visit, and whenever she needed help in any way...) So the key is: What does your dad feel comfy with - and what do you feel comfy with. If possible, keep the banks out, but set up a written contract between you and your dad.']","[""There are a few options you can consider if you want to buy a home that is being paid for in cash by your father. Here are a few options to consider:Purchase the home through a mortgage: One option is to take out a mortgage on the property and pay your father the purchase price in installments. This can be a good option if you have good credit and can qualify for a mortgage with a favorable interest rate.Use a land contract: Another option is to use a land contract, also known as a contract for deed. With a land contract, you would make payments to your father over time, and he would hold the title to the property until the final payment is made. Once the final payment is made, the title would be transferred to you.Use a promissory note: You could also use a promissory note to document the terms of the sale. A promissory note is a written promise to pay a certain amount of money at a specific time or on demand. You could use a promissory note to outline the terms of the sale, including the purchase price, the payment schedule, and any late payment fees.Regardless of which option you choose, it is important to have a written agreement in place to document the terms of the sale and protect both you and your father's interests. It may also be a good idea to consult with an attorney to ensure that the agreement is legally enforceable.""]",,finance,19747
Can I rely on my home equity to finance large home repairs?,"['Yes, a HELOC is great for that. I just had my roof done last month (~$15K, ""ugh"") and pretty much every major contractor in my area had a 0% same-as-cash for at least 12 months.

The loan is typically paid back over a fixed period of time, with equal monthly payments that include both principal and interest.A HELOC is a type of loan that allows you to borrow against your home equity as needed. With a HELOC, you are approved for a certain amount of credit, and you can borrow against that credit as needed, up to the credit limit. You are only required to make payments on the amount that you borrow, and you can borrow and repay the funds as needed over the life of the loan.Both home equity loans and HELOCs can be used to finance large home repairs, such as replacing a roof or updating a kitchen.

Why there's always a very huge volume of trades for AAPL every day before market close?,"['A huge amount of money in all financial markets is from institutional investors, such as mutual funds, government pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, etc.  For various reasons these funds do all of their trading at the end of the day.  They care primarily that their end-of-day balances are in line with their targets and are easy to audit and far less about ""timing the market"" for the best possible trades. So, if you\'re looking at a stock that is owned by many institutional investors -- such as a stock (like AAPL) that makes up a significant portion of an index that many funds track -- there will be a huge amount of activity at this time relative to stocks that are less popular among institutions. Even just in its introduction this paper (PDF) gives a fair overview of other reasons why there\'s a lot of trading at end-of-day in general. (In fact, because of all this closing activity and the reliance on end-of-day prices as signposts for financial calculations, the end-of-day has for decades been the single most fraud-ridden time of the trading day.  Electronic trading has done away with a lot of the straight-up thievery that floor traders and brokers used to get away with at the expense of the public, but it still exists.  See, for example, any explanation of the term banging the close, or the penalties against 6 banks just last month for manipulating the FX market at the close.)']","['There are several reasons why there may be a large volume of trades for a particular stock, such as Apple (AAPL), at the end of the trading day. One reason may be that traders and investors are trying to close out their positions before the market closes for the day. This can be especially true if the market has been volatile or if there are concerns about potential market-moving news or events that may occur after the market closes. Additionally, the end of the trading day is often when mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional investors reconcile their positions and make any necessary trades to align their portfolios with their investment strategies. This can also contribute to increased trading volume at the end of the day. Finally, it is also common for traders and investors to engage in what is known as ""end-of-day"" trading, which involves buying or selling a stock at the close of the market in order to benefit from any changes in the stock\'s price that may occur after the market closes.', ""There are a number of possible reasons why there may be a large volume of trades for a particular stock, such as Apple (AAPL), at the close of the market.

For example, if a company is set to report earnings after the market closes and there is expected to be a significant impact on the stock's price, traders may want to adjust their positions before the earnings announcement.Another reason for increased trading volume at the close of the market could be related to the way that certain investment strategies are implemented. For example, some investment strategies may involve buying or selling a large volume of a particular stock at the close of the market in order to take advantage of price movements that may occur overnight or over the weekend.Finally, it is also possible that the increased volume of trades at the close of the market could be related to the overall level of market activity at that time. As the market approaches the close of trading, there may be more traders and investors looking to adjust their positions or to close out their trades for the day, which could result in increased trading volume.""]",,finance,20586
New business owner - How do taxes work for the business vs individual?,"[""Through your question and then clarification through the comments, it looks like you have a U.S. LLC with at least two members.  If you did not elect some other tax treatment, your LLC will be treated as a partnership by the IRS.  The partnership should file a tax return on Form 1065.  Then each partner will get a Schedule K-1 from the partnership, which the partner should use to include their respective shares of the partnership income and expenses on their personal Forms 1040. You can also elect to be taxed as an S-Corp or a C-Corp instead of a partnership, but that requires you to file a form explicitly making such election.  If you go S-Corp, then you will file a different form for the company, but the procedure is roughly the same - Income gets passed through to the owners via a Schedule K-1.  If you go C-Corp, then the owners will pay no tax on their own Form 1040, but the C-Corp itself will pay income tax. As far as whether you should try to spend the money as business expense to avoid paying extra tax - That's highly dependent on your specific situation.  I'd think you'd want to get tailored advice for that.""]","[""As a business owner, you are responsible for paying taxes on the profits earned by your business.

"What are the tax implications if I do some work for a company for trade, rather than pay?","[""Bartering is a tricky discussion. Yes, it definitely applies when you are self-employed and do a job that you would charge anyone else for, but what if you are helping a friend in your spare time?

If the company bought a computer that they loan to you to do occasional work for them, there's no reason you couldn't take the computer home and have that company retain ownership of the property. They could still expense the depreciation of the computer without giving it to you. If it were a car though, you would have to count mileage for personal use as income. What if you exchange occasional tech support for the use of an empty desk and Internet connection?

How do credit union loans and dividends vs interest work?,"['A credit Union makes loans exactly the same ways a bank does. A portion of the money deposited in  checking, savings, money market, Certificate of Deposit, or IRA is then used to make loans for cars, boats, school, mortgages, 2nd mortgages, lines of credit...

There are no investors in the ""company"" because the goal is not to make money. In general the entire package is better because there is no pressure to increase profits.  Fees are generally lower because they are there to discourage bad behavior, not as a way to make a profit off of the bad behavior.  Dividends/interest are treated the same way as bank interest. The IRS forms are the same, and it is reported the same way. Some of bizarre rules they have to follow: maximum number of transactions between accounts, membership rules, are there because banks want to make it harder to be a member of a credit union.']","[""A credit union is a non-profit financial institution that is owned and controlled by its members. Credit unions offer many of the same products and services as banks, including loans and savings accounts.

The credit union uses the money you and other members have deposited in savings accounts and other types of accounts to fund loans. When you make a loan payment, the credit union uses that money to pay back the other members who have deposited money in the credit union. This is why credit unions are able to offer lower rates on loans.A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a credit union's profits to its members. Credit unions are non-profit organizations, so any profits they make are returned to their members in the form of dividends on savings accounts and other types of accounts.

Travel expenses for an out-of-state rental,"['While the question is very localized, I\'ll answer about the general principle. My main question is with how far away it is (over 1000 miles), how do   I quantify the travel expenses? Generally, ""necessary and ordinary"" expenses are deductible. This is true for business and also true for rentals. But what is necessary and what is ordinary? Is it ordinary that a landlord will manage the property 1000 miles away by himself on a daily basis? Is it ordinary for people to drive 1000 miles every week? I\'d say ""no"" to both. I\'d say it would be cheaper for you to hire a local property manager, thus the travel expense would not be necessary. I would say it would be cheaper to fly (although I don\'t know if its true to the specific situation of the OP, but as I said - its too localized to deal with) rather than drive from Texas to Colorado. If the OP thinks that driving a thousand miles is indeed ordinary and necessary he\'ll have to justify it to the IRS examiner, as I\'m sure it will be examined. 2 trips to the property a year will be a nearly 100% write-off (2000   miles, hotels, etc). From what I understood (and that is what I\'ve been told by my CPA), IRS generally allows 1 (one) trip per year per property. If there\'s an exceptional situation - be prepared to justify it. Also, keep all the receipts (like gas, hotel, etc.... If you claim mileage but in reality you took a flight - you\'ll get hit hard by the IRS when audited). Also while I\'m up there am I allowed to mix business with pleasure? You cannot deduct personal (""pleasure"") expenses, at all. If the trip is mainly business, but you go out at the evening instead of staying at the hotel - that\'s fine. But if the trip is ""business"" trip where you spend a couple of hours at your property and then go around having fun for two days - the whole trip may be disallowed. If there\'s a reasonable portion dedicated to your business/rental, and the rest is pleasure - you\'ll have to split some of the costs and only deduct the portion attributed to the business activities. You\'ll have to analyze your specific situation, and see where it falls. Don\'t stretch the limits too much, it will cost you more on the long run after all the audits and penalties. Can I also write off all travel involved in the purchase of the   property? Although, again, the ""necessary and ordinary"" justification of such a trip is arguable, lets assume it is necessary and ordinary and generally justified. It is reasonable to expect you to go and see the property with your own eyes before the closing (IMHO, of course, I\'m not an authority). Such an expense can be either business or investment expense. If its a business expense - its deductible on schedule C. If its an investment expense (if you do buy the property), its added to the cost of the property (capitalized).

Why was S&P 500 PE Ratio so high on May 2009,"['Asking why the p/e was so high is best answered ""because reported earnings were so low"". Recall that the S&P500 bottomed in early March 2009 when the panic of the financial crisis reached exhaustion.  As noted on the page you have linked, the reported p/e ratios are computed using reported earnings from the trailing twelve months.  During those twelve months the banks were writing down all of the bad debt associated with the mortgage backed securities that has lost so much value.  This meant that the banks were reporting negative earnings.  Since the financial sector is a large part of the S&P500, this alone had an enormous effect on the index p/e.  However, the problem was compounded by a general collapse in earnings across the economy as consumers reacted to the resulting uncertainty.  The same site reports earnings for the previous years at $17.11 for the S&P500, compared to $76.17 for the year prior to 2008.  That is a collapse of about 78% in earnings.  Although the S&P500 has suffered badly during this time, stock market investors being forward looking were starting to price in improved earnings by May 2009.  Indeed, the S&P500 was up about 33% in just two months, from its low in March2009 to mid May2009.  Thus, by May of 2009 prices were not suffering to the same extent as reported trailing earnings.  This would account for the anomalous p/e value reporting in May2009.']","[""The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is a measure of how expensive a stock or market index is relative to its earnings. A high PE ratio can indicate that investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock or index because they expect future earnings to be high. Conversely, a low PE ratio can indicate that investors expect future earnings to be low or that the stock or index is undervalued.The S&P 500 is a stock market index that represents the performance of 500 large publicly traded companies in the United States. The PE ratio of the S&P 500 can fluctuate over time due to various factors, such as changes in earnings expectations, interest rates, and market sentiment.In May 2009, the S&P 500 PE ratio was relatively high due in part to the impact of the global financial crisis that began in 2007. The crisis caused a significant drop in stock prices, which led to a decrease in earnings for many companies. As a result, the PE ratio of the S&P 500 was elevated because the index's price was relatively low while earnings were also low.It's important to note that the PE ratio is just one factor to consider when evaluating a stock or market index. It's important to look at other metrics, such as the price-to-book ratio and the dividend yield, as well as the overall economic and market conditions.""]",,finance,22982

Logically, at some point, the growth must slow down.""]","[""If a company's dividends are growing faster than its cost of capital, it generally indicates that the company is generating excess cash flow and is able to pay out a portion of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. This can be a positive sign for investors, as it suggests that the company is financially healthy and has a strong business model.However, it is important to note that a company's dividends should not grow faster than its ability to generate profits. If this happens, the company may eventually become unable to sustain its dividend payments and may need to cut or eliminate dividends altogether. It is also important to consider the company's overall financial health and its future prospects when evaluating whether its dividends are growing at a sustainable rate.""]",,finance,19246

What is a 10 Year Treasury Note and How Can it be Used to Calculate the Intrinsic Value of a Stock?,"['It\'s a form of debt issued by the United States Treasury. As the name implies, a 10-year note is held for 10 years (after which you get the face value in cash), and it pays interest twice per year. It\'s being used in the calculator to stand for a readily available, medium-term, nearly risk-free investment, as a means of ""discounting"" the value that the company gains. The explanation for why the discounting is done can be found on the page you linked. As a Canadian you could use the yield of comparable Canadian treasury securities as quoted by Bank of Canada (which seem to have had the bottom fall out since the new year), although I don\'t suppose American notes would be hard for a Canadian investor to come by, so if you wanted to be conservative you could use the US figure as long as it\'s higher.']","['A 10-year Treasury note is a debt obligation issued by the U.S. government that pays periodic interest to bondholders and returns the principal when the bond matures. Treasury notes have maturities ranging from a few months to 30 years and are issued in denominations of $100. They are considered to be a low-risk investment because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.The intrinsic value of a stock is the perceived or calculated value of a company, based on its fundamental characteristics such as earnings, dividends, and assets. The intrinsic value can be used as a benchmark to determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued in the market.One way to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock is to use the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. This involves estimating the future cash flows that the company is expected to generate, and then discounting those cash flows back to the present value using a discount rate. The discount rate used in the DCF calculation can be based on the yield on a 10-year Treasury note, as this yield reflects the risk-free rate of return.By incorporating the yield on a 10-year Treasury note into the DCF calculation, investors can compare the expected returns from investing in a particular stock to the risk-free rate of return. If the expected returns from the stock are higher than the risk-free rate, it may be considered undervalued and a potentially good investment. Conversely, if the expected returns are lower than the risk-free rate, the stock may be considered overvalued.']",,finance,21231
Discount Rate vs. IRR,"[""The IRR is the Discount Rate r* that makes Net Present Value NPV(r*)==0. What this boils down to is two ways of making the same kind of profitability calculation.  You can choose a project with NPV(10%)>0, or you can choose based on IRR>10%, and the idea is you get to the same set of projects.  That's if everything is well behaved mathematically. But that's not the end of this story of finance, math, and alphabet soup. For investments that have multiple positive and negative cash flows, finding that r* becomes solving for the roots of a polynomial in r*, so that there can be multiple roots.  Usually people use the lowest positive root but really it only makes sense for projects where NPV(r)>0 for r<r* and NPV(r)<0 for r>r*.   To try to help with your understanding, you can evaluate a real estate project with r=10%, find the sum future discounted cash flows, which is the NPV, and do the project if NPV>0.   Or, you can take the future cash flows of a project, find the NPV as a function of the rate r, and find r* where NPV(r*)==0. That r* is the IRR.  If IRR=r*>10% and the NPV function is well behaved as above, you can also do the project. When we don't have to worry about multiple roots, the preceding two paragraphs will select the same identical sets of projects as meeting the 10% return requirement.""]","[""The discount rate and the internal rate of return (IRR) are two financial concepts that are closely related, but they are not the same thing.The discount rate is a measure of the time value of money. It is used to determine the present value of a future cash flow. For example, if you expect to receive $100 in one year and the discount rate is 10%, the present value of that cash flow is $90.10 ($100 / (1 + 10%)). The discount rate takes into account the opportunity cost of not investing the money elsewhere, as well as the level of risk associated with the investment.The internal rate of return (IRR) is a measure of the profitability of an investment. It is the discount rate that equates the present value of the investment's cash flows to the initial investment. In other words, it is the rate at which the net present value (NPV) of the investment is zero. The IRR is used to compare different investment options and determine which one is the most attractive based on their expected returns.In summary, the discount rate is used to determine the present value of a future cash flow, while the IRR is a measure of the profitability of an investment.""]",,finance,22313
Why should I trust investment banks' ratings?,"[""Investment banks will put out various reports and collect revenues from that along with their banking activity.

Or as @littleadv points out there could be those tracking the stocks not in the index that would have been forced to sell for another idea here. The Goldman note is a possible explanation but there could well be more factors in play here such as automated trading systems that seek to take advantage of what could be perceived as arbitrage opportunities. There can be quick judgments made on things which may or may not be true in the end.  After all, who knows exactly what is causing the sell-off.  Is it a bunch of stop orders being triggered?  Is it people actually putting in sell order manually?  Is it something else?

I was given a 1099-misc instead of a w-2 what are my next steps?,"['I agree that you should have received both a 1099 and a W2 from your employer. They may be reluctant to do that because some people believe that could trigger an IRS audit. The reason is that independent contractor vs employee is supposed to be defined by your job function, not by your choice. If you were a contractor and then switched to be an employee without changing your job description, then the IRS could claim that you should have always been an employee the entire time, and so should every one of the other contractors that work for that company with a similar job function. It\'s a hornet\'s nest that the employer may not want to poke. But that\'s not your problem; what should you do about it? When you say ""he added my Federal and FICA W/H together"", do you mean that total appears in box 4 of your 1099? If so, it sounds like the employer is expecting you to re-pay the employer portion of FICA. Can you ask them if they actually paid it? If they did, then I don\'t see them having a choice but to issue a W2, since the IRS would be expecting one. If they didn\'t pay your FICA, then the amount this will cost you is 7.65% of what would have been your W2 wages. IMHO it would be reasonable for you to request that they send you a check for that extra amount. Note: even though that amount will be less than $600 and you won\'t receive a 1099 in 2017 for it, legally you\'ll still have to pay tax on that amount so I think a good estimate would be to call it 10% instead. Depending on your personality and your relationship with the employer, if they choose not to ""make you whole"", you could threaten to fill out form SS-8. Additional Info: (Thank you Bobson for bringing this up.) The situation you find yourself in is similar to the concept of ""Contract-to-Hire"". You start off as a contractor, and later convert to an employee. In order to avoid issuing a 1099 and W2 to the same person in a single tax year, companies typically utilize one of the following strategies: Your particular situation is closest to situation 2, but the reverse. Instead of retroactively calling you a W2 employee the entire time, your employer is cheating and attempting to classify you as a 1099 contractor the entire time. This is frowned upon by the IRS, as well as the employee since as you discovered it costs you more money in the form of employer FICA. From your description it sounds like your employer was trying to do you a favor and didn\'t quite follow through with it. What they should have done was never switch you to W2 in the first place (if you really should have been a contractor), or they should have done the conversion properly without stringing you along.']","[""If you received a 1099-MISC form instead of a W-2, it generally means that you were paid as an independent contractor rather than an employee. As an independent contractor, you are responsible for paying your own taxes, rather than having them withheld from your pay by an employer.Here are the steps you should take:Determine your tax liability: You will need to calculate the total amount of income you received as an independent contractor and determine the amount of tax you owe on that income. You may need to pay self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax.File a tax return: If you received more than $400 in income as an independent contractor, you are required to file a tax return. You can use IRS Form 1040 to report your independent contractor income and calculate your tax liability.Pay your taxes: If you owe taxes, you will need to pay them by the tax filing deadline, which is typically April 15th. You can make a payment online, by phone, or by mail using a check or money order.Keep good records: It's important to keep good records of your independent contractor income and any expenses you incur in the course of your work. This will make it easier to file your tax return and claim any deductions or credits that you may be eligible for.If you have any questions or are uncertain about how to file your taxes as an independent contractor, you may want to consult with a tax professional or refer to IRS guidance on the subject.""]",,finance,19411

Keep in mind though, in most cases, if you lose your job, you are entitled to unemployment benefits from the government. How long should my mortgage be? 30 year amortization is the best. You can always opt to pay more each month.  But having that leverage with a 30 year loan can allow you to invest your savings in other opportunities, which can yield more than mortgage interest. Best of luck!""]","['The size of your down payment on a house will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of the home, the type of mortgage you are obtaining, and your personal financial situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:Conventional wisdom suggests that you should aim for a down payment of at least 20% of the purchase price of the home. This is because mortgage lenders typically require a down payment of at least 20% in order to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is an insurance policy that protects the lender in case you default on your loan. PMI can add significantly to your monthly mortgage payments, so avoiding it can save you a significant amount of money over the life of your loan.However, it is possible to obtain a mortgage with a down payment of less than 20%. Many lenders offer programs that allow you to put down as little as 3% or even 0% in some cases. These loans typically come with higher interest rates and may require you to pay PMI, so they may not be the best option if you have the means to make a larger down payment.In addition to the size of your down payment, you should also consider other factors such as your overall financial situation, your ability to save for a down payment, and your long-term financial goals. It may be worth saving up for a larger down payment if it means you can get a lower interest rate on your mortgage, or if it means you will have more equity in your home. On the other hand, if you have the opportunity to buy a home with a smaller down payment and it makes sense for your financial situation, it may be worth considering.Ultimately, the size of your down payment will depend on your personal financial circumstances and your long-term financial goals. It is important to carefully consider all of these factors before making a decision about how much to put down on a house.']",,finance,19152

"When I ask a broker to buy stock, what does the broker do?","['My answer isn\'t a full one, but that\'s because I think the answer depends on, at minimum, the country your broker is in, the type of order you place (limit, market, algo, etc.,) and the size of your order.

The Purpose of Change Machines ,"['I think you\'re talking about two types of machines, at least in the United States. The term change  machine usually refers to a machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller bills or coins. Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency, in which case they are also often known as bill changers. Exactly what bills or coins these machines return depends on the machine. Read the instructions on the machine to get the details (they\'re usually right on the machine). For example my apartment building has a machine that converts small bills like ones and fives to quarters, since the laundry machines only took quarters. The other type of machine are coin-cashing machines, like the Coinstar machines you might see at a grocery store. Many banks used to have these machines as well although in my area they\'re few and far between now. These machines perform the opposite function of the traditional change machine and convert smaller denominations (mostly coins) into bill form. For example if you dump all your accumulated pennies into the machine, it will probably give you bills and larger coins like quarters, dimes, nickels in exchange, after subtracting a small fee. I\'ve heard that now, some of these machines may give you a gift card of some kind instead of bills, although they\'ll still subtract a fee from your original amount, usually. Once again just read the instructions and they should tell you. When my bank had one of these machines, they didn\'t charge a fee as long as you were a customer at the bank. I\'m sure that varies from place to place and bank to bank though. Wikipedia\'s article has this to say (see the article for references): In some sections of the U.S., regional banks have begun offering free coin-counting services in the amount of a gift card. Refunds are often given in cash rather than in the form of a gift card. In some cases, it is not even necessary for the customer to have an account at the bank; the free service is offered as a way to attract new business from individuals who are not current account holders. TD Bank\'s ""Penny Arcade"" coin counters were free and available to both customers and non-customers in many branches, but as of November 2010, the bank charges a 6% fee for non-customers to use the machine.']","['Change machines, also known as bill changers or bill breakers, are machines that dispense coins or bills in exchange for a larger denomination of currency. They are commonly found in places such as laundromats, amusement parks, and vending machine locations where it is convenient for customers to have smaller denominations of money for transactions.Change machines can be programmed to accept a variety of different denominations of bills and coins, and they typically dispense change in the form of smaller bills and coins. Some change machines also have the capability to accept credit or debit card payments and dispense change in the form of a printed receipt.Change machines are useful because they allow customers to easily obtain smaller denominations of currency without having to go to a bank or store to make a purchase. This can be particularly convenient for customers who may not have access to a bank or who need to make a small purchase but only have a large bill on hand.Overall, the purpose of change machines is to provide a convenient way for customers to obtain smaller denominations of currency for transactions.']",,finance,21708
"Companies that use their cash to buy back stock, issue dividends, etc. — how does this this typically affect share price?","['If a company is valued correctly, then paying dividends should lower the share price, and buying back shares should leave the share price unchanged.  If the share price is $100, and the company pays a $10 dividend, then either its cash goes down by $10 per share, it is has to borrow money for the same amount, or some mixture. Either way, the value of the company has gone down by $10 per share.  If the share price is $100, and the company buys back 10 percent of its shares, then it also has to find the money, just as for the dividend, and the value of the company goes down by 10 percent. However, the number of shares also goes down by 10 percent, so the amount of value per share is the same, and the share price should stay unchanged.  Now there are psychological effects. Many people like getting paid dividends, so they will want to own shares of a company paying dividends, so the share price goes up. Similar with a share buyback; the fact that someone buys huge amounts of shares drives the price up. Both effects are purely psychological.  A buyback has another effect if the shares are not valued correctly. If the company is worth $100 per share but for some reason the shareprice is down to $50, then after the buyback the value per share has even gone up. Basically the company buys from stupid investors, which increases the value for clever investors holding on to their shares. If the shareprice were $200, then buying back shares would be a stupid move for the company.']","['Share buybacks, also known as stock buybacks, are a way for companies to reduce the number of outstanding shares of their stock on the market.

As a result, the price of the stock may increase after the buyback is announced or completed.Dividends, on the other hand, are payments made by a company to its shareholders out of its profits. Dividends can be paid in the form of cash or additional shares of stock. If a company announces that it will be paying a dividend, this may also increase the demand for the stock, which could lead to an increase in the stock price.However, it is important to note that the impact of buybacks and dividends on the stock price will depend on a variety of factors, including the overall performance of the company and the market conditions. In some cases, buybacks and dividends may not have a significant effect on the stock price, or the price may even decline.', ""Stock buybacks and dividends can affect the share price of a company in different ways.Stock buybacks: When a company buys back its own shares, it reduces the number of outstanding shares on the market, which can increase the demand for the remaining shares and potentially drive up the share price. However, it's worth noting that buybacks are not always a good thing for shareholders. For example, if a company is using its cash to buy back stock instead of investing in the business or paying down debt, it may not be creating value for shareholders in the long run.Dividends: Dividends are payments made to shareholders out of a company's profits. When a company announces that it will be paying a dividend, the share price may go up because investors see the dividend as a sign of financial stability and a way to generate income from their investment. However, it's also worth noting that when a company starts paying dividends, it may also be a signal that the company is not expecting to have significant growth opportunities in the near future, which could lead to a decline in the share price.In general, the effect of buybacks and dividends on share price will depend on the specific circumstances of the company and the market conditions at the time. It's important for investors to carefully consider these factors when deciding whether to buy or sell shares in a company.""]",,finance,21693
Offsetting the tax on vested RSUs with short term capital loss,"[""No. The gain on RSU is not a capital gain, it is considered wages and treated as part of your salary, for tax purposes. You cannot offset it with capital losses in excess of $3000 a year. If you have RSUs left after they vest, and you then sell them at gain, the gain (between the vesting price and the sale price) is capital gain and can be offset by your prior years' capital losses.""]","[""If you have received vested RSUs (restricted stock units) and you want to offset the tax you owe on them with a short-term capital loss, you can sell some investments that you own at a loss within the same tax year as you received the RSUs.

Short-term capital gains and losses are those on investments that you held for one year or less, while long-term capital gains and losses are those on investments that you held for more than one year.It's also important to note that you can only use up to $3,000 of capital losses each tax year to offset ordinary income, such as wages and salaries.

This means that the tax rate on the income from RSUs will depend on your marginal tax rate for the tax year in which the RSUs vest.To offset the tax on vested RSUs with short-term capital losses, you would need to sell securities that you own at a loss in the same tax year as the RSUs vest. If you have enough short-term capital losses, you can use them to offset the tax on the RSUs, reducing the amount of tax you owe.It is important to keep in mind that capital losses can only be used to offset capital gains, so if you do not have any capital gains in the same tax year, you will not be able to use capital losses to offset the tax on your RSUs. In this case, you may want to consider other strategies, such as making charitable donations or contributing to a retirement account, to reduce your tax burden.You should also be aware that there are limits on how much of your capital losses you can use to offset your ordinary income in any given tax year. For 2021, the limit is $3,000 per year, or $1,500 if you are married filing separately. If you have more capital losses than you can use in a given year, you can carry the excess forward to future tax years.It is always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to IRS guidelines to ensure that you are correctly reporting and paying taxes on your RSUs and capital losses.']",,finance,20468

Putting the gordon equation into practice,"[""The Gordon equation does not use inflation-adjusted numbers. It uses nominal returns/dividends and growth rates. It really says nothing anyone would not already know.  Everyone knows that your total return equals the sum of the income return plus capital gains.   Gordon simply assumes (perfectly validly) that capital gains will be driven by the growth of earnings, and that the dividends paid will likewise increase at the same rate. So he used the 'dividend growth rate' as a proxy for the 'earnings growth rate' or 'capital gains rate'. You cannot use inflation-removed estimates of equity rates of return because those returns do not change with inflation.  If anything they move in opposite directions.  Eg in the 1970's inflation the high market rates caused people to discount equity values at larger rates --- driving their values down -- creating losses.""]","['The Gordon equation is a mathematical relationship used to estimate the intrinsic rate of growth or decline of a population.

You can then plug these values into the equation to calculate the intrinsic rate of growth or decline of the population.It is important to note that the Gordon equation is just a model, and actual population growth or decline may deviate from the predicted values due to various factors such as changes in the environment, interactions with other species, and stochastic events.']",,finance,22675
"Selling property outside the US - gains are taxable, but how do they convert?","['Since you did not treat the house as a QBU, you have to use USD as your functional currency.

The capital gain / loss is then the difference between the two.

This link from the IRS has some details from that (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/0303021.pdf): Rev. Rul. 54-105, 1954-1 C.B. 12, states that for purposes of determining   gain, the basis and selling price of property acquired by a U.S. citizen living in a foreign country should be expressed in United States dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing as of the dates of purchase and sale of the property,   respectively. The text of this implies it is for U.S. citizen is living in a foreign country, but the court case makes it clear that it also applies in your scenario (house purchased while living abroad but now residing in the US): Appellants agree that the 453,374 pounds received for their residence should be translated into U.S. dollars at the $1.82 exchange rate prevailing at the date of sale. They argue, however, that the 343,147 pound adjusted cost basis of the residence, consisting of the 297,500 pound purchase price and the 45,647 pounds paid for capital improvements, likewise should be expressed in U.S. dollar terms as of the date of the sale. Appellants correctly state that, viewed “in the foreign currency in which it was transacted,” the purchase generated a 110,227 pound gain as of the date of the sale, which translates to approximately $200,000 at the $1.82 per pound exchange rate. ... However fair and reasonable their argument may be, it amounts to an untenable attempt to convert their “functional currency” from the U.S. dollar to the pound sterling. ... Under I.R.C. § 985(b)(1), use of a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is restricted to qualified business units (""QBU""s). ... appellants correctly assert that their residence was purchased “for a pound-denominated value” while they were “living and working in a pound-denominated economy,” ... And since appellants concede that the purchase and sale of their residence was not carried out by a QBU, the district court properly rejected their plea to treat the pound as their functional currency.']","['If you sell property that is located outside the United States, you will need to report the sale on your U.S. tax return and pay tax on any gain that you realize from the sale.

Your tax basis is generally the cost of the property, including any improvements that you made to it, plus any closing costs associated with the purchase. If you have owned the property for a long time, you may have a higher tax basis due to depreciation that you have claimed over the years.If the sales price is greater than your tax basis, you will have a gain on the sale.

Which shareholders cause news-driven whole market stock swings?,['News-driven investors tend to be very short-term focussed investors. They often trade by using index futures (on the S&P 500 index for instance).'],"['News-driven stock market swings can be caused by a variety of factors, including the actions of individual shareholders, as well as broader market forces and economic events. Some examples of events that can cause stock market swings include the release of earnings reports, changes in government policies or regulations, and geopolitical developments.It is important to note that stock market movements can be influenced by a wide range of factors, and it can be difficult to identify the specific actions or decisions of individual shareholders that may have caused a particular market swing. Additionally, the stock market is often influenced by the collective actions of many different shareholders, rather than the actions of any single individual or group.In general, it is important for investors to keep track of market news and developments, and to consider the potential impact of these events on their investments.

For example, if a major shareholder announces that they are selling a large portion of their shares in a company, this may cause the stock price to decline due to increased supply and reduced demand. Similarly, if a major shareholder announces that they are buying a large number of shares in a company, this may cause the stock price to rise due to increased demand.It is worth noting, however, that the impact of any individual shareholder on the overall stock market is likely to be relatively small compared to the broader economic and market forces that drive stock prices.""]",,finance,22202
"Should I consolidate loans and cards, or just cards, leaving multiple loans?","['First of all, congratulations on admitting your problem and on your determination to be debt-free.  Recognizing your mistakes is a huge first step, and getting rid of your debt is a very worthwhile goal. When considering debt consolidation, there are really only two reasons to do so: Reason #1: To lower your monthly payment.  If you are having trouble coming up with enough money to meet your monthly obligations, debt consolidation can lower your monthly payment by extending the time frame of the debt.  The problem with this one is that it doesn\'t help you get out of debt faster.  It actually makes it longer before you are out of debt and will increase the total amount of interest that you will pay to the banks before you are done.  So I would not recommend debt consolidation for this reason unless you are truly struggling with your cashflow because your minimum monthly payments are too high.  In your situation, it does not sound like you need to consolidate for this reason. Reason #2: To lower your interest rate.  If your debt is at a very high rate, debt consolidation can lower your interest rate, which can reduce the time it will take to eliminate your debt. The consolidation loan you are considering is at a high interest rate on its own: 13.89%.  Now, it is true that some of your debt is higher than that, but it looks like the majority of your debt is less than that rate.  It doesn\'t sound to me that you will save a significant amount of money by consolidating in this loan.  If you can obtain a better consolidation loan in the future, it might be worth considering. From your question, it looks like your reasoning for the consolidation loan is to close the credit card accounts as quickly as possible.  I agree that you need to quit using the cards, but this can also be accomplished by destroying the cards.  The consolidation loan is not needed for this. You also mentioned that you are considering adding $3,000 to your debt.  I have to say that it doesn\'t make sense at all to me to add to your debt (especially at 13.89%) when your goal is to eliminate your debt.  To answer your question explicitly, yes, the ""cash buffer"" from the loan is a very bad idea. Here is what I recommend: (This is based on this answer, but customized for you.) Cut up/destroy your credit cards.  Today.  You\'ve already recognized that they are a problem for you.  Cash, checks, and debit cards are what you need to use from now on. Start working from a monthly budget, assigning a job for every dollar that you have.  This will allow you to decide what to spend your money on, rather than arriving at the end of the month with no idea where your money was lost.  Budgeting software can make this task easier.  (See this question for more information. Your first goal should be to put a small amount of money in a savings account, perhaps $1000 - $1500 total.  This is the start of your emergency fund.  This money will ensure that if something unexpected and urgent comes up, you won\'t be so cash poor that you need to borrow money again.  Note: this money should only be touched in an actual emergency, and if spent, should be replenished as soon as possible.  At the rate you are talking about, it should take you less than a month to do this. After you\'ve got your small emergency fund in place, attack the debt as quickly and aggressively as possible.  The order that you pay off your debts is not significant. (The optimal method is up for debate.)  At the rate you suggested ($2,000 - 2,500 per month), you can be completely debt free in maybe 18 months. As you pay off those credit cards, completely close the accounts.  Ignore the conventional wisdom that tells you to leave the unused credit card accounts open to try to preserve a few points on your credit score.  Just close them. After you are completely debt free, take the money that you were throwing at your debt, and use it to build up your emergency fund until it is 3-6 months\' worth of your expenses.  That way, you\'ll be able to handle a small crisis without borrowing anything. If you need more help/motivation on becoming debt free and budgeting, I recommend the book The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey.']","['It can be a good idea to consolidate loans and credit card debt if it will help you manage your debt more effectively and potentially save money on interest. There are a few factors to consider when deciding whether to consolidate your loans and credit card debt:Interest rates: If you have high-interest credit card debt and low-interest loans, it may be more beneficial to focus on paying off the credit card debt first. On the other hand, if you have high-interest loans and lower-interest credit card debt, consolidating the loans and paying off the credit card debt separately may make more sense.Credit score: Consolidating your debt can potentially lower your credit score in the short term, especially if you open a new line of credit to pay off your existing debts. However, if you can successfully pay off your consolidated debt and improve your credit utilization, your credit score may improve over time.Payment terms: Consolidating your debt may change the terms of your payments, such as the length of your repayment period or the frequency of your payments. Make sure you understand how consolidation will affect your payments and budget accordingly.Ultimately, the decision to consolidate your debt will depend on your individual financial situation. It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor or a credit counselor to explore your options and determine the best course of action for your specific needs.']",,finance,20364

Why is the breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest of any importance?,"[""The reason it's broken out is very specific: this is showing you how much interest accrued during the month.  It is the only place that's shown, typically. Each month's (minimum) payment is the sum of [the interest accrued during that month] and [some principal], say M=I+P, and B is your total loan balance.  That I is fixed at the amount of interest that accrued that month - you always must pay off the accrued interest.  It changes each month as some of the principal is reduced; if you have a 3% daily interest rate, you owe (0.03*B*31) approximately (plus a bit as the interest on the interest accrues) each month (or *30 or *28).  Since B is going down constantly as principal is paid off, I is also going down. The P is most commonly calculated based on an amortization table, such that you have a fixed payment amount each month and pay the loan off after a certain period of time.  That's why P changes each month - because it's easier for people to have a constant monthly payment M, than to have a fixed P and variable I for a variable M. As such, it's important to show you the I amount, both so you can verify that the loan is being correctly charged/paid, and for your tax purposes.""]","['The breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest is important because it helps borrowers understand how their loan is structured and how each payment is applied. When you make a loan payment, a portion of the payment goes towards paying off the principal, or the amount of money you borrowed, and the remainder goes towards paying the interest, or the cost of borrowing the money.Understanding this breakdown can be helpful for a number of reasons. For example, if you know that a large portion of your payment is going towards interest, you may decide to try to pay off the loan as quickly as possible to reduce the amount of interest you pay overall. On the other hand, if you know that a large portion of your payment is going towards the principal, you may decide to make extra payments or pay off the loan early in order to pay off the debt more quickly.In addition, understanding the breakdown of your loan repayment can help you plan your budget and financial goals. For example, if you know that a significant portion of your monthly income is going towards loan payments, you may need to adjust your spending habits in order to afford your other financial obligations.']",,finance,22460

Will J&J last 50 more years? Will Apple? Who knows?""]","[""Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a bond to changes in interest rates. It is expressed in years, and tells you how much the price of a bond will change if interest rates move by 1%. For example, if a bond has a duration of 10 years, and interest rates increase by 1%, the price of the bond is expected to fall by 10%.Fixed-income duration refers to the duration of a fixed-income security, such as a bond. Equity duration refers to the duration of an equity security, such as a stock.Fixed-income securities tend to have longer durations than equity securities, because the cash flows from fixed-income securities are more predictable and occur over a longer period of time. As a result, the price of a fixed-income security is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the price of an equity security.It's important to note that duration is just one measure of risk, and it's not the only factor that investors should consider when evaluating the risk of a security.

Here are a few potential risks to keep in mind:The dividend may be cut or eliminated: Companies can choose to reduce or eliminate their dividends if they are experiencing financial difficulties or want to use their cash for other purposes. If a company cuts its dividend, the value of the stock may decline as a result.The company may be less stable: Dividend-paying stocks are often considered to be more stable than non-dividend paying stocks, but this is not always the case. Some companies that pay dividends may be in declining industries or have other financial challenges that make them less stable.Interest rate risk: When interest rates rise, the value of dividend-paying stocks may decline because investors may prefer to put their money into higher-yielding investments like bonds.Market risk: As with any stock, dividend-yielding stocks are subject to market risk. If the market declines, the value of these stocks may also decline.Overall, it's important to carefully consider the risks of any investment, including dividend-yielding stocks, and to diversify your portfolio to spread out your risk.""]",,finance,20552
Ways to avoid being labeled a pattern day trader,"['Sorry but you already provided the answer to your own question.  The simple answer is to \'not day trade\' but hold things for a longer period and don\'t trade a large number of different stocks every week. Seriously, have a look at the rules and see what it implies.. an average of 20 buys and sells of longer term positions PER DAY is a pretty fair bit of trading, that\'s really churning through the positions compared to someone who might establish positions with say 25 well picked stocks and might change even 5 of those a week to a different stock.  Or even a larger number of stocks but seeking to hold them for over a year so you get taxed at the long term cap gains rate. If you want to day trade, be prepared to be labeled as such and deal with your broker on that basis.  Not like they will hate you given all the fees you are likely to rack up.  And the government will love you also, since you\'ll be paying short term gains taxes.  (and trust me, us bogelheads appreciate the liquidity the speculative and short term folks bring to the market.) In terms of how it would impact you, Expect to be required to have a fairly substantial balance ($25K) if you are maintaining a margin account.

How and why does the exchange rate of a currency change almost everyday?,"['Money is money because people believe it is money. By ""believe it is money"", I mean that they expect they will be able to turn it into useful goods or services (food, rent, houses, truckloads full of iron ore, mining equipment, massages at the spa, helicopter rides, iPads, greenhouses, income streams to support your future retirement, etc). Foreign exchange rates change because people\'s ideas about how much useful goods or services they can get with various currencies change. For example: if the Zimbabwe government suddenly printed 10 times as much money as used to exist, you probably couldn\'t use that money to buy as much food at the Zimbabwe-Mart, so you wouldn\'t be willing to give people as many US-dollars (which can buy food at the US-Mart) for a Zimbabwe-dollar as you used to be able to. (It\'s not exactly that easy, because - for instance - food in the US is more useful to me than food in Zimbabwe. But people still move around all sorts of things, like oil, or agricultural products, or minerals, or electronics components.) The two main things that affect the value of a currency are the size of the economy that it\'s tied to (how much stuff there is to get), and how much of the currency there is / how fast it\'s moving around the economy (which tells you how much money there is to get it with). So most exchange rate shifts reflect a change in people\'s expectations for a regional economy, or the size of a money supply. (Also, Zimbabwe is doing much better now that it\'s ditched their own currency - they kept printing trillions of dollars\' worth - and just trade in US dollars. Their economy still needs some work, but... better.)']","['The exchange rate of a currency is the price at which one currency can be exchanged for another. It is determined by the supply and demand for a particular currency in the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market is a global decentralized market that determines the relative values of different currencies.There are several factors that can affect the supply and demand for a particular currency and, in turn, its exchange rate. Some of the most important factors include:Interest rates: Higher interest rates can attract foreign investment and increase demand for a particular currency, causing its value to appreciate (rise). Conversely, lower interest rates can discourage foreign investment and reduce demand for a particular currency, causing its value to depreciate (fall).Inflation: Higher inflation rates can erode the purchasing power of a particular currency, causing its value to depreciate. Conversely, lower inflation rates can increase the purchasing power of a particular currency, causing its value to appreciate.Political stability: Political instability or uncertainty can make a particular currency less attractive to investors and traders, causing its value to depreciate. Conversely, political stability can make a particular currency more attractive, causing its value to appreciate.Economic growth: Strong economic growth can increase demand for a particular currency and cause its value to appreciate. Conversely, weak economic growth can decrease demand for a particular currency and cause its value to depreciate.These are just a few of the many factors that can influence the exchange rate of a currency. As a result, exchange rates can fluctuate almost daily as traders and investors respond to changes in these and other factors.']",,finance,22082

One of your long-term goals ought to be to become the kind of person who finds joy in saving money rather than spending it.  Make friends with frugal people - look for those who prefer games nights and potlucks to nights out at the club buying expensive drinks and dinners at the newest steak joint in town.

Are you paying for any subscriptions or memberships that you don't use or need?Shop around for the best prices: Take the time to compare prices before you make a purchase. Look for sales and discounts, and consider using cashback or rewards credit cards to save even more.Use cash or debit cards instead of credit cards: Credit cards can be convenient, but they can also make it easy to overspend. Consider using cash or debit cards instead, which can help you stick to your budget.Find ways to increase your income: If you're struggling to make ends meet, consider looking for ways to increase your income. This could involve taking on additional work, starting a side hustle, or negotiating a raise at your current job.Remember that the key to spending less is to be mindful of your spending habits and to make conscious decisions about how you use your money.

What could be the harm in sharing my American Express statements online?,"['As a person who has had several part time assistants in the past I will offer you a simple piece of advise that should apply regardless of what country the assistant is located. If you have an assistant, personal or business, virtual or otherwise, and you don\'t trust that person with this type of information, get a different assistant.  An assistant is someone who is supposed to make your life easier by off loading work. Modifying your records before sending them every month sounds like you are creating more work for yourself not less. Either take the leap of faith to trust your assistant or go somewhere else.  An assistant that you feel you have to edit crucial information from is less than useful. That being said, there is no fundamental reason to believe that an operation in the Philippines or anywhere else is any more or less trustworthy than an operation in your native country. However, what is at issue is the legal framework around your relationship and in particular your recourse if something goes wrong.  If you and your virtual assistant are both located in the US you would have an easier time collecting damages should something go wrong.  I suggest you evaluate your level of comfort for risk vs. cost.  If you feel that the risk is too high to use an overseas service versus the savings, then find someone in the states to do this work.  Depending on your needs and comfort you might want to seek out a CPA or other licensed/bonded professional.  Yes the cost might be higher however you might find that it is worth it for your own piece of mind. As a side note you might even consider finding a local part-time assistant. This can often be more useful than a virtual assistant and may not cost as much as you think. If you can live without someone being bonded.  (or are willing to pay for the bonding fee) yourself,  depending on your market and needs you may be able to find an existing highly qualified EA or other person that wants some after hours work.   If you are in a college town, finance, accounting or legal majors make great assistants.  They will usually work a couple hours a week for ""beer money"", they have flexible schedules and are glad to have something pertinent to their degree to put on their resume when they graduate.

This can typically be done through a construction loan, which is a short-term loan that provides funds to cover the cost of building the new house. Construction loans typically require a down payment of at least 20% of the total cost of the project, and the loan is typically paid off once the construction is complete and the house is sold or refinanced.It's important to note that construction loans can be more expensive and have higher interest rates than traditional mortgages, as they involve a higher level of risk for the lender. You may also be required to have a higher credit score and a higher debt-to-income ratio to qualify for a construction loan.In addition to obtaining financing for the construction of the new house, you will also need to consider the financing for the land on which the new house will be built. If you already own the land, you may be able to use the equity in the land as collateral for the construction loan. If you need to purchase the land, you will need to obtain a separate mortgage loan to finance the purchase.Finally, it's important to consider the tax implications of tearing down an existing house and building a new one. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to claim certain tax deductions or credits for the construction of the new house, such as the cost of materials, labor, and design fees.

Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream may also be helpful in reducing inflammation and itching.\n\nAnother potential cause of red, itchy spots on the face is seborrheic dermatitis, which is a condition that causes a red, scaly rash on the face, scalp, and other areas of the body. It is often accompanied by itching and can be triggered by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, stress, and certain medications. If you think you may have seborrheic dermatitis, you may want to try using an over-the-counter antifungal cream or shampoo to help control the condition.\n\nIf your red, itchy spots do not improve with self-care measures, or if you are experiencing other symptoms such as fever, difficulty breathing, or swelling, it's important to see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. They will be able to determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment options.""]",,medicine,23220

These can help to exfoliate the skin and promote the growth of new, healthy skin cells.\n\nUse a gentle, non-abrasive facial scrub or alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) product to exfoliate the skin. This can help to remove dead skin cells and improve the overall texture and tone of your skin.\n\nConsider trying a chemical peel, which uses a solution to remove the top layers of skin, revealing newer, smoother skin underneath.\n\nUse a skin-lightening product containing ingredients such as hydroquinone or kojic acid to help fade hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone.\n\nAvoid picking at pimples or squeezing pimples, as this can worsen acne and lead to scarring.\n\nProtect your skin from the sun by wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Sun exposure can worsen hyperpigmentation and scarring.\n\nConsider seeing a dermatologist or other skin care professional for treatment options such as laser therapy, microdermabrasion, or other medical procedures. These treatments can be more effective at reducing the appearance of scars and acne marks, but they may be more expensive and may require multiple treatments.\n\nIt's important to note that it can take time for scars and acne marks to fade, and results may vary depending on the individual.

Regards,Jay Indravadan Patel,Physical Therapist or Physiotherapist""]","[""It's always important to speak with a healthcare professional about any health concerns you may have. However, here are some general treatment options for the conditions you mentioned:\n\nRheumatoid arthritis: Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis typically involves a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can help reduce inflammation and slow the progression of the disease. Physical therapy, exercise, and assistive devices such as canes or splints can also be helpful in managing the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHeadache: There are many different types of headaches, and treatment will depend on the specific type and severity of the headache. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can often be effective in relieving mild to moderate headaches. More severe headaches may require prescription medications or other treatments. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific headache.\n\nJaw pain: Jaw pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including teeth grinding, jaw injury, or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the jaw pain. In some cases, over-the-counter pain relievers or ice packs can help reduce inflammation and relieve discomfort. Other treatments may include physical therapy, bite guards, or medication to relax the muscles in the jaw.\n\nLow blood pressure: Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions. Treatment for low blood pressure may include increasing fluid intake, increasing salt intake, and taking medications to raise blood pressure. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific case of low blood pressure.\n\nTinnitus: Tinnitus is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears that is not caused by an external source.

"What causes difficulty to support weight while standing?Hello, my daughter is 9 months old and cannot support her own weight in a standing position. When I try to let her stand she bends forward at the waist. When she stands upright, it is on her toes and only for a few seconds. She is extremely flexible in the hips and has just now started doing an army low-crawl. What do you think is going on?","[""It's too early to make her stand and watch for her age of 9m and as long she could sit unsupported and crawl, it's Ok for the age. Sometimes joint laxity can show extreme flexibility but that too it's early to decide and wait till 12-18 months for reassessment.""]","[""It is normal for infants to develop the ability to support their own weight and stand upright at different ages. Most infants begin to pull themselves up to a standing position around 9-12 months of age and can stand unsupported around 12-15 months of age. However, every child is different and some may develop these skills earlier or later than others.\n\nThere are several factors that can affect an infant's ability to support their own weight and stand upright. These include muscle strength and coordination, balance, and overall physical development. Infants also need to learn how to use their muscles to control their movements and maintain their balance.\n\nIf your daughter is 9 months old and is having difficulty supporting her own weight and standing upright, it is possible that she simply needs more time to develop the necessary muscle strength and coordination. Encourage her to practice standing and moving around, but always supervise her to ensure that she is safe. If you are concerned about her development, it is always a good idea to consult with your pediatrician for further evaluation and guidance.""]",,medicine,23727

Hope my answer helps you. Regards']","[""If you are trying to get pregnant and have irregular periods, it may be helpful to track your menstrual cycle and try to identify any patterns or predict when you are most likely to ovulate. Ovulation is the process of the release of an egg from the ovary, and it is necessary for pregnancy to occur.\n\nThere are several ways you can track your menstrual cycle and try to predict when you are ovulating:\n\nKeep a menstrual calendar: This involves tracking the length of your menstrual cycle and the dates of your periods. The length of a menstrual cycle is typically 28 days, but it can range from 21 to 35 days. Ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day cycle, but this can vary based on the length of your cycle.\n\nUse ovulation predictor kits: These kits are available at pharmacies and can help you predict when you are ovulating by detecting the presence of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. LH surges just before ovulation and can be detected with an ovulation predictor kit.\n\nTrack your basal body temperature: Your basal body temperature is your body's temperature at rest. It tends to rise slightly after ovulation. By taking your temperature every morning before you get out of bed and tracking it over time, you may be able to identify patterns and predict when you are most likely to ovulate.\n\nIt is also important to talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your menstrual cycle and fertility. Your doctor may be able to suggest treatments or medications that can help regulate your menstrual cycle and increase your chances of getting pregnant. For example, the medication Fertyl (clomiphene) is often used to treat infertility in women with irregular periods. However, it is important to use this or any other medication only as directed by a healthcare provider.""]",,medicine,24127

There is ongoing debate about the safety of amalgam fillings, with some concerns about the potential health effects of the mercury they contain. However, the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence suggests that amalgam fillings are safe and do not pose a significant health risk when used in dental restorations.\n\nIf you are concerned about the potential health effects of your amalgam fillings and are considering having them removed, it is important to consult with a qualified dental professional. The process of removing amalgam fillings can release small amounts of mercury vapor, which can be inhaled. However, proper safety measures can be taken to minimize the release of mercury vapor during the removal process.\n\nYour dentist should use appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to mercury vapor during the removal process, such as using a high-volume evacuation system to remove the vapor, providing a rubber dam to isolate the tooth being worked on, and using a cold water spray to minimize the release of vapor. In addition, your dentist should provide you with a mouthguard to wear during the procedure to protect your oral tissues and reduce the amount of vapor you inhale.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind that the removal of amalgam fillings carries some risks, such as the possibility of damaging the tooth or surrounding tissues. Therefore, it is important to carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of amalgam removal with your dentist before making a decision.']",,medicine,23378

It's important to work with a healthcare provider to determine the cause of your pain and develop a treatment plan that is appropriate for your specific needs. In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help alleviate your pain:\n\nApply heat or cold to the affected area: Depending on your symptoms and the nature of your pain, you may find relief by applying heat (such as a hot pack or warm towel) or cold (such as an ice pack or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel) to the affected area.\n\nTake over-the-counter pain medication: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen can help reduce inflammation and pain. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may also be effective for relieving pain.\n\nUse stretching and strengthening exercises: Stretching and strengthening exercises can help improve flexibility and reduce muscle tension, which may help reduce pain. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider or physical therapist to develop a safe and effective exercise program.\n\nPractice relaxation techniques: Stress and tension can exacerbate pain, so it's important to find ways to relax and manage stress. Techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation can be helpful.\n\nIt's also important to continue working with your healthcare provider to determine the cause of your pain and develop a long-term treatment plan.

Treatment options for psoriasis include topical medications, light therapy, and oral or injectable medications. The specific treatment plan will depend on the type and severity of the psoriasis, as well as the individual's preference and overall health.\n\nTopical medications, which are applied to the skin, include corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, and topical retinoids.

This means that there is an abnormal amount of CSF present in the brain, which may be due to a decrease in the volume of brain tissue.\n\nThe ventricles and basilar cisterns, which are fluid-filled spaces within the brain, are described as being normal in size.\n\nOverall, the MRI report suggests that there are some areas of brain tissue damage and swelling present, but no evidence of an acute stroke or other serious brain injury. It is important to note that this interpretation is based on the information provided in the report and a complete evaluation of the MRI scan would require a more detailed review by a healthcare professional.']",,medicine,23409

Diaphragm pumps are commonly used in a variety of applications, including chemical processing, water treatment, and medical devices. They are known for their ability to handle abrasive and corrosive fluids, as well as liquids with high viscosities."", 'A diaphragm pump is a type of positive displacement pump that uses a flexible diaphragm to move a fluid. It consists of a casing, a diaphragm, a driving mechanism, and inlet and outlet valves.\\n\\nThe diaphragm is a flexible membrane that is attached to a rigid frame and divided into two chambers by a partition. One chamber is connected to the inlet valve and the other is connected to the outlet valve.\\n\\nThe driving mechanism, which can be an electric motor, a gas engine, or other power source, drives a piston or other mechanism that moves the diaphragm back and forth. As the diaphragm moves, it creates a vacuum in one of the chambers and forces fluid from the inlet valve into the chamber. The inlet valve then closes, and the outlet valve opens, allowing the fluid to be expelled from the pump.\\n\\nDiaphragm pumps are capable of pumping a wide range of fluids, including liquids, gases, and slurries, and can handle high viscosities, abrasive particles, and corrosive fluids. They are commonly used in a variety of applications, including chemical processing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and water treatment.\\n\\nThere are several types of diaphragm pumps, including air-operated diaphragm pumps, hydraulic diaphragm pumps, and mechanical diaphragm pumps.

The fluid is contained in a chamber within the housing, and the diaphragm is positioned between the fluid and the power source.\\n\\nAs the diaphragm is moved back and forth by the power source, it creates alternating pressure and vacuum conditions within the fluid chamber. The pressure changes cause the fluid to flow in and out of the chamber through inlet and outlet valves, which are controlled by the movement of the diaphragm.\\n\\nDiaphragm pumps are widely used in many applications due to their simplicity, reliability, and ability to handle a wide range of fluids, including those that are viscous, abrasive, or hazardous.

The pelvic outlet is also known as the pelvic inlet when viewed from the opposite direction.\\n\\nThe pelvic outlet is typically wider in women than in men due to the differences in their pelvis shape. In women, the pelvic outlet is oval-shaped and wider in the transverse direction (side to side), while in men, it is more circular and wider in the anteroposterior direction (front to back).\\n\\nThe boundaries of the pelvic outlet can be described using various terms and measurements, including:\\n\\nAnteroposterior diameter: The distance from the front to the back of the pelvic outlet, measured along the midline.\\nTransverse diameter: The distance from one side to the other of the pelvic outlet, measured along the midline.\\nOblique diameter: The distance from one side of the pelvic outlet to the opposite side, measured along an oblique line.\\nPelvic inlet: The upper opening of the pelvis, also known as the pelvic outlet when viewed from the opposite direction.\\nPelvic floor: The muscles and connective tissue that form the bottom of the pelvis, supporting the pelvic organs and providing stability and support during movement.\\nThe size and shape of the pelvic outlet can affect childbirth, as the baby must pass through this opening during delivery. A larger or differently shaped pelvic outlet may require different techniques or interventions during childbirth, such as the use of forceps or a cesarean delivery (also known as a C-section).']",,open_qa,17426

Why does a computer only last at most 4 or 5 years ? Why ca n't a computer last forever ?

Technology advances at a significant pace and computers are built to take advantage of these advances .', 'A PC could last for longer than they generally do , but as I noted in my response to /u / limbodog , there are economic incentives for manufacturers to not make them more robust . Customers tend to pick PCs based on things like price and performance ( including running the OS of choice ) . It is hard for customers to gauge things like reliability , so it tends not to be the prime factor in making a buying decision . PC makers want to keep warranty returns within an acceptable range without incurring a lot of extra engineering and manufacturing expense . And they want to emphasize the things that will get consumers to buy their machine . So as a result , they spend just enough on engineering to make it likely that the PC will last long enough . It \'s a business decision . This also has historically worked out for the industry because the ever increasing processing power of microelectronics has meant that after a few years , a PC is considered "" old "" and "" slow "" . Microsoft has helped this by continually bloating Windows with patches to help slow machines down over time . So consumers have gotten used to the idea that they "" need "" to buy a new computer every few years .', 'Who says they last 4 - 5 years ?

Some of those components, like the hard drive or the battery, can wear out over time with use. Others, like the processor or the memory, can become outdated as technology advances and newer, more powerful components become available. Because of these limitations, computers typically don't last forever. However, with proper care and maintenance, you can often extend the lifespan of your computer by keeping it clean, making sure it has adequate ventilation, and using it in a way that doesn't put too much strain on its components. It's also worth noting that the average lifespan of a computer can vary depending on the type of computer and how it's used. For example, a desktop computer that is used infrequently and has a high-quality power supply may last longer than a laptop that is used heavily and has a lower-quality power supply.""]",4476.0,reddit_eli5,3604

This process is called bremsstrahlung, which means ""braking radiation"" in German. The X-rays produced by the generator are then directed towards the part of the body being examined, and they pass through the body and are captured on film or a digital detector on the other side. \nX-rays are used in many medical and industrial applications because they can pass through most materials and produce images of the inside of objects.

The problem was that in the last 2000 years another group of people had come to live there . They called themselves the Palestinians .

At its core, the conflict is about competing claims to land and sovereignty in the region known as Palestine, which includes the modern state of Israel and the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The conflict has its roots in the late 1800s, when Jewish immigrants began moving to Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire. These immigrants, known as Zionists, believed that Palestine was the ancient homeland of the Jewish people and that they had a right to live there. However, the region was already home to a large Arab population, which opposed the influx of Jewish immigrants and the establishment of a Jewish state. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, the League of Nations granted a mandate to Britain to administer Palestine. The British government encouraged Jewish immigration to Palestine, but also promised to protect the rights of the Arab population. In 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem being designated as an international city. The Jewish community accepted the plan, but the Arab states rejected it and launched a war against the newly established state of Israel. Since then, the conflict has continued, with numerous wars, negotiations, and peace agreements attempted to resolve the dispute. The main issues at stake are control of Jerusalem, the status of Palestinian refugees, the building of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, and the right of Palestinian self-determination. The conflict has also been fueled by religious and cultural differences, as well as political and economic interests. It has caused significant suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians, and has had a major impact on the region and the world.']",426.0,reddit_eli5,2033

Long answer : Back when the typewriter came out , typing too quickly on the device caused the keys to jam . So there had to be a medium of typing quickly , but not so fast that you jam your machine . Thus , QWERTY was born . It is totally designed to slow you down while typing to avoid jamming your typewriter . Also being able to type the word typewriter using only the top row of keys was probably a selling point , too . There are other , vastly improved keyboard layouts , but ultimately they are not used because the QWERTY style is what people grew up with , and they are too stubborn to make the switch that should have happened when computers first came around .

The machine , being a new invention , was a bit slow and clunky . If two letters were hit in quick succession , the keys would clash ( their swinging bars ) and the machine would ( in essence ) freeze . The inventor took common letter pairs , such as T and H and made sure they were at a safe distance from one another as to avoid failure on the part of the machine .']","['The layout of a computer keyboard is based on the layout of a traditional typewriter keyboard. The first successful mechanical typewriter was developed by Christopher Latham Sholes in the 1870s, and the layout of the keys was designed to reduce the risk of jamming the keys as they were struck by the hammers. The keys are arranged in a QWERTY layout, which is named after the first six letters on the top row of the keyboard. The QWERTY layout was designed to slow down typists so that the mechanical arms on the typewriter would not jam.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of computers, keyboards were designed to mimic the layout of typewriters, and so the QWERTY layout became the standard for computer keyboards as well.

What is a computer ' memory leak ' ? I see it 's a huge issue with PC software but have no clue what it means . Can someone kindly explain it to me in simple terms please Explain like I'm five. ,"['Modern operating systems let you run multiple programs at once , but you only have one pool of RAM that they all have to share . The way that works is that when a program wants memory , it asks the operating system for however much it needs , and the OS finds a block that \'s not being used and loans it to the program . When the program is done using the memory , it \'s supposed to return it so other programs can use it . A memory leak happens when a program forgets about a block of memory the operating system gave it . As far as the operating system is concerned , it still has that block "" checked out "" , but the program ca n\'t do anything with it , and it ca n\'t return it back to the operating system because it ca n\'t find it . The memory is n\'t gone permanently- when the program exits , the operating system knows it does n\'t need the memory any more so it marks all the memory that was checked out by the program as "" available "" again . But it \'s not going to be available as long as that program is still running . It \'s only a big problem if the program keeps doing this . If it keeps hitting the code where it asks for more memory , but never returns any of it . Since it \'s not giving any memory back , the program will , over time , consume more and more of your computer \'s memory until you do n\'t have any more memory to give it . At that point , the computer has three choices : 1 . It can start rejecting requests from programs that ask for more memory ( which generally results in those programs crashing ) 2 . It can try storing additional data on the hard drive , which keeps the computer running but is something like 1000x slower than RAM so your computer will slow to a crawl 3 . It can try to figure out which program is stealing all of the memory and terminate that one ( Linux does this , Mac and Windows do n\'t since some programs do n\'t deal well with not having time to clean up ) EDIT : formatting', ""Software developer here , Memory is a finite resource , your computer has only so much of it . Every program needs memory , and it 's use has to be coordinated to ensure no two programs overwrite each other .

Typically , when a program needs memory , it will request what it needs , and when it 's done with that memory , it will release it back into the pool of available memory . Most programs , it 's the responsibility of the programmer to allocate and free the memory . Oversights are common , and an algorithm may allocate memory without releasing it when finished . The OS does n't know the program is done with that memory , it does n't know there 's an error that is allocating without releasing memory , and the program error may be such that the program loses track of which bytes it no longer needs , and now it ca n't release it back to the OS .

How AI technology works in first / third person shooter videogames ? How do AI characters react to your moves in shooter videogames ? Also how do difficulty levels work for AI ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Valve has published a [ slide deck ( PDF ) ] ( URL_0 ) on how they designed the AI for Left 4 Dead . It \'s a bit more on the technical side if that \'s what you \'re interested in . Difficulty levels are just based on how fast the AI reacts and how much error you allow it to have . It \'s really easy to make the "" perfect "" AI because the computer always knows exactly where you are . So to make the game playable , you have to make the AI more stupid- it has to have some random error in its shots and you have to simulate some form of "" vision "" and reaction time or else the bad guys will just snipe you with a hitscan weapon from across the map as soon as the game starts . For a more difficult game , you just turn down the stupid factor .', ""Disclaimer : not an A.I. programmer , but this is my understanding of how you can go about it . There may be better ways to script an A.I. Typically you are programming a series of ' If this Then that ' statements . There can be levels of complexity in how this is done , but it can be generalized somewhat to ' If- > Then ' . For example , lets assume that we have a PlayerChar object that can return its location . We can check if it is in range , aim at it , and fire at that location IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { aimAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; fireAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; } would check if the Player 's Character is within the AI characters ' range ' , ' aim ' at that location , and ' fire ' at that location . You might also program the A.I. to look for cover . Lets assume we have an array that stores nearby objects that are ' cover ' , and can choose randomly from that array to decide where to hide before moving to that location IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { coverArray = searchForCover(me.location ) ; cover = pickRandom(coverArray ) ; moveToLocation(cover.location ) ; IF ( isInRange(PlayerChar.location ) ) THEN { aimAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; fireAt(PlayerChar.location ) ; } } Using logical steps in that manner , we could program a very basic enemy A.I. that checks for an enemy in range , looks for cover , moves to cover , and begins to aim and fire at the player . Depending on the complexity of the A.I. these logical steps can get very , very complicated , and have a lot of checks and special logic , e.g A.I. can only detect in a particular cone of view , they can detect sound , vision , they can react to alarms and move to that location , so on and so forth . With difficulty levels , what you might adjust is how well the A.I. reacts . Maybe they have better range , a wider cone of vision , maybe they pick better cover , or are more ' intelligent ' with how they react to your presence . For example , at a lower difficulty , I might allow the A.I. to have more of a delay before searching for cover . But at a higher difficulty , not only will they always run for cover , but they will coordinate with nearby A.I. to lay down alternating fire to keep your character suppressed . With programming an A.I , you usually already have the code for how the ' player ' character works . You now are designing code to do all the things a ' player ' character can do , but automatically based on known inputs ( e.g. the player moves into range , an alarm goes off , an event script tells the A.I. where to go , etc . )"", ""There is really no single answer to this question : shooter video games are not all exactly alike , and even small changes in the game ( available weapon choices , player abilities , common features and motifs in maps ) could require somewhat different behavior from the AI in order to make sense . For example , a shooter with many splash damage weapons would require effective AI to actively try to avoid standing too close to other AI bots , while this would not be a factor in shooters that mostly involve high accuracy , slow firing weapons . Now , this is a gross simplification ( especially since I have limited knowledge of Artificial Intelligence techniques and no knowledge of game - oriented AI ) but a reasonable model for the AI could be a classical State - based representation of the world . State - based representation means that at any given point in time , the algorithm ruling the bot will consider all sorts of various factors ( distance from player , line of sight , player 's equipped weapon , map topography etc ) and use some pre - defined function in order to evaluate the Value of that state ( the higher the value , the more likely the bot will want to be in that state ) . The bot will then evaluate some ( or all ) of its available moves , create many estimates for the possible states that will be created as a result ( and estimate the probability of each hypothetical state ) , and then use another computation ( such as the average state value , or the maximal minimum if the AI wants to minimize risk to itself ) in order to finally select what move to perform . This action is repeated between every two moves the bot performs . It 's not always a very hard computation -- mostly it depends on how many moves deep the algorithm will consider . Having such a system in place , it is possible to tweak the AI 's difficulty level by introducing errors , limiting the amount of moves considered , limiting options at specific instances or even explicitly forcing the algorithm to make sub - optimal choices , say , 5 % of the time . Naturally many , many other types of AIs exist . What I covered is really just a tip of the iceberg .""]","['In a first/third person shooter video game, the AI characters are computer-controlled characters that move and act in the game.

Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi or Kanji in Japanese) are the primary written form of Chinese and have a long history dating back over 3,000 years.

Pinyin cannot represent the meaning of the character, only the pronunciation. \nAdditionally, replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin as the primary written form of Chinese would be a massive undertaking that would involve changing the way that Chinese is taught in schools, updating dictionaries and other reference materials, and potentially requiring people to learn a new writing system.

This is why , little five year old , you should work to present yourself as best you can .']","[""Ayn Rand was a writer and philosopher who is known for her ideas about individualism and capitalism. Some people hate her because they disagree with her ideas about selfishness being a virtue, and they think her views are overly simplified and naive. Other people might hate her because of the way she presents her ideas, which can be very dogmatic and absolutist. Still, others might simply find her writing style unappealing or find her personality off-putting. It's important to remember that not everyone has to agree with someone else's ideas, and it's okay to dislike someone's work without hating them as a person.""]",41.0,reddit_eli5,1648

Women were not individuals back then , but part of their husband 's amassed wealth and influence . The Mona Lisa is the antitheses of that trend .

This can be a problem because the bone may not heal correctly. When a bone is broken, the body tries to fix it by creating new cells to mend the break. These new cells eventually turn into new bone, which helps the broken bone heal. However, if the bone is not properly aligned while it is healing, it may heal in the wrong position. This can cause the bone to be weaker and more prone to breaking again in the future. It can also cause the joint to not work properly, which can make it difficult to use your hand or wrist. If you think you have broken a bone, it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible.

One reason was that Japan was seeking to expand its empire and saw the United States as a potential obstacle to its ambitions. Japan also wanted to secure access to the natural resources of Southeast Asia, and believed that by attacking the United States, it could deter the United States from interfering with its plans. Another reason for the attack was that the United States had imposed economic sanctions on Japan in response to Japan's aggressive actions in China and Southeast Asia.

IIRC , T - Mobile started calling their 3 G network "" 4 G "" after an upgrade made it much faster . Other carriers joined in and eventually the ITU - R said , "" That 3 G is pretty advanced . I guess you guys can call it 4G. "" The ITU - R had two big goals that were n\'t being met : speed requirements , and a network that routes calls using Internet - based technology . Depending on your carrier , 4 G can mean different technologies and different levels of battery drainage ( although battery drainage also depends on a number of other factors ) .

WiFi is a wireless internet connection that relies on a router or other device to connect to the internet, while 4G is a cellular connection that uses a network of towers and antennas to connect to the internet. This means that 4G can be faster in some cases, especially if you are in an area with a strong 4G signal.\n\nIt's also possible that you are experiencing faster speeds with 4G because the network is less congested.

How does hydrogen turn into people ? I know you 've heard the quote -- I saw fourteen of you use it today . But how ? What 's the chain of events that begins with hydrogen and ends with people ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Stars are bright and hot because in their cores they have nuclear fusion going on . Nuclear Fusion is when small elements are crunched together ( fused ) to form larger elements . Depending on the star , different atoms will be combined to create different elements . Some stars convert hydrogen into helium . Other stars convert helium into relatively light elements ( like oxygen and carbon ) , and still other stars ( usually very large stars that are in the process of dying ) create heavier elements like gold and uranium . Some stars will explode when they die , spilling a chunk of their constructed elements out into the universe . These elements might form into other stars ( creating more heavy elements ) or they might form into planets . Now , what about your body ? Your body is made up of cells , which are made up of molecules , which are made up of elements . Since you * are n't * made up of entirely hydrogen , every element in your body must have at some point been formed by a star . So hydrogen turns into people , but in a kind of roundabout way . First hydrogen has to turn into helium ( in a star ) , then the helium has to turn into even heavier elements ( also in a star ) , then the heavier elements need to turn into a planet ( after the star explodes ) , then that planet has to produce life ( through abiogenesis(we're actually not quite sure how this specifically happened on earth ) ) , and then that life has to turn into people ( through evolution ) ."", 'It \'s a pretty terrible quote , frankly . But there are two important things you need to know about to understand this : baryogenesis and nucleosynthesis . Settle down , I \'m gon na explain them . You \'ve heard of protons , yeah ? Protons are one of the three particles that atoms are made of . Protons are particles called * baryons * ; a protons is one type of baryon . There \'s another type of baryon that \'s also important : It \'s called a neutron . There are about a * zillion * other types of baryons that * are n\'t * important to us right now , but take all of these things collectively and we call them baryons . Baryons are not elementary things . That is , they \'re things which are made of other things . What are they made of ? A variety of particles that are called * quarks . * The question , then , is how did quarks * initially * get together to make baryons ? Or in other words , how did the first baryons come to exist ? The answer is the Big Bang . The Big Bang was the earliest period in the history of the universe , lasting from * zero * — what we call the time of the very first event that ever happened — to about 400,000 years later . Early on in the Big Bang , the universe was very hot and dense , so hot and dense that no matter could exist . Later , as the universe cooled , the first quarks appeared . But it turns out quarks , by themselves , are not stable , for deep and complicated reasons we wo n\'t go into here . Below a certain energy density , quarks are only stable when they link up in pairs and in threes . So as the universe cooled , those first primordial quarks did just that : They hooked up in pairs and in threes . The pairs we call mesons and we do n\'t care about them right now ; the three - particle collections of quarks we call * baryons * , and the proton is the lightest of all the baryons . But when the quarks first congealed into baryons , the result was both baryons and * antibaryons * . You know , like antimatter ? When a baryon of one type encounters an antibaryon of another type , the two particles annihilate each other , meaning they cancel each other out and release photons . When a * heavy * baryon and a heavy antibaryon get together , they release * very energetic * photons . Very energetic photons do n\'t want to stay photons any more ; they want to decay into lighter particles . We call these lighter particles * leptons * . The electron , which you \'ve doubtless heard of , is a lepton . So let \'s review what we \'ve got so far : First the universe was very hot . As it cooled , quarks appeared . As it cooled further , quarks hooked up in pairs and triplets to form mesons and baryons and their antiparticles . But the mesons and baryons and their antiparticles all got together and mutually annihilated , releasing energetic photons which decayed into electrons . That \'s how both protons and electrons first came into existence . Of course , that raises the question : If all the baryons got together with all the antibaryons and annihilated to make photons and leptons … how come there are still baryons in the universe ? I mean , we \'re * surrounded * by atoms made of protons and neutrons , and those are baryons , so how \'d they get here ? The answer is called * baryon asymmetry * . See , way back when the free quarks first condensed into baryons and antibaryons , for every ten billion antibaryons that formed , ten billion * and one * baryons formed . So when all the annihilation happened , we had one baryon in ten billion left over with no partner to annihilate with . So those particles stayed around , and that \'s the origin of all the baryonic matter in the universe today . Why did that baryon asymmetry exist ? Nobody knows for sure . We already know about processes in nature that slightly favor baryons over antibaryons , so we know it \'s possible for that asymmetry to exist . But its precise nature is gon na remain a mystery for a while yet . Anyway , there we are , a bit after the start of the Big Bang . Quarks appeared , hooked up to make baryons , baryons annihilated releasing leptons and a * very slight * trace of leftover baryons . Meaning we had a universe that was filled with a hot gas of mostly protons and electrons and basically nothing else . As this gas cooled , the protons — which have positive electric charge — and the electrons — negative electric charge — got together . You know what you get when you put a proton and an electron together , do n\'t you ? You get * hydrogen . * That \'s how hydrogen came to exist : The universe cooled , and all those free protons and electrons hooked up . So the universe went from being filled with a hot electron - proton plasma to a merely warm ( a few thousand degrees ) neutral hydrogen gas . Well , this hydrogen gas was n\'t perfectly evenly distributed . It was denser in some places than in others . In places where it was denser , gravity started to pull the gas together to make it denser still . Once enough hydrogen gas gets together , a process called * nuclear fusion * can happen . Basically , if you squish two hydrogen nuclei — protons , in other words — together , they \'ll * stick * and make a helium nucleus . And if you stick two heliums together you get a beryllium , which is unstable and decays into a lithium … and so on . The trick is , none of these reactions can happen unless the hydrogen gas is really hot and really dense , which means you need a lot of it in one place . It took a few million years for this to happen , but once it did , you got * stars . * Stars are where * nucleosynthesis * happens . You start with hydrogen and smoosh the nuclei together to make bigger nuclei , then smoosh those nuclei together to make still bigger nuclei … then the star explodes . Because those first stars that existed did n\'t live very long . They were really inefficient , so once they got to a point where they could n\'t support themselves by fusing hydrogen into helium , they popped like balloons and scattered their contents through space . Which meant now you had this big clouds of hydrogen * and helium * , which again started to collapse under their own weight and turned into the next generation of stars . These fused the heavier stuff inside them into still heavier stuff , then popped and scattered their fusion products through space , products like carbon and nitrogen and oxygen . These subsequent clouds collapsed again and formed stars … but that \'s not all . Those clouds also congealed to form things smaller than stars , made up of heavier elements that had n\'t been present in the universe before , elements like iron and nickel and silicon , plus in at least one case a lot of leftover hydrogen that bonded with oxygen . We call these smaller things * planets * and the leftover - hydrogen - plus - oxygen * water * . And then one of those planets ended up having people on it . So yes , in a sense hydrogen turned into people , first through the process of baryogenesis — where hydrogen appeared for the first time in the universe — and then through nucleosynthesis — where hydrogen got smooshed together to make more interesting things inside the cores of about three generations of stars and about ten billion years . But just saying that "" hydrogen turns into people "" somehow manages to throw away all the * interesting * stuff and leave just one mundane , totally uninteresting fact that \'s sort - of true but not really .', ""Our sun is in it 's second life cycle , and is in the region of 4.5 billion years old . Before this , a much bigger star , made of 99.9 % hydrogen a little helium and a pinch of lithium ( all residue from the big bang , ) was floating around in space somewhere . This star had enough gravity in its core to fuse hydrogen in to larger heavier atoms like oxygen , carbon , iron and everything else that makes up the earth . Being so big , this star went into supernova . Basically it exploded , spewing all these heavy atoms out into nowhere . Thicker parts of this cloud of atoms started to gravitate towards each other , slowly clumping together , getting hotter and increasing its gravitational pull . As this clump grew in mass , it began the process of nuclear fusion again . The birth of a second , much smaller star from what was left of the first . Now , still spewed around this young star is all the thinner regions of the cloud of atoms . The gravity of the star , combined with centrifugal ( spinning ) force , began swirling the cloud into orbit around the star . The cloud , little by little , got thicker in places where all these atoms started clumping together . By centrifugal force and the even pull of gravity , these clumps were shaped into spheres , and became planets . Those closer to the sun are mostly made of dense iron - being heavier it was pulled closer by the new star - and those farther away are made from light , less dense gasses . In the earth 's case , a large body of molten iron was surrounded by a thin cover of mostly hydrogen and helium . As the earth began to cool , forming the crust , volcanoes were erupting intensely over the surface , spilling forth water vapour , carbon dioxide , methane and ammonia . A bit more cooling and bodies of water started to form , early oceans that were void of oxygen . The earth was in this state 3.5 - 4 billion years ago . Through electrical activity ( lightening ) , and the combining of early atmosphere gasses with the new oceans , and the odd atom of phosphorous that was kicking around , the first few basic building blocks of life were created . This pre - biotic soup , as it is known , consisted of a few amino acids and a couple of RNA bases . Add a few hundred million years , a few of these building blocks had formed into self - replicating molecules . A few of these molecules became bound together in an enclosed membrane , complete with instructions for copying itself , and life began . These very early bacteria - formed around 3 billion years ago - was the starting point for every living this on earth . Basic biological and biochemical processes were worked out . 2.7 - 2.2 billion years ago , the most important of biological process was worked out - photosynthesis . Suddenly , bacteria could create energy rich molecules using abundant CO2 and sunlight . But more importantly , they started mass producing oxygen . Oxygen changed everything . Much more energy was utilised when respiring with oxygen , and that meant life could replicate and diversify much much quicker . Bacteria started compartmentalizing regions of there cells , increasing efficiency . Some cells started collaborating , increasing survival , and some of these multi - celled organisms developed specialized regions , allowing them to out compete others . The rest came down to survival of the fittest , with the most diversified most likely to reproduce and pass on those characteristics . Add another billion years or so , and that led to you .""]","[""Hydrogen doesn't turn into people directly. However, hydrogen is an important part of the process that allows living things, including people, to exist. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and it is found in many different places, including the sun and other stars. The sun is a giant ball of gas that is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, and it gives off light and heat. This light and heat are what allow life to exist on Earth. On Earth, plants use the energy from the sun to turn carbon dioxide and water into food through a process called photosynthesis. When plants make food, they use the energy from the sun to combine hydrogen and oxygen atoms from water molecules to form glucose, which is a type of sugar. Glucose is a source of energy for plants, and it is also a source of energy for animals that eat plants. So, in a way, hydrogen is an important part of the process that allows living things, including people, to exist because it is used by plants to make food. When animals eat plants, they get the energy from the food that the plants made using hydrogen, and that energy is used to fuel their bodies and keep them alive.""]",638.0,reddit_eli5,2245

The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of ""intelligent"" global behavior, unknown to the individual agents. Examples of swarm intelligence in natural systems include ant colonies, bee colonies, bird flocking, hawks hunting, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.\nThe application of swarm principles to robots is called swarm robotics while swarm intelligence refers to the more general set of algorithms.

In the same way that the RAM is used by sequential-algorithm designers to model algorithmic performance (such as time complexity), the PRAM is used by parallel-algorithm designers to model parallel algorithmic performance (such as time complexity, where the number of processors assumed is typically also stated). Similar to the way in which the RAM model neglects practical issues, such as access time to cache memory versus main memory, the PRAM model neglects such issues as synchronization and communication, but provides any (problem-size-dependent) number of processors.

"Please explain what is ""Jerry Fodor""","['Jerry Alan Fodor (/ˈfoʊdər/; April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and the author of many crucial works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science. His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had ""an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960."" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.\nFodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation.[citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.\nFor Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or ""organs"", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the ""central processing"" part of the mind, which has a more global and less ""domain specific"" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.:\u200a73–75\u200a\nAlthough Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.']","['Jerry Fodor was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist.

This view holds that the mind is composed of a number of independent systems or modules, each of which is specialized for processing a particular type of information. Fodor argued that these modules are innate and dedicated to specific tasks, such as perception, language, and reasoning. He also proposed that mental states are individuated by their causal roles, which he called ""functional roles.""\n\n\n\nFodor was also a leading figure in the development of the theory of computationalism, which holds that the mind is a computational system and that mental processes can be understood in terms of computations.

It is considered an emergent behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.']","['Flocking is a type of coordinated group behavior that is exhibited by animals of various species, including birds, fish, and insects. It is characterized by the ability of the animals to move together in a coordinated and cohesive manner, as if they were a single entity.\n\n\n\nFlocking behavior is thought to have evolved as a way for animals to increase their chances of survival by working together as a group. For example, flocking birds may be able to locate food more efficiently or defend themselves against predators more effectively when they work together. Flocking behavior is also thought to help animals stay together and maintain social bonds.\n\n\n\nThere are several different models that have been proposed to explain the mechanisms behind flocking behavior. One of the most well-known models is the ""boids"" model, which was developed by computer graphics researcher Craig Reynolds in 1986. This model describes the behavior of a flock of birds as being determined by three simple rules: separation (avoiding collisions with other members of the flock), alignment (tending to move in the same direction as other members of the flock), and cohesion (tending to stay close to other members of the flock).\n\n\n\nFlocking behavior has been studied extensively in a variety of fields, including biology, computer science, and engineering. It has also been used as a model for the development of artificial intelligence and robotics, as it provides a simple yet powerful example of how complex group behavior can emerge from simple individual rules.']",,wiki_csai,18414

"Please explain what is ""Mixture model""","['In statistics, a mixture model is a probabilistic model for representing the presence of subpopulations within an overall population, without requiring that an observed data set should identify the sub-population to which an individual observation belongs. Formally a mixture model corresponds to the mixture distribution that represents the probability distribution of observations in the overall population. However, while problems associated with ""mixture distributions"" relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations, ""mixture models"" are used to make statistical inferences about the properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled population, without sub-population identity information.\nMixture models should not be confused with models for compositional data, i.e., data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value (1, 100%, etc.). However, compositional models can be thought of as mixture models, where members of the population are sampled at random. Conversely, mixture models can be thought of as compositional models, where the total size reading population has been normalized to 1.']","['A mixture model is a probabilistic model that represents a combination of multiple probability distributions. It is a flexible tool for modeling data that can be represented as a mixture of different underlying distributions.\n\n\n\nIn a mixture model, the data is assumed to be generated by a mixture of different probability distributions, rather than a single distribution. Each of these distributions is referred to as a component of the mixture model. The mixture model assigns a weight to each component, indicating the probability that a data point was generated by that component. The weights sum to 1, and they represent the probability that a data point was generated by each of the components.\n\n\n\nMixture models are commonly used in a variety of applications, including density estimation, clustering, and classification.

It is possible that the heights of the individuals in this population are distributed according to a normal distribution, but it is also possible that the distribution is more complex, with multiple modes or outliers. In this case, a mixture model could be used to model the data by fitting a normal distribution and an additional distribution to represent the complex structure of the data.']",,wiki_csai,18604
"Please explain what is ""Symbolic AI""","['In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. \nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel\'s Checker\'s Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant\'s PAC learning, Quinlan\'s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]\nNeural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt\'s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn\'t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]']","['Symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and logic-based methods to solve problems.

The symbols represent concepts or entities in the problem domain, and the rules represent the relationships between those concepts or entities. For example, a symbolic AI system might be designed to solve a puzzle by representing the different pieces of the puzzle as symbols and using rules to manipulate those symbols and find a solution.\n\n\n\nSymbolic AI systems are often based on first-order logic, which allows them to represent and reason about the properties of objects and the relationships between them.

"Please explain what is ""Technological singularity""","['The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I.J. Good\'s intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.\nThe first person to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\nThe concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to ""the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole"", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\'s 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction.[10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\nProminent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.[12] One claim made was that the artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.']","['The technological singularity is a hypothetical future event that is associated with the creation of superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI).

The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field.[d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations.

"Please explain what is ""Computational complexity""","['In computer science, the computational complexity or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it.

Both areas are highly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound on the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm. Moreover, for designing efficient algorithms, it is often fundamental to compare the complexity of a specific algorithm to the complexity of the problem to be solved. Also, in most cases, the only thing that is known about the complexity of a problem is that it is lower than the complexity of the most efficient known algorithms. Therefore, there is a large overlap between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. \nAs the amount of resources required to run an algorithm generally varies with the size of the input, the complexity is typically expressed as a function n → f(n), where n is the size of the input and f(n) is either the worst-case complexity (the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed over all inputs of size n) or the average-case complexity (the average of the amount of resources over all inputs of size n). Time complexity is generally expressed as the number of required elementary operations on an input of size n, where elementary operations are assumed to take a constant amount of time on a given computer and change only by a constant factor when run on a different computer.
