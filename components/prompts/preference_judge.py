preference_judge_prompt = """You are an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants (A and B) to the user question displayed below. You should choose the assistant that you think is better. Begin your evaluation by comparing the two responses and provide a short explanation. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible. Only output tie if the two responses are almost exactly the same.

Here is the prompt and the outputs of A and B respectively:
